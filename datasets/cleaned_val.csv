8554,i found this movie immensely interesting yet a little jaded it talks of violence and what there doing i still don t see the point in becoming terrorists in order to stop the terrorists we have similar people in the united states and other countries justifying the use of violence and war tactics because they think they are right think of the puritans and the christian crusades against the islamic people during the medieval times lots of blood and death far exceeding the violence of today the western world has had a negative impact on the religion i do not justify their actions but western culture in the past has had a very negative effect on some but still do remember the majority of the islamic people are peaceful people of any nation feel some sort of patriotism but to start a war on the fact that i m right and your wrong needs to be rethought again i repeat you cannot stop terrorists by becoming like them,0

2443,i rented the matrix revisited with a friend of mine we both loved the matrix and we both love filmmaking so we wanted to see what was going on behind the scenes of the matrix it turns out that the matrix revisited tells you hardly anything about the art of filmmaking or even how the matrix was made it is basically a huge commercial for the matrix a movie that the target audience of the matrix revisited has already seen if you really want to know about the process and the troubles and the stress and the detail that went into making of the matrix look no further than the bonus features on the original dvd of the matrix there are things they show in those documentaries that i had not even realized had to be done or was done the matrix was such a difficult and challenging film to make that it deserves more credit than a documentary that s about as informative and interesting as an mtv special,0
15172,i really think this movie deserves some oscars i really don t care what people can say badly about this movie because it s a really well played parts from samuel l jackson and mainly by christina ricci i m a big fan of hers right since i saw her in addams family been trying to watch all things she makes and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played i love her looks even though people say she s not pretty i think she is and i love her eyes the movie is about many things people say that is religious people say that it s about racism people say that is about drugs people say that is about nymphomania well maybe is a little bit of all that but what i truly feel is that this movie has a high level of eye opening for what blues is what it stands for and mainly were it comes from life heart pain sorrow and above all spontaneous feelings i hope you get to see it if you are that kind of person that likes a movie not only from the pictures or the story it tells this is a good movie to see if your not well see it anyway cant hurt that much and you get to see christina ricci acting so horny she s a fox,1
12352,i saw this in a preview screening and have to say that this documentary style movie is the biggest load of tripe i have ever seen completely unfunny low budget boring rubbish script terrible acting the entire audience young and old sat through the film comatose without laughing for most of it there were literally only about 2 places you will laugh in the entire moviemany people left halfway can t blame them i stayed thinking that the film would pick up however it never did and i wish i d left the humour was really lame and i am surprised that this ever made it on to the big screen i am not someone who is offended by the adult content of this movie at all it just wasn t funny the people who made this movie really don t deserve your money so please don t pay to see this film this isn t even funny enough to be shown on tv let alone cinema i wanted to give it 0 out of 10 but the system won t allow it,0
7026,milla stands out in this movie because of her personal sense of style and the way the clothes hang on her i have learned to hate that crumpled little three year old face she makes whenever she pretends to cry it makes any points she is trying to make as a serious actress drop off quickly of course in a movie with a baldwin and denise she still shines as a mature actor person david seemed to be doing woody allen by way of howdy doody not a single word or gesture in the entire movie seemed sincere or even sincerely acted how harry met sally and two weddings and funeral even sleepless in seattle had scripts locations and actors the script seemed to be a string of bad and crude gags separated by a lot of talking the locations seemed to be within a few blocks of each other there are only two actors in this dishrag of an indie flick milla and the lady who played the chick who was into the stars i watched most of this through the first time with the sound off just watching milla that subscript gag was old the first time i saw it and it s a silly rip off of a song in how to succeed in business without really trying,0
17061,murder over new york is an entertaining entry in the charlie chan series of films but if you re paying attention a lot of plot holes reveal themselves to the observant eye while traveling to new york city for an annual police convention chan sidney toler meets former scotland yard investigator hugh drake frederick worlock on the same flight now employed by military intelligence drake is tracking paul narvo and his hindu servant suspected for acts of sabotage around the world drake believes that by contacting narvo s elusive wife he ll be able to pin down the whereabouts of the master criminal when drake winds up dead in the library of george kirby president of the metropolitan aircraft corporation charlie theorizes that he was killed by a recently discovered poisonous gas called tetrogene administered via a glass pellet that releases the poison when broken summoning kirby to bring all of his dinner party guests together chan and police inspector vance donald macbride question those in attendance as one of them may be the killer among them are herbert fenton melville cooper a fellow oxford student of drake s actress june preston joan valerie unknown to drake but requested by him to attend ralph percy kane richmond the chief designer at kirby s aircraft company and keith jeffrey john sutton kirby s stock broker kirby butler boggs leyland hodgson is also a suspect especially after number 2 son jimmy victor sen yung catches him steaming open a cablegram the contents of which concern boggs himself there are some other cleverly planted characters in the proceedings as well mrs narvo turns up as patricia west marjorie weaver and contrary to drake s suspicion that she might lead him to narvo is actually on the run away from her former husband and a disastrous marriage she s involved with david elliott robert lowery principal of a chemical research firm and thereby a suspect in the tetrogene angle as with many chan films racial comments must be taken in stride with the proceedings this one offers two glaring ones when kirby s black servant is brought in for questioning he states that he doesn t know anything about drake s murder that he s completely in the dark chan s response condition appear contagious later following inspector vance s order to round up all the hindu s in new york jimmy chan comments on their arrival with they re all beginning to look alike to me actually the scene provides one of the elements of comic relief in the movie as shemp howard impersonates hindu mystic the great rashid but is actually uncovered by the police to be con artist shorty mccoy before the movie s over two more victims fall to the clever narvo his confederate ramullah and aircraft magnate kirby himself to uncover the killer chan in concert with elliott arranges for a test flight aboard a newly developed tr4 bomber after discovering a poisoned capsule planted by mechanics on the plane the day before before it can release it s deadly poison the brit fenton catches the falling capsule in mid air revealing that he knew about the plant arrested and brought in for questioning chan asserts that fenton is not narvo the real narvo reveals himself when he offers a poisoned cup of water to the nervous fenton anxious to maintain narvo s secret but chan was clever enough to be wary of such an attempt and reveals the real murderer narvo now in the guise of stock broker jeffrey having undergone reconstructive surgery following a car accident now for the plot holes when first investigating hugh drake s murder it was maintained by the police that fingerprints found in the library did not match those of any of the dinner guests however jeffrey narvo was present at the dinner party it had already been established that drake had one non party visitor in the library chemist elliott if the fingerprints really did not belong to narvo then making them an issue was pointless also at the end of the film when narvo offers fenton the poisoned water how did he think he would get away with it with everyone there as a witness but going even one better than that how would a world traveling saboteur like narvo have the time and wherewithal to establish himself as a new york city stockbroker it just doesn t make sense for trivia fans a few more points bear mentioning in the film number 2 son jimmy is a college student studying chemistry as he comes to pop s aid to solve the case in the prior chan film charlie chan at the wax museum jimmy was a law student the poison gas formula would get reworked in a later chan film this time by monogram with roland winters in the chan role in docks of new orleans in that story poison gas is released from shattered radio tubes in similar fashion to claim its victims,1
24007,i was skeptical before going to this because of the horribly assembled trailer which made it look like an equally horrible movie i was nicely surprised by how much i did not waste my money i believe the films success comes from how creepy it really is and how the environment of the house is little things like the sensor lights create a true uneasy feeling the shadows and ominously cold feeling of the house make it easy to tell that no matter how much you know horror films anything could happen in the film the acting is by no means perfect nor were they bad the main character is convincing even given the annoying teen dramas that surround her in the end i was thoroughly impressed with the film in most aspects it is definitely a film i would recommend,1
16259,in these modern times as subject known quite well to the director of the short film that this german count is going to talk about politically correct films are the leitmotiv of the modern young filmmakers projects shoulder arms directed by herr charlie chaplin during wwi the film was released only a few weeks before the armistice is an obvious example of why the early cinema pioneers were a very bold people certainly to direct a humorous film inspired in the terrible bloody first world war was a complicated matter that only few directors with those dangerous and daring ideas could be allowed to do to venture upon such delicate enterprise and with success was reserved only to geniuses as this german count said shoulder arms was made during wwi that time in where definitely the whole world lost its innocence fortunately not the german fat heiresses of this aristocrat and it is a hilarious inventive social satire about that and any war the film it is full of great gags and entertaining film continuity for a story in where that tramp will live though risky and courageous adventures in the front whether a hero for the allies or not to mock the war trenches the unhealthiness the frontal attacks and the germans how you dare by the way there are a lot of inaccuracies in the film the german soldiers by that time had moustaches and longer beards not to mention that the kaiser lacks many medals in his uniform in an elegant funny and delicate way it is even today a film miracle impossible of being surpassed keeping in mind those terrible wartime circumstances the difficult task is only possible thanks to a lot of creativity and talent obviously herr charlie chaplin had very much of it and now if you ll allow me i must temporarily take my leave because this german count must go back to the schloss trenches herr graf ferdinand von galitzien http ferdinandvongalitzien blogspot com,1
15208,spoilers ahead it is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch a disappointment i thought this was full of silly clich s andthat it basically tried to hard to the american guys out there how many of you spend yourtime jumping on your girlfriend s bed and making monkeysounds to the married girls how many of you have suddenlygone from prudes to nymphos overnight but not with yourhusband to the french would you really ask about someonebeing la fac when you know they don t speak french wouldn tyou use a more common word like universit i lived in france for a while and i sort of do know and understandeurope and i love it but my german roommate and i found thispretty insulting overall it looked like a movie funded by theeuropean parliament and it tried too hard basically it had allsorts of differences that it tried to tie together not a bad thing initself but the result is at best awkward but in fact ridiculous toomany clashes that wouldn t really happen then the end of themovie the last 10 minutes ruined all the rest why doesn t xaviertalk to the erasmus students he meets back in paris why doeshe just walk off why does he just run away from his job is that freedom and in the end is the new europe supposed to rest ona bunch of people who smoke up and shag all day is this whatit s made up of besides the acting was pretty horrible i can t believe judithgodr che s role and acting why was she made to look likeemanuelle b art so much at first i thought xavier was ok butwith retrospect i think he was pretty bad and that s all really too bad because technically opening credits scenes when he s asking what papers he needs it was reallygood except for sound editing around the british siblings and thesoundtrack was great too so the form was good but the contentpretty horrible,1
20967,i have seen this movie maybe a 100 times never grow tired of it i saw this movie the first time when i was 7 years old and it has left a mark in my memories since then its a enchanting love story that brings the sun out in most people even in the darkest times i think that this is a must see movie and one of anthony quinn s best performance ever i just wish that the tv channels would send this movie more often it has inspired me in a good way and surly will do that to many others if there is any actor i wanted to meet it would have been anthony quinn there will never be a like of him on the silver screens ever wish that anthony quinn was still alive may god bless his soul,1
6493,now the television schedules in england at least are crammed with home improvement bargain hunting house hunting and cookery shows in the afternoons the chances of any of the terrestrial broadcasters digging out a complete obscurity like this to occupy a couple of hours of screen time on a slow afternoon are slender to say the least but back in the eighties the bbc did just that and guess what i watched it and it s a testament to the overwhelming weirdness of this hungarian american co production that i can still remember large chunks of it over twenty years later to begin with the eponymous hero appears briefly during the opening titles only to vanish again for at least half an hour imagine an american tail re edited so feivel is nowhere to be seen and you ll appreciate how confusing this is there s a supremely bizarre bit of animation where one of the characters gets his elaborately waxed moustache tweaked and stretched complete with a boingy sound effect that causes him to go boss eyed probably hilarious if you re stoned but to a child quite disturbing speaking of which the infamous hippo cull scene is represented in an abstract manner clouds in vague hippo shapes are struck by lightning but it s still pretty unpleasant in fact this film is pretty cold and uninvolving throughout a sad state of affairs hardly helped by the strange looking production design all muddy colours wobbly lines bloated forms and that uniquely european bleakness reminiscent of jan svankmajer only not as compelling then to cap it all we get songs by the osmonds this isn t so much an awful film as a deeply misguided one not so much phantasmagorical as a rather bad trip,0
12836,i have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of coppola s masterpiece i was lucky enough to meet martin sheen outside the santa monica civic auditorium one night in 1981 as he waited for charlie and emilio to leave a concert he was very humble about the praise i shared with him for this work of art especially his portrayal of the young captain this is without a doubt a must see a complete 10 and an important part of american film history charlie don t surf robert duvall s famous line the other one does not need repeating as it has become an oft repeated anthem and his pattonesque character will long be remembered as a classic american war hawk in the john wayne tradition it is a surprise to see how young laurence fishburne looks,1
5567,really here the french cinema hits rock bottom and compared to it the least appealing of the american adolescent horror movies the likes of friday the thirteenth freddy and co are masterpieces of the seventh art it s all the more infuriating as there were exciting original elements the for t de broc liande and its legends the druids and king arthur all were splendid assets for a dreamlike fantasy and horror film alas filmed as an user aptly pointed out in a fake forest near paris the movie is fake horror fake celtic history fake vestiges you should see the professor wilms who was a wonderful m le quesnoy in la vie est un long fleuve tranquille scream for the invaluable scrap which the production probably bought in a dime store fake characters fake excavations the boys disguised as druids are unintentionally very funny so are the girls who seem to be experts in martial arts and what can we say of the professors of the monster a ten year old would write a better screenplay than this grotesque farce to think that people can spend money for such drivel when artists are still waiting for a producer word to the wise maurice leblanc wrote a marvelous story dealing with druids and old ceremonies in his arsene lupin saga called l le aux trente cercueils a miniseries was made 30 years ago avoid this broceliande garbage and try to see it instead,0
6439,this movie is about a group of women perhaps not of the highest repute who are heading to a small fort to take over a recently departed uncles property where they plan to set up shop upon arrival in a nearby city they find no one will go there even though its only 15 miles away so they walk when they get there they find there are no soldiers but a good amount of people who have taken over use of the fort and built up a small city nearby they soon find that something isn t right here and fort mcmillan ft doom as the locals call it is in some serious trouble rather than go into the plot line i will make some comments about things i noticed about the movie first off the acting is very flat only a few of the people seem to be real enough to believe in my first though was poor acting but at the end i watched some of the outtakes and these same people became alive so my only thought left is this is how the director wanted it on top of the bad acting i have a great problem where the people don t react right to a given set of circumstances take for example no one would take them to ft mcmillan for any price even though its only 15 miles away yet when we arrive at the fort we find it is well maintained by a decent population of people all of whom must get supplies from some one not to mention mail etc it is supposed to take place in 1867 yet we can see the railroad car has electric lights they aren t on at least and a locomotive engine that is at least 30 years later not one of the general style of locomotives so popular at that time there are also places where you can see paved blacktop and maybe a car at one point didn t want to bother to go back and look and other anachronistic items if they had followed the rules of the world they made and let the actors be actors it might have gotten a 4 from me instead of the 2 i gave it and they rewritten it about 4 more times it might have done even better,0
11310,dude i liked buffy and angel as much as the next sci fi freak but this is too much the worst lead actress ever not even david hot pants boreanaz is able to save this crap no wonder i never watch fox it blows we totally gave it a chance and it continued to suck we watched four or five painful agonizing episodes i want to kill the execs at the network so bad why is money being spent on this drivel i don t get it and i don t support it and you should never waste your time watching this show unless you like it when your eyes bleed from their sockets crap crap crap,0
202,an interesting period picec showing us what was amazing in 1938 gosh ma a fake accident ring suing for 25 000 i guess projected into the 21st century it would amount to a lot of money the acting would amount to pure 21st century ham nice to see the president as a hard working newcomer,0
262,truly flatulent script and i was very disappointed with marc singer for agreeing to be in it i actually walked out of the theater about 15 20 minutes into it and demanded my money back i have actually walked out of a movie only 3 times in my life i am 43 years old and this is the only one that made me mad enough to demand my ticket price back if i could have i would have gotten a refund on the popcorn too this was a truly lousy movie and there is no excuse for one thing how does someone who was raised as a pre tech barbarian learn to drive a car in california driving a car is a somewhat tricky skill and in california even tricker i should know i live there,0
23546,if you re interested in learning about the real side of spying this movie is for you unlike 007 movies this shows how things really go down in the world of espionage timothy hutton and sean penn both give outstanding performances in this not so well known film certainly worth watching,1
14919,you know sometimes you just gotta have it that s how this movie is with me i am almost embarrassed to admit that i like it it is so goofy in some parts but i find myself reaching for it when i m down and just need a good laugh and trust me i am just not a goofy movie kinda guy you can read the synopsis so i don t have to bore you with that just rest assured if you like kelsey grammer you will probably like this movie one more thing be sure to watch the end credits you don t need to read them just watch them and catch the performance of in the navy by the village people and friends,1
19202,i love this movie the cast were all terrific in the portrayal of their various characters judith ivey did so well portraying a weak fearful dependent who was passive aggressive in her complaining and self involved character that it was a relief to see the character s metamorphosis blythe danner was equally appealing in her role as a somewhat judgmental jewish mother devoted wife and loving sister jonathon silmerman bob dishy stacey glick and lisa walz performed their roles equally well if you enjoy movies that relate to going through challenging times without loosing your sense of humor and hope you will love this movie,1
23717,another fantastic offering from the monkey island team and though it was a long time coming and had to survive the departure of ron gilbert it s another worthy installment my only gripe is that it was a little short seeming in comparison to the previous two though that might be because of a glorious lack of disk swapping roll on mi4,1

19494,this is a fine under rated film and rip torn well known as he is is a seriously under rated actor i read howard frank mosher s novel many years ago how well craven captures the book and the beauty of vermont s northeast kingdom i had the good fortune to grow up in vt in the 40s and 50s and was still living there when the irasburg incident took place i ve not seen stranger in the kingdom the craven mosher collaboration based on the incident and another mosher novel but this film has inspired me to track it down,1
14530,this is a forgotten classic of a film and harmony karin borrowed a ton from it for gummo gummo is good river s edge is way way better its no secret that keanu reeves isn t the best actor whoever walked the earth no in fact he s a horrendous actor but he was born for some roles ted preston esquire from bill and ted and his role in this film he is perfect as a sort of good natured but very apathetic and confused teenager then there s crispin glover i think his performance in this film is the best of his career he is phenomenal as the drugged out wackjob character then there s dennis hopper who is perfect as well this movie is simply amazing and if you haven t seen it run out and watch it today its brilliant one of the best portrayals of modern america i ve seen,1
3436,i must in light of the encomia of praise for this flick from viewers assume once again the role of the turd in the punchbowl as lowell weicker used to say i am scratching my head at the sheer number of laudatory comments the african queen this ain t the period flavor is wonderful yes the acting is fine but no actor no matter how great can bring life to the seemingly endless stream of perfectly tedious and insignificant party and dinner table conversation here and i care not how much of it is taken from joyce s text imagine spending an hour and a half as a fly on the wall at a christmas dinner of a not particularly interesting group of people it s not clear to me that it s a family as one person suggested having to listen to their mundane table talk and you have the essential experience of this movie absolutely nothing happens and nothing important is said but it is said at interminable length as i said the popularity of this movie is a mystery to me speaking of mysteries watch a good one rather than this,0

21895,it s one of the paradoxes of basil rathbone s wartime anti nazi sherlock holmes films voice of terror sh in washington and this one that while the plots and settings are mostly terrible he is so good in them despite a bizarre wind swept hairstyle meant to make him look younger he blazes through every scene with so much bite and attack that you hardly register how flimsy the plots are here he also has great acting rapport with lionel atwill who makes a wonderfully repulsive professor moriarty a heavy lidded cockroach with nice hints of sadism and depravity it may not have been acting kids at the climax changed into a lab coat in order to drain rathbone s blood drop by drop he s as over the top sinister as seinfeld s arch nemesis newman the movie itself is ancient kiddie matin e fare but it benefits from director roy william neill s attention to staging and atmosphere it also looks fairly sharp in the dvd s ucla restoration don t even think of buying any other edition all of them faded choppy public domain prints,1

7790,i saw this short film on the dvd for ridley scott s film the duellists there was no introduction by scott before the film it just started right up boy and a bicycle is hardly an example of ridley scott s other work it bears no resemblance the film shows a boy played by tony scott riding around on a bicycle guess what that s pretty all that happens the boy rides around rambling on and on with pointless confusing dialogue the film was shot in black and white and since it was directed by ridley scott i expected some cool cinematography or visually striking sets instead i was treated with nothing this film isn t even good for a first effort however i recommend that any fan of ridley scott should check it out at least once,0
12833,captain willard martin sheen has been sent on a classified mission into cambodia during the vietnam war to assassinate colonel kurtz marlon brando as he has gone completely insane and is no longer taking orders and since kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the armed forces it is hard for capt willard to understand how col kurtz could go off the deep end as he has killing without clearance and taking the war into his own hands what possibly could have pushed this great man over the top through willard s long journey through the jungle to find his target he tries with some success to understand why but what will he decide to do once he finds him any movie that can start out with the doors the end is a great movie in my book especially if it can flow with the mood and imagery shown with the song apocalypse now does this perfectly i can t think of anything better for it to be set to the vietnam war and the insanity in the soliders minds that it created an is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through some of the hairiest jungle in vietnam the ultimate destination of which is murder through it s use of music and score alone we are thrown into a dark world of mystery violence and insanity a perfect example of how to set mood through music alone is this film right here an overall great cast with the exception of laurence fishburne of which sheen and brando give us more than enough acting skills to spread around on our movie desire bread i just don t like fishburne ever since i found out he was cowboy curtis in peewee s playhouse my contempt and hatred for this man has increased ten fold i realize the pettiness of this but i simply do not care we need to sick gary oldman on him brando is excellent as col kurtz and i can t think of any other actor that could have played the good man gone insane and hold such screen presence sheen is also fun to watch as willard and we can identify with his questioning of his mission and the war in general my favorite character in the movie has to be robert duvall s lt colonel kilgore before this film i never pictured duvall as a wartime cowboy but honestly it s my favorite of his parts to date he simply nailed his character which is one of the best in the entire film as the gung ho air cavalry commander who loves to surf maybe a little over the top but still brilliant i also love the smell of napalm in the morning the plot is a fairly simple one and it doesn t take too much brainpower to figure out what s going on willard s mission is to kill kurtz plain and simple but it s the journey of the film that is really it s heart and also the dire situations of war itself in the redux version we are forced to sit through the extended french plantation scene and the playboy bunny scene which really adds nothing to the film s entirety other than it makes it a longer journey i don t feel they take away anything though it s just a matter of if you want to watch a three and a half hour movie or the original through this journey the film points out the utter futility and irrelevance of the war to the americans and the massive effect it had on the soldiers who fought in it in fact that s the entire point on top of that the troops were not supported by the public and that could very well have helped cause a character like kurtz to go completely mad a big war movie lover this one is up there with platoon and the deer hunter all of them classics i sometimes try to compare films of the same genre to one another but it has gotten me in trouble in the past in my reviews as i have had to go back on what i ve said all three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the vietnam war so to really say one is better than the other is fairly pointless even if after having most recently view an i think it s a tad better in the end apocalypse now is a true classic in either version and worthy of the status it s been given as a fellow reviewer has previously stated an is one of the most ambitious films ever made,1
7989,years ago ma2412 the feature film tried to be some kind of regional blockbuster in austria one thing s for sure i hope no one outside will ever have to see this one perhaps if you are familiar with the original sitcom it could be interesting to watch what director sicheritz made of his series i think he missed his chance and wasted time and money so far many director s and writers have failed to make a series concept compatible to a 90min movie consider alf inspector gadget you can see how hard this is by watching ma 2412 the result of this attempt in my opinion tastes like a never ending tv episode and not a good one it fails to deliver a plot the humor tries too hard and the directing seems very unfocused as holds true for the visual style so summing up i d clearly not recommend this one,0
9062,a total and absolute waste of time bad acting bad story predictable simple pathetic after a while i was only watching to see what happens since i d already invested my time into it totally surprised mrs forlani played in a weak movie as this honestly just don t bother a total and absolute waste of time bad acting bad story predictable simple pathetic after a while i was only watching to see what happens since i d already invested my time into it totally surprised mrs forlani played in a weak movie as this honestly just don t bother a total and absolute waste of time bad acting bad story predictable simple pathetic after a while i was only watching to see what happens since i d already invested my time into it totally surprised mrs forlani played in a weak movie as this honestly just don t bother,0
16425,in an early scene luca david pasquesi and james jeff garlin are walking down a neighborhood street in chicago admiring the bucolic architecture when a woman angrily arguing in french on a cell phone passes by them prompting james to remark there s nothing hotter than an angry french woman a few blocks later they pass an old filipino woman also angry also arguing on a cell phone and luca remarks for referential effect there s nothing hotter than an angry elderly filipino woman the humor in jeff garlin s i want someone to eat cheese with is best characterized by the word quotidian the film is a conversation we might as well be eavesdropping rather than go for antics the film relies on character flaws and human curiosity to deliver laughs while it s not innovative it is far from banal and even if james views himself as being rather jejune we know that he is fairly average and this endears him self betterment is the primary theme of the movie sarah silverman who plays beth is excellent as the catalyst of change she revitalizes james and so reminds him to live a better life even so achieving some idyllic dream is not the end of these characters but rather something simpler that they might pick up what pieces there are of the life they love just to keep for themselves at least enough to carry on a movie about life lessons can be overwrought as it can forget to connect with its audience i want someone to eat cheese with is subtle and winsome and while its moral may not be inspiring it is still resonant this is low key comedy but it will stick with you,1
7546,this is going to be my first review on imdb and i m glad that the standard rating is 1 out of 10 because then i don t have to change anything first there are awful movies movies you can make a laughter out of like island city battlefield earth or conan the destroyer that is totally acceptable they makes a great party enhancer then there are the worst movie ever i cannot believe how utterly crappy this steaming pile of dog turd was i found it on a second hand store on vhs and bought it quickly because i like sci fi terminator post apocalypse and stuff like that everything on the box art was very promising then i loaded in the tape quickly when i got home and the first thing that i noticed was what there was maybe 10 minutes or more of switching between present clips and flashbacks in a very annoying blue effect with sounds that makes you puke and it just continues over and over then some acting kicks in and you wonder why you were ever born in a world where this abomination of mankind actually exists and then i realized there are actually two prequels i didn t think about it first but the title says 3 in it and i was horrified but as i actually in great pain and agony watch it to the end i thought nothing could ever make me feel worse about myself and this universe but then a little text showed up saying next and nemesis 4 no please no,0
12695,sick of the current cinema output particularly american cinema i ve been making an effort to see the oscar winning foreign films that s when i came across this gem slow to start it picks up nicely once war is declared basically an old fashioned girl waits for boy to return from war story the performances the cinematography make this so very much more why tatyana samojlova as the young woman didn t become an international star after this is beyond me though she has remained successful in her own country you take the journey with her young defiant impetuous young girl who through the ravages of war becomes a very sober somber woman who keeps a glimmer of hope her final scene is devastating we love her as much as the camera does and the camera work was this the pioneer in hand held camera work it truly adds an immediacy to the story and the beauty of it like when tatyana s character is running up stairs and next to a slatted fence i am humbled and grateful to see this film,1
5971,in the 3rd installment of left behind the makers did not care to put any kind of continuity into the plot although all weapons on the planet have been confiscated by the united nations world war iii suddenly begins at the snap of a finger within a few split seconds the ex lover of one of the main protagonists moves from passionately seducing him to outright hatred to a melancholy confession of love without any trace of direction but foremost this film is really an irony free zone after the president of the united states accepts jesus as his savior he immediately becomes a suicide bomber and blows up a skyscraper in the middle of the city osama bin laden will be very jealous when he sees this film,0
22157,this is the greatest show ever made next to south park i love this show it is so funny and peter s laugh is hilarious you need to watch this show right away for the few people who have never seen this show before one of my favorite shows of all time if you can try to see some of the later episodes such as i dream of jesus or tales of a third grade nothing but there s never been an episode i didn t like all of the episodes are absolutely hilarious it s got a great satire to it as well you can find a lot of clips on you tube if you re somewhere near a computer or a tv see it right away however you can,1
2427,i remember when the love machine was first released to theaters i was a mere 13 years old too young to see the much ballyhooed motion picture release but not too old to take my mom s paperback copy of the jacqueline susann novel to school and pore over the naughty bits with my schoolmates though i m not sure what my problem was at such an early age but i was very much into the book i bought and wore an ankh ring just like on the paperback cover and i remember the ads for the perfume xanadu that was cross promoted and featured clumsily in the film despite such an interest i didn t actually see the film until several years later i should have left things as they were the love machine is hands down the worst of the many bad films adapted from susann s novels which of course makes it the most fun to watch its faults are many from its hopscotching script that jumps choppily from one incident to another with nary a connecting thread its dated horny brass instruments i mean music score of ersatz bacharach the flat first take performances the boring sexuality i ve never seen bathrobes featured so prominently in a movie before it s like a fetish whenever sex nudity or something sleazy is called for out pops somebody in a blue robe very odd that and most certainly the circus train of awful 70 s fashions that are on endless display poor dyan cannon s performance which is no great shakes anyway but heads over the rest of the cast is consistently undermined by the jaw dropping get ups she s called upon to wear however the film s chief liability is the stoic stone like john philip law as appropriately enough robin stone the object of every girl s and one over the top flaming male photographer s affection law is just awful and performs as if he were pulled off the street handed the pages of the script in hurry and told to give a cold reading on the spot just lifeless not only that but he appears in desperate need of a blood transfusion or something he looks wan and sickly throughout and is several pounds smaller than most of his female costars robin stone should be a hunk not a hankie for anyone finding the film hard going it s rather slow by today s standards i beg you to stick around for the climactic fight scene here ms cannon balancing 23 pounds of teased hair finally abandons her heretofore starchy acting style and lets loose with that infectiously raucous laugh of hers setting in motion a truly memorable free for all that should have become a cinema clip highlight by now trying to rival valley of the dolls s infamous wig down the toilet scene the love machine finally does something right jacqueline susann s unique brand of trash is sorely missed perhaps someone out there owns the rights to rona barrett s the lovomaniacs and will revive the genre,0
7916,asia argento is a sexy beautiful woman who likes to run around naked which isn t a bad thing in it s self but when her character talks about all the guys she serviced and to see her with michael madsen and an asian guy in the present tense of the movie it made me feel like i needed a condom over my eyes to watch this movie like a disease was going to rub off on me or something the movie felt like it was going for a love triangle drama action plot it just seemed to go everywhere and nowhere at the same time the acting was great the plot not so great the director needs to at least pick a genre and practice practice practice before trying to do something as complicated as this again because they are not very good at it obviously,0
9879,ok this movie seems to have been pretty well covered by earlier comments but there are a couple of items i wish to add the mad scientist is producing a serum from the blood of a caged animal in order to turn a man into a werewolf if we suspend our disbelief enough to buy into that fine but the animal in the cage is a coyote that would make a werecoyote did audiences in 1942 not know the difference between a wolf and a coyote they re easy to tell apart that s weak secondly this movie was covered in the third episode of mst3k on the comedy channel it took joel and the bots a number of episodes to get up to full riffing steam and they weren t up there quite yet on this one they did add enough to this snoozer to keep you awake until the end but it was not one of their better episodes they never even mentioned the glaring omission of an actual wolf and that joke was just hanging in the air waiting to be smacked,0
11599,cheap gloriously bad cheese from the 80 s the decade of cheese i watched this one first uncut and un mst3k ed and it was pretty much laugh out loud funny even without the comments the plot such as it is revolves around a post apocalyptic world in which the ai robots revolted sound familiar and destroyed pretty much everything leaving a world in ruins with air so bad no one can breathe it the few humans that are left act as slaves to an enigmatic being called the dark one which seems to be part computer and part organic being the air slaves work to produce energy for this being in return for breathable air every once in a while the dark one has the strongest of the air slaves fight to the death so that no one will rise as a leader in a revolt against the dark one okay that s the so called serious stuff on to the silly stuff such as the ridiculous quasi futuristic clothing that everyone sports including car seat cover fur garments loin cloths and spangly stuff and feather boas worn mostly by the dark one s henchwoman a chick with an unrecognizable and almost non understandable accent or the wooden acting and stilted lines sported by all of the so called actors who s dialog is high on pretension and low on sense or the dime store special fx including pink socks with teeth glued onto them for deadly sewer snakes a bomb made of strung piano wire and a tin can and terrible mutants with halloween rubber masks on a band of air slaves follow their leader a mysterious wanderer who has adapted to the air outside to go to the energy plant to destroy the dark one the guy s name is neo which explains where the wachowski brothers got the idea for the matrix they meet up with a group of amazons along the way with the obligatory fight scene in which the female is bested of course has anyone else ever noticed that in every amazon movie or t v show ever produced these so called amazing warriors always get their butts kicked by either men or women amazons are just pansies i guess this band of determined warriors makes their way through central park errr the ravaged lands beyond the last standing city good way to save money on the matte paintings of a destroyed new york city anyway and journey into the sewers leading to the power station where the dark one and his go go girl henchwoman valeria hang out here they vanquish such ferocious beasts as the sock puppet worms a giant spider no one sees and the goofy lobster robot who is one of the dark one s personal guard the final showdown is pretty sad one of the slaves a girl who s father was taken by the dark one because he d produced a way for people to breathe the foul air sees that her father has been consumed by the dark one s true form which involves him being eaten by a giant avocado until only his head is sticking out the three remaining adventurers destroy the dark one by turning off a few switches and the robot holocaust dies not with a bang but with a whimper the two humans exchange some amazingly wooden last lines and that s it the end,0
18159,my local pbs station whyy philadelphia recently showed the elegant universe after three hours of watching it besides having my brain hurt i learned all about wormholes quantum mechanics and parallel realities and alternate universes the last hour of the show was about string theory physics a semi new branch of physics which makes many of the the ideas of science fiction not only possible but probable with the string theory it sounds like wormholes alternate realities and alternate timelines are possible and it could just be a matter of time until we get the knowledge to use them although it may not have given new information to someone familiar with the topic i found the show very interesting and informative it was very understandable to anyone who is just being introduced to this subject,1
11008,it wasn t the worst movie that i have ever seen however that is only if i get to count home movies made by 8 year olds this movie was horrible from start to finish nothing about it made it worth watching unless you wanted to show new filmmakers how not to make a film,0
2205,well anne is way way too old wentworth looks younger than she and he should not louisa is much too young and too cheerful oh sister mary is way too pretty she is supposed to be average not pretty when this actress complains the way mary should all i think is that she is too pretty to be a complainer lady russell is too old this is crazy if you read the novel she is anne s older more mature friend maybe as old as annes mother would be which would be around 18 20 years older than anne so around 50 not 70 its crazy doesn t fit how come anne is so darn happy in the beginning she smiles when she says oh the worst is over i ve seen him now the worst has passed yeah right ok if anyone has seen the 1995 roger michell version than you cant compare these two that one is right on this one is way off read the novel and you ll know what i mean,0
18412,this movie is a hard to find gem it is the story of juliette a perfectly ordinary cleaning woman who works in the large corporate office of a yogurt company and romuald the president of same he takes no notice of her he takes no notice of anyone until several plots to wrest his company away from him all hit at the same time he is lost no one to turn to and no one to trust when he discovers juliette as the cleaning woman no one pays any attention to her so they say and do incriminating things in front of her that she is smart enough to catch on to and use to help her helpless and hapless boss the complications are wild she is not so ordinary as she seems with five children from five different ex husbands who are all still madly in love with her and he is not so shrewd as he thinks he is this movie doesn t follow a predictable path and that s what keeps you watching the acting is superb and there are some very moving moments along the way as well the working class displays more savvy than those above them almost in the same way gosford park showed the upper crust is not all it s cracked up to be mentally i recommend this movie very much see it 9 10,1
8433,when the film started i got the feeling this was going to be something special the acting and camera work were undoubtedly good i also liked the characters and could have grown to empathise with them the film had a good atmosphere and there was a hint of fantasy however as the film went on the plot never appeared to takeoff and just rolled on scene by scene i was unable to understand the connection between the stories all i could see was the characters occasionally bumping into each other and references to ships in bottles without that connection i was just left with a few unremarkable short stories am surprised it did so well at cannes,0
17524,though short lived the amazing spider man was one of the best made for tv versions of a famed comic book hero only wonder woman lynda carter the best of the genre and the incredible hulk bill bixby lou ferrigno were better the amazing spider man outclasses the 1966 1968 batman because the high camp elements of the latter often ruin the adventure spider man outclasses all three television interpretations of superman lois and clark smallville and of course the george reeves superman which brings up the rear the amazing spider man was an action drama during the late 1970 s the pre cgi era when stunts had to be performed by stunt men not in the database of a computer spider man had its own very talented stuntman to perform the death defying daredevil acrobatics his name was fred waugh who donned the spidy suit for the action sequences nicholas hammond better known as one of julie andrew s children on the all time movie classic the sound of music was spider man during the dialogue scenes hammond s spider man also had his own secret identity as peter parker similar to christopher reeve superman clark kent adam west batman bruce wayne and of course lynda carter as wonder woman diana prince it s unfortunate that the series only had thirteen episodes because when the first episode hit the airwaves in november of 1977 the entire country was watching it on cbs that wednesday night in all fairness cbs should release this pilot episode as well as the deadly dust the captive tower etc on dvd shortly spider man was short lived but did have a cult following and in my opinion was a heck of a lot better than the movie interpretation of the famed comic book hero starring toby mcguire cbs might be hesitant to release these episodes for two reasons a there might not be a broad market for them based on the lack of longevity of the series and a generation of children and young people who weren t born when the series originally aired in the 1970 s b one of the early spider man episodes dealt with a terrorist with designs on the world trade center which was attacked twice many years after this show went off the air in 1993 and of course the devastating attack against this country on 9 11 01 in which the towers were destroyed and many innocent lives were lost however i don t think that it would be in bad taste to release this spider man episode even if the show was adventure derived from a comic book and camp in nature the live action amazing spider man doesn t have a large following but it has a cult following if and when cbs releases it out on dvd this cult following could be explained along with the episode in which spiderman saved the towers in 1978 but how in september of 2001 real life proved to be different from the movies i like to follow the news but i also like science fiction fantasy therefore i am eagerly awaiting the release of the amazing spider man on dvd,1
5742,what more can i add this is without doubt one of the worst films i ve ever seen terrible acting a daft script tediously slow pace even visible microphones dangling from the top of the screen i could go on but i really can t be bothered i watched this for 90 minutes before the sense of losing the will to live became too great for me i can only assume that the first set of comments and votes were from people associated with the promotion of this insult to british film making and worst still i had to buy the mail on sunday to get it the only reason the dvd hasn t now been redeployed as a coaster is that it now takes pride of place in my top 10 worst films ever collection definitely one to be avoided,0
10966,although charlie chaplin made some great short comedies in the late 1910 s others don t quite make it examples like his new job and shanghaied come to mind and i would also the floorwalker in this category charlie gets mistaken for a manager of a department store and vice versa this manager tries to steal money from the cash register and make a run for it and charlie is just an honest costumer but getting blamed for some missing objects stolen by other costumers there aren t many laughs in it except for the last couple of minutes or so with some great scenes on the escalator for the rest quite disappointing 4 10,0
3417,why did i have to go out and buy yes buy jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman maybe it was a burst of temporary mental derangement but i m guessing it s because i kind of enjoyed the first jack frost it was a silly but funny horror comedy which had some okay effects by screaming mad george that and the fact that on the back cover of the sequel there was this nice picture of this guy impaled by this giant icicle coming out of his mouth with a lot of blood and all so i thought if it s as idiotic as the first and has some nice splatter gore in it it should be fun right well i was so dead wrong let me first say that the movie deserves some credit for having an immensely insane and retarded plot i mean a mutant killer snowman on a tropical island that spawns mutant killer baby snowballs which can only be killed or harmed by bananas as much as i love the premise i really hated the movie first of all while the first jack frost looked like an actual movie seemingly being shot on real film and all this sequel has the look and feel of a third rate soap opera it has this way too slick shot on video look the lighting is just plain awful bright white spots for the day look and stupid colors like blue and green at night the acting well don t even go there the dialogues range from stiff to extremely senile that jamaican man was just moronic saying man after every sentence and when it comes to the voice of the killer snowman all i could think of was a seventh rate chucky from child s play spewing dumb and supposedly witty one liners before he kills someone the best joke was were one guy asks why are you talking to your watch and the best scene was undoubtedly the one with that beautiful asian chick popping up out of nowhere and taking a swim in the pool totally naked thank god for that oh yeah and that little scene over the end credits with those two japanese dudes on a miniature ship being badly dubbed had me laughing too but the worst thing about this movie was where was the gore and splatter action everyone is talking about there were plenty of occasions to show some decent gory killings a lot of people were killed off in original ways here but all off screen like i ve read in many other comments there were indeed nice set ups to a head explosion a crushed body eyes being poked out tongue ripped out but on the crucial moments the editor cuts away to some blood splatters on the floor or nothing at all that frontal shot of that british guy being impaled from the back cover of the dvd wasn t even in the movie i only saw that particular killing filmed from the back meaning i didn t see sh t i was waiting throughout the whole movie for that to happen and then i get to see nothing what a let down could it be that i saw a cut version of the movie that would be a shame cause only a decent amount of splatter fun could have saved this movie if you ask me seeing a lot of killer snowballs reduced to bloody pulp just didn t cut it for me speaking of those snowballs they were done very poorly they made munchies look like state of the art animatronics but i guess that was the whole point of it at some point the special effects crew even turned to some laughably bad cgi boy you really have to see it to believe it best is to not see it actually cause this flick is just too bad okay i did laugh with it for it kept getting worse and worse just stick with the first jack frost 1996 and you ll be okay just bare in mind that it s a pretty silly horror comedy but fun in it s own right it s funny but writer director michael cooney somehow must have realized that he was a pretty bad director after jack frost 2 and then focused on writing turns out he then wrote two pretty good thriller screenplays for the i inside starring ryan phillippe and identity starring john cusack so the man seems to have some talent after all now it would be far too easy to give jack frost 2 the lowest rating possible so i say one point for that naked asian babe doing the skinny dipping and one point for those completely retarded snowball babies way to go mr cooney,0
15571,this film was both entertaining and thought provoking i d recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged great acting directing and it is canadian to boot it is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers the locations in ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era with so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back an independent flick for any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or an obstacle be it financial or illness this film strikes a resounding chord it approaches the idea of the afterlife in a contemporary way without cheaply capitalizing on all the gohst and supernatural themes that have become staples in hollywood and the tv networks,1
10253,me being from australia and loving the series i wasn t expecting much from the american version of kath and kim but i thought i d watch the first episode to see if it was really that bad well whats there to say its nothing special selma blair is ok as kim and actually had a few good lines molly shannon is not a good kath though the good thing about jane turner s kath is that when she speaks with all her funny accents such as when she says yumor or noice it sounds like its just the natural way that she speaks but when shannon has a go at the accent its clear that she is acting and trying to be the same as turner and the show really misses sharon or some one else to give us something to laugh about because the kal and craig characters in this version are really not funny so far only the first episode has aired and it is clearly not up to the standards of the aussie version although if it was a stand alone television show with a different name not being compared to the aussie version it would perhaps be viewed as being a little bit better but if there is nothing else to do on a sunday night or thursday night in america then you cant do much harm in watching it or better put on some of the aussie version if you ve got it,0
19094,i was very lucky to see this film as part of the melbourne international film festival 2005 only a few days ago i must admit that i am very partial to movies that focus on human relations and especially the ones which concentrate on the tragic side of life i also love the majority of scandinavian cinematic offerings there is often a particular deep quality in the way the story unfolds and the characters are drawn character building in this film is extraordinary in its details and its depth this is despite the fact that we do encounter quite a number of characters all with very particular personal situations and locations within their community the audience at the end of the screening was very silent and pensive i am still playing some of those scenes in my mind and i am still amazed at their power and meaningfulness,1
502,i have one word focus well imdb wants me to use at least ten lines of text okay let s discuss the fine points of focus i don t know about the rest of you but in my first year of film school they taught us a lot of useless crap like you ll all be famous avant garde filmmakers someday but they also taught us how to do this crazy thing called focusing the lens it was amazing you give a little twist and wham everything is clear as a bell the person who shot what alice found needs to learn a few things about the finer points of focus lighting too this movie is not only completely out of focus it s also lit like the corner of someone s basement don t even get me started on pacing or plot they could have trimmed about ten seconds off the beginning and end of every single shot but who cares about that anyhow there is not enough lurid in this movie to make up for the utter lack of regard to film s best friends focus and lighting words to the wise,0
3584,it s difficult to find anything worth of praise with this movie it s not the worst picture ever made but that s not saying a whole lot the plot is quite incoherent and unbelievable it seems that the producers wanted to make a space movie but decided to make it underwater to cash in at the success of the abyss in some scenes it seems as if the story indeed was set to outer space initially the sub has a landing gear the technicians are worried of a rip in a rubber diving suit at the depths of several kilometers where the pressure would crush the diver and the suit like an empty beer can the movie starts out okay with planning of a recovery of a lost naval sub after that the movie takes a plunge along with the siren 2 effects are so so the navigational screens are all done on commodore 64 remember this is 1990 not 1983 the sub is controlled like no other sub ever instead of control consoles the officers have keyboards with which they enter long number sequences to control various functions of the ship the interior of the ship isn t too convincing either the final scenes leap from awkward to absurd welcome to the fifties you can check your suspension of disbelief at the door i fail to see enjoyment factor here the movie is neither good nor hilariously bad mst3k style until you get to the final scene it s like eating a slightly bad apple,0
11728,as far as asian horror goes i have seen my share of disappointments along with some of the creepiest sh t imaginable acacia doesn t really qualify for either of those categories it had a few moments of tension and was interesting to watch yet i couldn t help think that there should have been a tad more to this story the film deals with a childless couple who decide to adopt a kid who appears to have a fascination with trees he develops a bond with the acacia tree in their yard and seems to communicate with it then during a fight with his mother involving their new birth child he storms off after threatening to find his dead mother who is now a tree when he doesn t come back the parents send file a report and wait while the neighbor girl believes he somehow inhabits the acacia tree the pacing is rather slow and the ending gets a bit weird but i have to recommend this as a slightly enjoyable effort though the story feels a little flat hell i can t really make up my mind on this,0
14930,in 1895 in a small village in japan the wife of the litter carrier gisaburo takahiro tamura seki kazuko yoshiyuki has an affair with a man twenty six years younger toyiji tatsuya fuji toyiji becomes jealous of gisaburo and plots with seki to kill him they strangle gisaburo and dump his body inside a well in the woods and seki tells the locals that gisaburo moved to tokyo to work three years later the locals gossip about the fate of gisaburo and seki is haunted by his ghost the situation becomes unbearable to seki and toyiji when a police authority comes to the village to investigate the disappearance of gisaburo ai no borei is a surreal and supernatural love story the remorse and the guilty complex of seki make her see the ghost of her murdered husband spoiling the perfect plot of her lover the cinematography is jeopardized by the quality of the vhs released in brazil but there are very beautiful scenes inclusive ringu and the american remake the ring use the view of the well from inside in the same angle the performances and direction are excellent making ai no borei a great movie my vote is eight title brazil o imp rio da paix o the empire of passion,1
23683,in this episode locke and eko go searching for the symbol that we saw during the lock down on a previous episode michael having shot ana lucia and libby struggles with his actions as libby inches closer to death the most interesting thing about this episode i think is during the commercial break locke and eko find a hatch under the plane that killed boone in season one and a new training video ends with copyright the hanso foundation 1989 in a following commercial break a rather bizarre and nondescript commercial advertises the hanso foundation a planted commercial and the website advertised www sublymonal com leads the visitor through a world of information about life on the outside of lost s storyline a must see for all fans,1
1686,usually any movie with steve railsback in the lead is a good movie however this movie does not conform to that opinion lifeforce is a below average movie that is extremely confusing in the beginning reminds me of star trek tmp but is able to pick things up a bit towards the end when london becomes zombie city a horror sci fi mess that is very hard to sit through although the naked spacegirl vampire is very easy to look at this movie deserves a rating of 4 out of 10,0
7714,if you re a sucker for corny movies and are looking to see something you don t need to pay close attention to this might be worth watching the story itself is very unrealistic the dialogue is also not very believable it is doubtful you will find yourself relating to any of these characters because none of them are very likable the acting could ve been a lot worse victoria pratt is noticeably out of place with the rest of the cast as she seems to have a lot of potential and talent as an actress while it s not saying much this is one of the best acting performances i ve seen from tori spelling she appears to be getting better with age overall this extremely melodramatic movie is mediocre at best,0
19929,this comic classic of english school girl antics is and was one of the great art house classics then the art house disappeared with the arrival of videos and so did the audience for this movie the loss is not to the art houses or to this great film the loss is to those who will never have a real opportunity to view this memorable laugh filled cinematic masterpiece but i am preaching to the converted aren t i who else would search for this flick,1
23375,it has to be admitted that the best work of harold lloyd ended with his last great silent comedy speedy in 1928 after that he enters sound films like chaplin and keaton and laurel hardy and w c fields and does do better than keaton but not as well as the other three chaplin was rich enough to make his own films as producer but he paced his films so there were five years between productions laurel hardy were under the protection of hal roach so production standards for their shorts and sound films were pretty good fields first worked with mack sennett than with paramount and then free lanced lloyd tried the route that chaplin took but with less success he produced his own films but unlike chaplin he did not own his own studio also his first two choices were not good especially feet first but he did begin to choose more wisely and movie crazy the cat s paw and the milky way were all good choices these three and possibly the sin of harold diddlebock were his best sound ventures they are all entertaining but none are up to safety last the freshman the kid brother or speedy of the top four sound films the cat s paw is the most controversial ezekiel cobb s solution to ridding the city that elects him mayor is very extreme for the tastes of 2005 or is it when a movie is made dictates what it s politics are the cat s paw is from 1934 that second year of the roosevelt new deal itself rather controversial for heavier government involvement movie audiences saw films like gabriel over the white house and the phantom president where our leaders did extra constitutional actions to rid the nation of internal enemies and to force disarmament around the globe even cecil b de mille got into this act with this day and age where a bunch of teenagers use rats to force a gangster to confess his crimes to us the use of violence to force anyone even a bunch of goons and boodlers like alan dinehart s gang to confess is repellent after all the supreme court has protected us from confession under duress what we forget is that the reforms we are thinking of did not occur until the warren court and the burger court made them for example although mr justice sutherland s opinion in the powell scottsboro boys case of 1932 guaranteed every criminal defendant had a right to counsel gideon v wainwright did not extend this to ordering court paid counsel to defendants until 1962 the miranda case with it s now well known anti self incrimination warning is from 1963 nothing like this were considered necessary in 1934 if you study other movies of the period up to 1954 and even to 1960 tricks are used to get confessions kirk douglas confesses his crimes in front of witnesses in i walk alone while burt lancaster holds a gun to him when lancaster leaves douglas sneers about confessing under duress only to see the gun is unloaded suddenly he realizes that legally in 1948 he has confessed without duress hate to say it to any civil libertarians reading this note but what cobb lloyd does to dinehart and his pals in the conclusion of the cat s paw was not only legal but would have led to their jail sentences in 1934 we may call it heavy handed fascistic or horrid but it would have worked legally when it was thought up,1
11453,i m glad this was the last of the 40 s universal mummy movies the movies were all of variating qualities and this movie was definitely one of the lesser ones problem is that it s a very slow moving movie in which basically nothing interesting or exciting is ever happening perhaps it would had all been better if the mummy had made his entrance earlier on in the movie instead now the movie once again spends its first 20 minutes explaining what had all happened in the previous mummy movies by also once again using archive footage from this time the mummy from 1932 again to which this movie is the fourth mummy movie following the 1932 mummy story the movie just never knows to find the right pace and even though the movie is barely over an hour long it still feels a bit like a drag it of course also doesn t help that the movie has a rather simplistic and actually very little interesting story the movie also feels quite disjointed the first and second half of the movie don t really connect to each other and they seemed like two separate movies on their own at least lon chaney jr is still in it he once more reprises the role of the mummy kharis for the third time too bad that he has such limited screen time this time he gets unfortunately very little interesting to do which is also a big waste of the mummy character itself the movie is further more filled with dozens of silly actors who are playing around with silly accents it seemed so totally unnecessary to me that most of the characters had to speak with such an accent and it actually gets quite distracting and annoying at points the mummy movies that s least worth seeing 4 10,0
8932,this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen its been a few years since i saw it and nothing has come close since then and i doubt that there ever will be a movie produced that is as bad as this it tries to make fun of a variety of different movies for example nell and instead of funny its just pathetic whatever you do don t rent or by this garbage and if someone throws it at you turn around and run the other way,0
11088,the screaming is a very low budget horror movie that was shot on video it features passable acting poor lighting a weak story and some of the worst monster effects i ve ever seen the plot has a college student being pressured to join a cult by his attractive landlord the cult is a parody of scientology with a book similar to dianetics this would have been a funny shot at that group were it not for a dumb script and the cheapness of the production the monster effects look awful and the picture quality makes it feel like you re watching a home video or a public service announcement i think anyone who sees this will agree that movies should be shot on film,0
17562,to qualify my use of realistic in the summary not many old folks i know go around pretending to be famous maestros blind people etc nor have i ever been elderly those minor issues out of the way the relationships between the characters in this film and the emotions expressed therein were completely realistic and genuine in fact though we re not yet 30 i could see many characteristics of my relationship with my wife in the interactions between the main character and his wife for those that don t die young there s a great line in the movie about this when the two best friends are talking about dying young and one of them says and i m paraphrasing we missed our chance we ll just have to stick it out we ll all be where these characters are some day i know many movie goers would prefer to be swept away from reality as opposed to being faced with it but even they might enjoy the sweet reminder of our mortality and the importance of living life to the fullest that this film is,1
14218,it was september 2003 that i heard the bbc were going to resurrect doctor who and make it bigger and better but i d heard these rumours in the press before and thought that s all they were rumours but it was then mentioned that russell t davies was going to executively produce and write the show and then one saturday afternoon in march 2004 channel 4 news interviewed the actor cast in the title role christopher eccleston yes that christopher eccleston an actor i ve always been impressed by since watching his film debut in let him have it and if he was getting interviewed on television it must have been true as the months passed more and more information was leaked billie piper was being cast the daleks would be returning and the mill the hollywood effects company who had done the fx for gladiator were contracted to do the special effects for the show for several weeks before the first broadcast trailers galore heralded the return of the new series massive billboards in london informed the public about the return of the show tabloid newspapers carried massive photo spreads of the aliens appearing and christopher eccleston appeared on programmes as diverse as blue peter mastermind which had a special doctor who night edition this morning and friday night with johnathan ross in fact this new series of doctor who must have been the most hyped programme in the history of british television it had better be bloody good so was it bloody good undoubtedly it has been a major success with nearly every episode making the top ten shows in the tv charts to give you clue of its rating success only one episode the ark in space episode two febuary 1975 from the old series had made it into the top five tv chart the opening series episode made number three with two more episodes either beating or equalling the previous record and this is in an era where there s far more competition in terms of tv stations and choice let s laugh and cheer at the fact doctor who stuffed hit me baby one more time celebrity wrestling and mauled ant and dec s saturday night takeaway of course much of the success is down to the breath taking visuals and the casting of a well known prestigious actor in the role for the most part everything you see on screen here equals anything you ll see in a spielberg hollywood movie there s a dalek invasion force numbering tens of thousands exotic aliens a 19th century cardiff that looks like a 19th century cardiff and night filming that is actually night filming and not done by sticking a dark filter over the screen i promise you ll be hearing a lot more from the directors who worked on this series joe ahearne especially will one day be in the hollywood a list there are some flaws to the new series of doctor who and all of them should be laid at the door of russell t davies it may be contentious whether the soap opera and post modernist elements are successful or not in my opinion they re not but what s not in dispute is that the weakest scripts are all written by rtd as i mentioned in my review of casanova he cheats the audience and he does the same thing here when faced by armed soldiers pointing their guns at him the doctor bellows attack plan delta which makes no sense to anyone in the audience but allows him to escape from a tight spot a naked captain jack suddenly pulls out a laser he s been hiding and rtd scripts are full of these type of cheats and deus ex machina type endings in fact the final episode is spoiled greatly by the ridiculous concept of what the bad wolf is which seems to have got rtd out of a tight spot more than the doctor and of the endings i m trying to remember if any of them were actually down to the doctor more often than it s a supporting character or the doctor s companion who saves the day the show is called doctor who not rose tyler so can we see the title character save the day please just like he did in the classic series one final point about the portrayal of the doctor is the way he s written as a grinning loon eccleston is best known for his serious and gloomy roles and he s absolutely breath taking at scenes when he s showing grief like the tear running down his face in the end of the world but more often than not he s written as a tom baker on speed character it s obvious why eccleston hasn t done much comedy in his career he s not very good at it am i starting to sound like i hate this show sorry i didn t mean to but it s just that while some anticipations have been met or surpassed some others haven t and they re nearly all down to russell t davies who thankfully is contributing less in the way of scripts in the next series of doctor who let s see more traditional stories of a human outpost being under threat from monsters like we saw in the 1960s and 70s imagine a story like the sea devils with a massive budget directed by joe ahearne oh and one last request can we see these next time trailers scrapped they reveal all the best bits of next week s episode,1
1998,having already seen the original jack frost i never thought that jack frost 2 would be as absurd as it is boy was i wrong then again a pix movies have a way of showing unbelievably bad material even worse than you might expect i believe this is the first a pix sequel and it may be an indication of what to expect in the future more a pix sequels it s hard to watch this without laughing especially during the later parts of the movie in which jack frost s offspring which are essentially snowballs with eyes arms a mouth and sharp teeth start killing people with the typical comedic dialogue and silly voices to go with it they are shown both as puppets with a stick underneath to move them and as computer animation which i have to say looks very cheesy the computer animation surprised me as the first jack frost had no such effects i d strongly recommend that you see the original jack frost before seeing this one both of which it would be preferable to watch with a group of friends to get the full amusement out of it and because it would make more sense sense being a relative term now only if there was uncle sam 2,0
18616,misfit recruit private owens tests drill instructor sgt moore s jack webb skills no explosions or bloodshed or hip soundtrack or sex it is set at the usmc s parris island s c boot camp and most of the cast were actual marines memorable one liners abound and the closing credit s dedicated to is intense with such strong male and female characters this movie could not be made in today s touchy feely world,1
13611,make sure you make this delightful comedy part of your holiday season if you admire dennis morgan or barbara stanwyck this film is a fun one to watch they really work well together as you would see in this movie the whole cast was very entertaining since i m a dennis morgan fan this film was a real treat but everyone can enjoy it recommended,1
22223,as you can see i ve submitted 2 comments about this show since 1991 and no itv have still not made it available for general release however i recently contacted itv to see if there was any way of getting hold of a copy and this was their reply unfortunately there are no plans for this programme to be released on dvd video you can however purchase copies from our viewers requests dept their email address is viewers requests itv com hope you all now get the chance to enjoy this classic short comedy again,1
17362,waco rules of engagement does a very good job of not drawing conclusions for its viewers it simply presents interviews footage from the standoff footage of the congressional hearings phone conversations expert testimony etc and allows you to draw your own conclusion i hardly intend to imply that the data presented here was done with 100 objectivity but it is very convincing you won t like koresh any more after you see this than you did before but i tend to think that you will come to believe as i now do there is much that we were not told about what happened before and during the standoff,1
5,i had high hopes for this one until they changed the name to the shepherd border patrol the lamest movie name ever what was wrong with just the shepherd this is a by the numbers action flick that tips its hat at many classic van damme films there is a nice bit of action in a bar which reminded me of hard target and universal soldier but directed with no intensity or flair which is a shame there is one great line about being p ss drunk and carrying a rabbit and some ok action scenes let down by the cheapness of it all a lot of the times the dialogue doesn t match the characters mouth and the stunt men fall down dead a split second before even being shot the end fight is one of the better van damme fights except the director tries to go a bit too john woo and fails also introducing flashbacks which no one really cares about just gets in the way of the action which is the whole point of a van damme film not good not bad just average generic action,0
6937,some good set design good songs though like the other guy said they aren t performed with much energy bea arthur trying her damndest to do something with the material had an occasional good one liner as mame s friend vera and helped move the song bosom buddies along other than that there s nothing here that s worth your time slow pacing incredibly bad cinemetography not very good singing except from robert preston an awful script bad acting except from bea and a horrible lead actress who thought lucille ball would be good as the classy life loving mame the heads over at warner bros were no doubt on crack when they decided to not use angela lansbury who had done it so well on broadway and instead use ball who wasn t nearly as funny by then as she was 20 years earlier couldn t act the part the right way at all and used a painful croak as an excuse for singing even if perhaps because making the movie was painful for her to make and even if she financed it she just isn t mame auntie mame is such a better film and the soundtrack of the broadway musical with lansbury sounds great for the most part there s nothing here that s great engaging or interesting at all forget it unless you re a huge lucy fan who thinks she could do no wrong hopefully after seeing this you ll realize she was only human,0
22789,a three stooges short this one featuring shemp of all those involving shemp i ve seen this is my favorite performance by him in a stooges short the basic plot is that shemp must get married by 6 o clock that very evening if he s to inherit the half a million dollars a rich uncle left him in his will so shemp sets out to get himself a bride but finds it a tougher road than expected that is until they learn of his inheritance money best bits here involve shemp shaving shemp and moe in a telephone booth and larry on piano as accompaniment to shemp s voice training session also the sequence where shemp is mistaken as cousin basil and its outcome proves hilarious,1
11003,i have seen a lot of movies in fact i love b horror movies they are one of my favorite genres however this garbage i refuse to acknowledge that this was given the honor of film was the worst piece of crap i have ever had the torture of watching i actually signed up on imdb purely for the fact that i needed a way to at least voice how awful this garbage was i have watched films they at least deserve the honor done in basements by high school students that were better written and directed i have nothing but pity for the poor actors in this garbage because they were just trying to earn a pay check they will now and forever have this stain on their records like a virgin who was raped and given herpes if writer director john shiban has any dignity left at all after obviously fellating countless people to get this made he should never allow himself near a camera again and try applying his so called gifts to something more suited for him like mopping the floor of a peep show,0
16816,this film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally at the end of the 1960 s decade it was immensely entertaining and provided a contemporary view of the many changes which had occurred during that period and were still ongoing in terms of the black power movement vietnam and the volatile movement which followed the quieter preceding postwar 1950 s all of this and one of the funniest films then or now viewing it for the second time recently i was surprised to find it as engrossing as when seen originally its humor is as funny and its message as strong and in viewing it now you get all of this while at the same time gaining the added enjoyment of its being a period piece and a superb chronicling of its this historic turbulent time,1
17175,especially after watching the matrix reloaded spoilers after seeing the matrix with all it s ridiculous fantasy make believe robotic characters with their super powers it was refreshing to see an action movie with real people in situations that involved actual risk i cared about these people and even though some of the stunts seemed a bit much it still left me feeling like it s possible verses what a stupid video game like the matrix this movie isn t brain surgery it s very straight forward some things are predictable like knowing that someone is going to be a back stabber and that someone early on is going to die pretty obvious but so what the first 15 minutes sets up our reason our motive our main objective i like that theron and walhberg didn t have any make out scenes i am glad that they didn t go there they kept it about funny dialogue especially seth greene that guy is funny this is a movie that i would buy when it comes out on dvd it s fun fast and entertaining the only thing and i guess it s a big thing is that we are really rooting for the bad guys this group of protaganists are already on the wrong side of the law not a good message for the kiddies parents please explain this to them,1
417,i m 35 bruce was the man in evil dead and i still love to watch ed1 and ed2 it was cool also to see him as the king two or three years ago in bubba ho tep in which he showed versatility and great acting talent but this screaming brain adventure is certainly not for bruce s early fans either i m getting too old for this sh17 or i m just not part of bruce s target audience anymore i m positive kids age 9 to 13 will love this film but this over extended matin e sci fi comedy contains about 5 minutes total of interesting moments and the rest is cheap kids slapstick humor campbell better talk seriously with sam raimi and get their brains screaming together for a last evil dead reunion picture to get back my interest at least there would be a good director behind the camera sorry bruce this just doesn t cut it for me take care,0
18690,i actually had seen the last parts of this movie when i was a child thanks to the search feature of plots i was able to find out the name of it for years i did not know the name but the movie stuck in my mind the ending left hope that the main character would get back to earth eventually it was a shame it did not make it to a series this movie reminds me of journey to the far side of the sun also known as doppleganger if you liked this feature the other one is worth a watch it was done before the stranger but shares a similar plot yet different i just picked up the stranger off of ebay on vhs hope they make a dvd but it is doubtful unless it comes out on dollar dvd a few pilots are making it on the budget dvd s and maybe this one will,1
14576,i saw heaven s gate on its opening week nearly twenty years ago tickets were sold in advance based on the great anticipation of seeing cimino s long in the making follow up to his 1978 masterpiece the deerhunter the reviews came in and critics trashed the film with vehemence an influential new york film critic led the way and most critics followed suit and the 3hr 40 min film was pulled from distribution united artists had cimino shorten the film by about an hour and it was re released many months later to equally horrible reviews and to dismal business the film at that time cost about 40 million dollars now considered low budget making it one of the most expensive in history and cimino had free rein on the project with endless retakes despite it being only his third film the deerhunter had also received a negative backlash based on a perceived political ideology which was not popular i mention all this to present a possible bias building up against cimino at the time i thought the film was very good and when i saw the shorter version it was still very good only less so the film showed up again in a museum in the early 1990 s they were supposed to show the long version but they could not find an existing print nevertheless seeing the film years later i now thought heaven s gate was a masterpiece finally the long version started to appear in a few select cities i got to see it recently and it was well worth the wait heaven s gate begins with the graduation ceremony at harvard university two of the graduates are kris kristofferson and john hurt and we some of the flaws in their characters early on despite the mandate joseph cotton gives in his speech to the graduating class to use their education to enlighten and improve their country many of the graduates behave as if they are part of an elite country club the film flashes ahead 20 years to johnson county in wyoming a cattle company called the stockholders association has hired poor people to shoot 125 poor immigrants claiming they are cattle thieves kristofferson sides with the immigrants while john hurt is part of the association although hurt is totally against this insane action he is too ineffectual a character to do anything about it a massacre takes place but the immigrants do well in defending themselves a united states cavalry comes to the rescue of the association to allegedly arrest them after most of the damage has been done when in fact they sanctioned the mass killing kristofferson also suffers a great personal loss and the film ends with him years later as part of the elite class of his harvard days married bored on a yacht living but dead on the inside this is a very complex film which is brilliant in every department such as it s themes structure direction cinematography writing music editing set designs and acting kristofferson walken hurt huppert dourif bridges waterston and cotton are all excellent portraying very complex characters some of the major complaints i read about this film state that is ugly to look at incoherent too long that the characters make no sense and that the words are often unintelligible in its defense heaven s gate has the look of photographs of that period just as mccabe mrs miller did some of the scenes are smoky looking to suggest the industrial revolution or sometimes horses wagons people are passing by from all sides creating a sense of reality the critic who called it one of the ugliest movies ever made likes to use his thumbs a lot but in spite of all that the composition of each frame and the cinematography are impeccable the film makes a great deal of sense if you pay attention to it everything is not spelled out for the viewer and one has to observe closely to understand the motivations of the characters or its themes as to its length it is a beautifully structured piece at times moving poetic exhilarating or devastating with virtually one great scene following another at times some of the words are unintelligible especially in some of the scenes bustling with activity but one could understand such a cinematic film as this through its use of film language the glances between characters or their actions one day soon this film should be re released in its full length so that people and critics could give it a second chance do not let michael cimino become another orson welles under appreciated in his lifetime and not able to make the kinds of great films he is capable of making,1
23581,i would rate this film high on my list of ingrid bergman films ingrid s beauty aside her talent is evident in scene after scene she was sad mean witty snobbish flirtatious delightfully funny loving tender sorrowful distressed happy etc you name it she was all those things and more and soconvincing ingrid plays a notorious woman clio who comes back to neworleans and falls for a texas gambler gary cooper clint i especially loved the scene where they are sitting at the dining table saying nothing just staring at each other she in an elegant white gown and he in a handsome white cowboyoutfit sitting there looking at her adoringly what chemistry what love,1
16342,if i had watched this movie when i hit rock bottom i probably would have sunk into the deepest depression of my life and may have been nearly desperate enough to try it the only thing is in the real world when you rob millions of dollars from unsuspecting individuals everything doesn t come up roses unless you are an investment banker or government affiliated so how does that matter i had been rejected from school after school and it stings so it is a brilliant topic for a movie and when you give yourself over to the imaginary to let yourself watch this movie without applying real world ramifications it can truly touch someone in that situation and let them know they are not alone overdone soliloquy completely tears apart the established educational system as we know it really all i can say is that as i am in college now looking back on where i was and watching this movie i can truly appreciate it in a way i never would have been able to otherwise it is juvenile and contrite yes but it is an emotional and uplifting fantasy about freedom and i cant think of a better way to end my night,1
11488,first i must say that i enjoyed the first underworld movie i was intrigued and curious to learn about vampires and lycans and so forth in this last part hopefully of the series i just feel sorry for how pathetic the vampires are at least in the first part you had the tight leather clothes now vampires seem like besieged victims of bad pest control problem they look and act like haughty white pasty humans some ideas were neat the whole thing with human nobles was interesting pity the acting was abysmal the slave thingy too was feasible other things just hit me as pathetic spoilers now castle walls that can be jumped over in a few steps enemies that don t attack during the day big bad ancient vampires that take ages to join combat and then run away from a fledgling lycan leader after a minute or so werewolves that den close to their enemies lycans that raid armouries for what they don t use axes and swords or armor a vampire leader so inept he manages to have just about everyone against him the romance is so unconvincing its sad so i don t recommend this film unless you get it online or buy a very cheap movie ticket some of the action is good to ok certainly the vampires armor and weapons are interesting otherwise a very weak script that was badly put together and uses all sorts of inane plot twists,0
21888,sherlock holmes basil rathbone and professor moriarty lionel atwill engage in a battle of wits for control of a switz inventor s newest bomb sight creation holmes wants to safeguard it for the british while moriarty isn t above selling out to the nazis while no doubt many fans will be disappointed to see holmes updated to the 1940s war time setting this particular film proves light hearted fun which doesn t wallow in wartime propaganda as it might well have done dennis hoey s inspector lestrade and nigel bruce s dr watson do tend to steal the show as their characters bumbling methods consistently provide delightful comic relief the sparring between holmes and moriraty is colorful and well thought out to boot atwill does well enough as moriarty even if he s not as memorable as some others who played the role while this provides nothing especially new or thrilling for fans of the series it is a wonderful escape from reality somewhat appropriate for 1942 in my opinion that mirrors many movie serial adventures of the 1930s and 1940s but boasts a more compact less repetitive plot and all this is done while still remaining true to the basic spirit of sherlock holmes,1
5449,i just watched congo on dvd in most cases i love these kind of movies but this one is different it made me write my first comment for a movie on imdb i was amazed how such a team of experienced filmmakers could come up with this movie as a result you can see there was a lot of money for this production but you can t make a good movie if you don t have a good script and as a producer frank marshall gave us plenty of great movies to watch he never should have tried to become another spielberg this one shows how hard it is to make a good movie maybe you ve got all the ingredients but if you can t cook stay out of the kitchen if can make a suggestion don t spend your money on this one if you want to see it watch it on television first and make up your own mind,0
22902,this film offers many delights and surprises when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch you share general loewenhielm s exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor babette is an artist whose medium is food perhaps no other art form allows the artist to share her creations so directly the main theme of this movie the potential that the sharing of food has to transform how people see each other and how they see the world is much the same as the theme of chololat but babette s feast does not hit you over the head with its message the townspeople are conservative puritans but not exaggeratedly oppressive you come to understand and respect them and ultimately to appreciate their humanity many issues are raised for you to reflect on the nature of art the contemplation of paths taken and paths not taken the relationship between the spiritual and the physical the effect of environment on behavior the taking of life to give life among others the only disappointment for me was general loewenhielm s speech delivered at the climax of the meal i expected deep heartfelt observations but i got some vague mystical ramblings the speech had such a minimal impact that i hardly remember it but this understated film leaves a lasting impression the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars,1
13589,this is by far one of the best films that india has ever made following are the plus points of the film wonderful direction cinematography and editing the editing is very smooth and the timing of changeovers is excellent even though the film shows the life of mumbai policemen and their hardships it never gets boring or sympathetic mind blowing acting by lead actor nana patekar one can surely hope that he gets nominated for the best actor for the academy awards controlled violence the violence is controlled and the film doesn t become a bloody mess no stupid songs as in usual indian movies,1
14946,the majesty of ramin bahrani s second feature is that like the work of a poet he portrays the very soul of humanity and lets it flourish on the screen beyond the scope of most other indie films out there chop shop is wise exuding the very best of the great cinema of the ages we can look back at the works of bresson and pasolini and compare bahrani s work to theirs and yet chop shop is fresh and urgent to modern society we can see the workings of a master here a certain sense of beauty style and content all merge together in a film that reminds us what it means to be alive instead of focusing on the side of nyc we so often see we live and breathe with our young hero alejandro in the destitute willits point a fascinating quasi sub world of our culture and yet it s a very very real place trying to stay afloat alejandro has to support himself and his older sister watch this film and feel the sense of raw spiritual understanding that bahrani leads us toward all with profound and concise realism,1
3444,pretentious claptrap updating herman melville about a young man s vaguely incestuous relationship with his aristocratic mother getting transferred to his long lost sister who has been raised by gypsies or something like that not that anyone really cares to unravel its multi layered plot decked out with pornographic sex scenes pseudo symbolic imagery the siblings swimming in a river of blood and other bizarre touches a gypsy child repeatedly insults passers by in the street until she is anonymously beaten to death the deafening music of a rock group utilized in the demolition of old buildings considering the source material and the presence of catherine deneuve who at least gets to bathe in the nude i was expecting a lot more from this one apparently there s an even longer tv version of pola x out there,0
15654,what can you say about a short little film filled with secondary actors and no stars with absolutely no bad performances not one poorly delivered line of dialog and with the cold violence on one hand being balanced by the warm heart of the protagonists in the story it s a jewel a diamond a little valuable gem of a western that evokes the spirit and legend of the american west a west not settled by grand heroes like hickock or cody or masterson or earp but by the spread of the everyday man and woman farmers and ranch hands merchants and miners and lumbermen whores and barkeeps and entertainers of the day some looking for riches some for peace and quiet some for religious freedom it is perhaps a very spiritual story though not promoting any particular religion for even the non mormon cowboys portrayed by ben johnson and harry carey jr act in kind and noble ways toward everybody in the story regardless of religious affiliation and beliefs and go out of their way to promote tolerance and charity when the wagon train comes upon the stranded medicine show people and in true biblical fashion like david and goliath or samson and the philistines they are the guardian angels sent to the wagon train who eventually have to go head to head with the evil incarnate clegg clan likening them to the serpent in the garden of eden and regretting what it is they have to do afterward it s a sweet folkloric tale of the west that hits every target john ford takes aim at nowadays i have a western santa claus whose red outfit is covered with a denim drover coat whose red stocking cap is replaced by a brown stetson who carries a burlap bag of presents and a coil of rope to my santa i added a winchester rifle with a sling to put on one of his shoulders and a colt revolver to tuck into his waistband when people at the office ask why my santa has to carry guns i simply reply snakes after all isn t the spirit of the christmas season one where everybody should get what they deserve fifty five years later especially post 911 the philosophies and attributes demonstrated by the characters and story of this movie are still as relevant today as they were back then,1
17610,i originally saw this film while i was working as a musician doing musical theatre in summer stock if you ve ever done any work in theatre especially at a summer stock theatre you ll really enjoy this film yes there are some moments of really bad writing in the film but overall it s a lovely tribute to the theatre and why people love it,1
9273,it s the single unfunniest thing i ever watched it s sad how he tries so hard to come up with a good joke and all he does is curse and thinks his disgusting vulgarity is funny he is the most bitter person i ever saw his whole act he is trying to show how much he doesn t care and by that only showing how much he s angry at the critics and the people with any taste and sense of humor who d rather go through immense torture than go watch his show there are good comedians there are bad ones and there are horrible ones but this guy is in a league of his own i feel sorry for him and even more for the people who find him funny,0

1342,imagine a film the complete opposite of lawrence of arabia instead of having an all male cast it has an all female cast instead of being set in the barren deserts of arabia it is set in the bulging metropolis of new york city and instead of it being one of the greatest films ever made it is one of the most pointless boring and forgettable the film concerns mary haines meg ryan a perfect wife and mother the envy of all others in her high society manhatten social circle she is painted as a women bearing the weight of the world on her shoulders despite the fact she needs a live in nanny and housekeeper to cope with her one child but i don t want to be too hard on her mary does all this whilst taking a liassez faire attitude towards the fashion designing job her father has given her this idyllic lifestyle cannot last forever though and things start to crash in a very real way mary s husband is cheating on her and her father fires her for not working hard enough she is quite naturally upset and breaks down a little mary needs to bounce back though for the sake of her impressionable young daughter and for herself she does this through rehab hair straightening and designing her own line of clothes though amazingly for this kind of film not a montage mary succeeds her daughter loves her her mother loves her her friends love her and her husband decides he loves her now she decides to take her cheating husband back after realising it was her fault he cheated as she didn t dote on him enough the films one saving grace is that it doesn t go down the all men are evil route,0
2814,the discussion has been held a thousand times is the merchant of venice antisemitic i think it is isn t it unfair to always point out this little bit of antisemitism in an otherwise great piece of art i think it isn t does this play stain shakespeare s reputation as the world s greatest playwright i think it does does it play a role if he didn t do it on a particular racist purpose i think it doesn t michael radford knew all this and this is why he added to his movie a prologue about the pitiful situation of the jews in renaissance venice in vain for the play remains what it has always been and the new make up only gives a first but futile hope that someone has dared to set something right that remains a permanent outrage not because its degree of antisemitism would be particularly shocking but because the play comes under the name of william shakespeare why spend so much time in portraying the hatred of a man shylock why employ a great and serious actor like al pacino if in the end everything is getting ruined in this outrageous but hey i m not responsible shakespeare wrote it court room scene and now i d like to be very precise just like shylock himself he s demanding his right according to the contract which the not very responsible christian antonio who always used to look down on him signed in full awareness of the consequences sure what shylock demands is cruel and useless but that s not the point what we see or should see is a man who has been humiliated for all his life to the point where all what remains on him is his hatred i think it is certainly a bit inappropriate to lecture such a man on things like compassion but what the play the movie they are one and the same now does at this point is become a soap opera the cruel madman with his knife the horrified but rather short minded audience the poor victim tied to his chair true antonio accepts his fate but why can t he just say one word sorry i think we need not lose many words on the ridiculous verdict of the young dottore from padua it s a truly popular verdict not much different from what would be seen 400 years later in the show trials of the nazis from one minute to the next this jew is robbed of everything he owned sentenced to being baptized christian and kicked out isn t that outrageous obviously not the story moves on to the romantic intricacies of the rings and its happy end what one can learn in libeskind s jewish museum in berlin and similar places all over the world is that antisemitism often goes unnoticed by the mass because what s so devastating for a minority or some individuals is embedded in the alleged greater good for the majority it should be exactly the task of everyone of us to develop a sensitivity to detect and unmask such tendencies i don t accept the excuse that this film was made to create empathy with the badly treated shylock it just doesn t work out i don t think that anybody can be forced to be merciful i don t recommend this movie in particular not for an oscar,0
3345,mild spoilers with the exception of the terminator and total recall i don t think arnie s action adventure movies are up to much they re better than his comedies for sure but that s hardly saying much the problem i have with his all action blockbusters is that they re overblown and lacking in any sort of morality morality i mentioned in my review of terminator 2 the scene where good guy terminator blows the kneecaps off the swat team are we to think that because the hero maims people doing their job instead of killing them we will admire him in someway this is the problem with eraser when james cann s character is revealed as a traitor within the us marshal department arnie s character john kruger goes on the run with a witness he s protecting but in several later sequences kruger kills a fairly large amount of marshals working with the villain are we take it they were all traitors too surely many of them were honest men who were trying to stop kruger because the bad guy told them kruger was the traitor it s a rather uneasy thought that kruger killed several people who were trying to genuinely up hold the law despite costing one hundred million dollars the special effects aren t all that impressive look at the scene where kruger lets go of the jet wing and scrambles to put on a parachute it s obvious as the action intercuts that it s a stuntman who s doing the free fall sequence while arnie is in a studio in front of a blue screen eraser is also a film that has unnecessary cgi featuring killer alligators not only unnecessary cgi but unconvincing cgi too there s also a few plot holes like in the opening scene involving a couple of witness protection people that the mob has caught up with kruger opens a car trunk and pulls out a couple of bodies and starts a fire thereby throwing the mob of the scent kruger is next seen rearranging the dental records via computer of the couple he s saved it would be logical to do this but would all the couples dental records be kept on computer most importantly of all are we to believe the us marshal department keep a freezer full of bodies for such events so they re you go a typical arnie thriller long on unlikely set pieces and short on intelligence and it s interesting to note that eraser didn t make much of a profit at the box office as the production costs almost outweighed a potential audience figure after eraser arnie didn t do much more business at the box office save for terminator 3 rise of the machines which was an event movie and it ll be interesting to see if he ll be remembered as a politician rather than a movie star,0
7056,help i ve ended up in cinema hell what a completely stupid film this is really nothing is good about it let s spit it out 1 the story is incredibly far fetched an anti eu terrorist group is chasing a bunch of guys who drive around western europe carrying a delivery of see through bags full of xtc pills and the worst thing is they are serious about it 2 the level of acting should put great shame on all faces involved 3 some money eyed guy decided to let every one talk english so that the international market would catch on ugliest advertising ever the french and dutch native tongues talking smart make all but sense and the result is laughable 4 the soundtrack is totally misplaced and ill chosen 5 the camera edit and effects work is supposed to be of some post noir road movie kind of style but is hardly worth some thing and not meant to accompany this story read anti story 6 hidde maas the hero of wildschut never fails to convince a true actor usually i would give an extra point just for the sake of him being around but no sorry not this time i would just not forgive my self,0
2371,a young woman nicknamed t n t for being virtual dynamite in a fight and a knockout in terms of looks to boot goes to the most lawless part of hong kong in search of her missing brother stag jackson when she learns he has been murdered she decides she will bring the killer to justice in a fashion only she can sounds good doesn t it well there s really nothing wrong with the basic premise as a starting base for a martial arts blaxploitation action thriller which is what this aims to be the leads actually prove pretty good too with jeanne bell fitting nicely into the role of t n t and stan shaw doing well as the ambitious power hungry charlie where this fails miserably is in terms of the fighting action it offers up the fight scenes are totally and completely unconvincing and or sometimes so completely over the top it reaches the point of ridiculousness which doesn t at all help when the basic focus of your movie is a kung fu action heroine also the poor lighting actors sporting accents making them hard to understand the confusing camera work and the sometimes poor sound doesn t help this obvious low budget effort out either any this does deliver in one area which may delight some fans it does offer up plenty of the t in t a in fact practically every fight scene in the film is proceeded by some type of nude scene and jeanne bell actually does have one extended fight scene in which she is completely topless in the end this fails to be something you want to revisit because the fight scenes are so pathetically laughingly bad,0
3373,being a science fiction fan from my early childhood long time since i always hated implausible plots it s a pity that most authors of science fiction stories for children do not show this kind of respect for their audience i always suspected them of thinking children are to dumb to realise so we don t have to strive the writer of science fiction 2002 is no exception the story is about a boy who is instigated by his new friends to spy after his parents because they think that the parents are aliens as intriguing the idea sounded to me as much was i bored by its realisation it seemed to me that the filmmakers had exactly this one idea and tried to stretch it over the ninety minutes by dunking it into a dark stylish and painstakingly slow atmosphere the only thing that kept me in my seat was the question how do they manage to get out of this implausible rubbish and then bang they did not even try so if you are looking for good entertainment for both children and parents go and watch klatret sen 2002 instead,0
10488,i just saw this at the castro theatre in san francisco and had trouble staying awake during this incredibly repetitive unenlightening little film it is a 75 minutes film that felt like 175 minutes and has about 20 minutes of modestly engaging material it s not bad in any offensive way it just repeats things that have been said many many times over and more interestingly and provocatively with only a couple of exceptions the interviews drone on and on and on making little emotional contact or context to the whole topic it s more like a how to guide for something that can t be done anymore i was alive during the era but felt little connection or nostalgia for what was presented,0
13067,the muppet movie is an instant classic i remember the opening scene with the bird s eye view of the swamp and kermit starting into in my opinion the most loved song in the history of songs at this point my mom would always sing along with kermit watching this title as a young adult it makes me smile i can still sing along to my heart s desire like many muppet films there are in jokes for adults that are in my opinion still funny today my favorite line of all time is actually from this film it s the last line spoken by my green goggle eyed hero kermit life s like a movie write your own ending that s what i intend to do thank you jim henson,1
3696,ewww a disney sequel that is rubbish who would have thought it actually quite a lot judging by the comments here and they aren t wrong i actually looked forward to seeing this awful film based on my liking of the original and therein lies disney s whole cash in mentality shovel out any old junk on the back of a success and people will go for it don t think they are that cynical ask yourself this then how many disney films have sequels and then how many of those sequels spawn a follow up a significantly lower number kronk s new groove is just another example of this the plot is laughably simplistic and drawn out even more annoying was the increased number of out of place items and scenes an old folks home for example and god forbid an aztec version of the boy scouts worse yet kronk s opposing chippamunk leader has a completely bewildering over the top english accent for no reason whatsoever an accent that was after a very short while intensely grating on the nerves there are a couple of good things the animation is very nice and the voice talent do well with the sub standard dialogue they are given especially warburton in the lead role but other than this there really is nothing to recommend it sure little kids may like it but there is little to amuse mum and dad whilst they sit through this tortuous maiming of the original concept avoid this monstrosity with the same zeal you d use in avoiding a pack of ravening man eating lions,0
4175,i didn t want to write this movie off on the reviews and critics in the western world i mean how wrong have they been about asian cinema that has now become a staple diet of the hollywood remake monster plus jet l is pretty damn cool and he s made some interesting movies in asia so with an open mind i was surprisingly averaged out by this movie there are good points the story is very clever using m theory as a base to bring forward the plot that there are multiple universes each with their own versions of worlds and most likely you each time one of you is destroyed the rest share the energy and power amongst them the idea that someone might try and purposely become the only version of themselves in all the universes to find out if they become a god there s also jet li and he s not a bad actor and pretty nimble as a martial artist plus jason statham who is an all round good actor as for the special effects some of them are really cool a mixing of bullet time and slow motion with normal speed very cool to watch in places the bad points well statham s accent is appalling and some of the effects aren t as comparable as others so it s quite apparent that money was spent on some of the main shots and not on others that were probably deemed as too short on screen or they just plain ran out of budget a big sore point for me is the close cropped camera action that hollywood has long favoured something that jackie chan has often talked about filming fight scenes close up serves two purpose it gives greater emphasis on a single punch or movement making it look harder and more real than it really is and it also hides what is going on around the camera lens for example people holding a fake arm or the face of a stunt double etc what chan always said was that he tried to open out the camera and show the audience what was going on let them see the people fighting properly rather than a close up of a face and a fist cutting to someone falling into frame showing the whole picture is more effective and it s more impressive so the close cropped shots were just more annoying than anything you failed to see the impressiveness of li s fighting skills and you found it hard to see some of the action slow the cuts down and pan out the camera hollywood directors the biggest problem was the story though despite having such a strong base on which to build they seemed to loose the sense of the plot and concentrate on the action scenes there are some serious plot building and explanatory moments that are just totally overlooked and covered in the space of a few sentences yet these could have formed some excellent and complex character development it just all held together too weakly and not enough was made of the story all in all not a great movie and it s potential was badly spoiled,0
1248,may contain spoilers i had very high expectations for this film based on the trailer i knew a bit about the real ed gein so i figured this was a medium budget hollywood version of the real events man was i wrong first the writing apparently came from an eight grader who barely knew anything about ed s history and cranked out the script in about 20 minutes the movie completely passes over the most interesting facets of ed and his relationship with his mother not to mention what the real police found in his house and decides to focus primarily on the young deputy who looks like he just wandered onto the set likewise all of the male characters seem to be ad libbing their dialog throughout the entire movie i m not exaggerating don t even get me started with the historical goofs in this movie seriously who the hell directed this this movie is supposed to take place around 1957 but the cops are carrying modern side handled batons some of the stuff in the hardware store look like they came from lowes and when the cop gets to a payphone he dials 9 1 1 didn t exist back then also ed was a small guy scary like anthony perkins character in psycho who was supposedly based on real life ed not this burly dude who ended up looking way too much like the bad guy in men in black another thing that really bugged me was the appearance that the makers of this film shot the whole thing in an abandoned 3 building set because of the clever camera angles you never see any actual town and the interior of the sets looked like old long abandoned shacks pop a cash register on a saw horse and bam instant hardware store i m usually pretty forgiving of low budget horror films but this one just begs for it all you had to do was include most of the real events even embellish them pay five good actors instead of 15 crappy ones and for pete s sake take 5 minutes and think about the time period once in a while my advice google ed gein you ll be far more entertained,0
2027,bam margera of the jackass fame is back with his own reality show and not only is it not as funny as jackass but it s also amazingly stupider this has to be one of the dumbest shows ever conceived sure there are worse reality shows but none are as mean spirited or as dumb bam margera has made it big and his parents decided to piggy bank off of his fame bam and his parents his uncle his crew of idiotic friends all live together and while bam and his buddies are off breaking things and getting into mischief generally his parents are at home being stupid when bam s parents aren t at home being lazy they re being tortured by bam especially his father to add to the humor we are treated to his fat uncle don vitto who is constantly out of it and never paying attention this show really is like a toned down version of jackass toned down in that there aren t stunts instead bam and his buddies just go break stuff and do lame stunts and meanwhile loud music plays to make it all the more awesome this is not funny in the least i can t imagine a dumber show than this because there is not an ounce of intelligence found here if you are a big fan of bam margera and want to see one of the many follow up cash in sequels to the jackass series my rating out of 30 mins tv14,0
770,i ve never saw the first three but i know they re all better than this trash it s about some kid who throws a party wow sounds amazing sarcasm is it nooo it starts off with a kid laying in bed and he s getting woke up by his mom so the kid pretends to be sick so he doesn t have to go to school he goes to his uncle s house and rounds up some people and throws a party i didn t laugh at all while watching this trash i can t imagine someone sitting down and writing down this dialogue thinking man dis is gunna be big yo makes me wonder if they even had a script for this movie i watched this knowing it would be bad but usually watching a bad movie makes me feel good because it gives me something to make fun of this just disgusted me two thumbs down,0
21924,death bed the bed that eats is a supremely bizarre horror film that truly has to be seen to be believed there is an ancient four poster bed that just loves to eat humans and it does so anytime it can lure anyone to lie upon it there is also a long dead artist imprisoned behind one of his paintings who provides a voice over narration george barry s the first and only one film offers some truly surreal moments such as the bed absorbing its victims in a mysterious sea of yellow foam and liquid the atmosphere is dreamy and there is only a little bit of gore unfortunately the premise is rather silly and the acting is amateurish still as fan of unusual cinema i enjoyed this low budget oddity give it a chance 8 out of 10,1
4033,oh my god it just doesn t get any worse than this i always love silly little sci fi b movies that are so stupid they are funny and i thought that this would be one of those but this was just so stupid i found it absolutely deplorable that it was allowed to be released what were these people thinking they are obviously not real filmmakers and i really hope that they have gone back to their day jobs after realizing that this is the best they could do the acting and the not so special effects were nowhere near the standard of even the lowest budget b movies and what is with the men dressed up as women could they not find any women that wanted to appear in this crappy thing no probably not i would give this a 0 if possible it does not even deserve a 1 for awful do not waste your time and especially not your money on this horrible loser of a non film,0
24715,this movie was a suprise for me while i was surfing from channel to channel i don t know why but it filled in me with warmth and happiness this is what a high budget movie can not do mostly i liked it this is a must see one,1
23460,i just watched this short at the planetout movies starcrossed was a very sweet sad little movie about two brothers that are in love there is some great subtle acting from both the male leads often times movies with this subject matter seem to get too caught up in the controversy and shock value of the plot that they forget that there is an actual story luckily writer director james burkhammer does not do this and instead lets the story play out with honesty the sequences of the two boys first falling in love are very sweet,1
23635,yes fassbinder and ballhaus are at the top of their game back in 1973 it s about the same subject but in my opinion it s a much better movie than the matrix 1999 at least it was 200 times cheaper very nice camera work by michael ballhaus and the wonderful albatross by fleetwood mac at the end fassbinder is creating a very moody tone for the whole film it s a shame this movie was never released on dvd but now after 37 years they finally came to the conclusion that this tv movie is not only one of the best fassbinder films altough there are quiet a lot best fassbinder films it s a brilliant example for a science fiction movie done without much money buy it watch it,1
10314,i went to the cinema to watch a preview of this film without knowing anything about it recognizing jennifer lynch s name and seeing the 18 certificate i realised it might be disturbing in actuality i found the film a farce i found myself giggling in disbelief through parts of it the acting is atrocious bill pullman and his ridiculous twitching face i do almost pity the actors though as the script offers them no chance of any believable character interaction after some shocking incident there is plenty to try and shock the viewer in this film 2 characters are seen sharing a beer and talking about the weather everything was overstated or thought it was being clever when really it was obvious the performance from the little girl character named stephanie was the best thing about the film quiet and intense i really could not recommend this film to anyone its violent without point ridiculous characters bad acting bad script and plain silly,0
9492,i don t know why i even watched this film i think it was because i liked the idea of the scenery and was hoping the film would be as good very boring and pointless,0
15632,wagon master is a very unique film amongst john ford s work mainly because it s the only one that is based on a story written by john ford himself the story that was elaborated by frank nugent and director s son patrick ford and turned into a screenplay and because of director s personal opinion regarding it wagon master is the film john ford called the one which came closest to being what i had wanted to achieve to say so is not to say a little but as ford confessed once to lindsay anderson his favourite was nonetheless my darling clementine and not any other wagon master has all ingredients one might expect to find in a john ford s film wonderful cast delivering his best thou not featuring any major stars except the most fordian of all actors ben johnson very peculiar small characters who provide an obligatory comic relief and wagon master has quite a few of them such as horn blowing sister ledyard jane darwell in her shot but very inspired gigs and last but not least legendary monument valley with john ford s fifth passage through it after stagecoach my darling clementine fort apache and she wore a yellow ribbon the film starts with two friends cowboys travis blue ben johnson and sandy owens harry carey jr being hired to be wagon masters or guides for a caravan of mormon settlers who are headed to silver valley a place that s for them like a promised land on their way they are joined by a very peculiar dr locksley hall alan mowbray with two beautiful women who are supposedly his wife and daughter and who call themselves actors they are headed in the same direction simply because they were recently driven out of the nearest town and have no other place to go nothing particularly unpleasant happens till they bump into cleggs a dangerous family gang consisting of father and his three sons who are on the run from the marshal of the town where they recently committed murder and bank robbery overall wagon master is no more nor less than one more precious pearl in a necklace of john ford s wonderful westerns a must see 9 10,1
21156,while i thought this was a good film about jfk jr it was a little hard to follow the timeline it jumped around quite a bit without ever mentioning what year they were in otherwise not great acting and not really a great film but it was nice to learn a little more about who jfk jr was,1
4164,if i guess your palabra will you let me go through asks william geld a tim robbins that keeps on acting like if they told him a fantastic joke and he is attempting not to laugh he is trying to get to a forbidden area the woman stopping him continues blabbering your palabra is carrefour how did you know the lady asks surprised he answers in the name of wisdom i was hearing when you weren t talking yes this defines the movie this precisely it doesn t matter if carrefour is road conjunction in french or if the future is coldly bureaucratic and mixes languages or if samantha morton has nothing nothing of spanish maria gonzalez being her name in the film with her irish scotish whatever tone it s boring and dull if you fall in believing there are multiple symbolisms you will buy the most bizarre sickening love relationship ever set in a future that may well be in seven seconds i can guess this movie s palabra it will be painful,0
7419,a post apocalyptic warrior goes off to save some kind of nun and on the way meets some cyber punks on skates who want to kick his ass this is one of the hardest to watch films ever there are scenes with silence that seems to last hours before somebody comes out with the next badly written badly acted line there are action sequences that keep repeating and we re not talking the quickfire 1 2 3 action repeat on a particularly good kick that was made popular by eastern directors we re talking many many repeats of long bad fight sequences this is incredibly confusing at first but then quickly becomes annoying as you re watching a 30 second sequence for the 2nd 3rd and 4th time any kind of plot or vision is lost within the confusing continuity the only thing thats keeps this film in the videoplayer apart from the bet from a friend that i couldn t watch it all the way through without begging for it to be turned off and disposed off safely so it may harm no one else is the fact that although painful this film is unintentionally hilarious i m not at all a fan of those so bad that it s funny type of films but at parts i was in tears other points to note are the quality of the sound and picture but this is forgiveable as it s obvious money was a major problem in the making of this film final verdict king of the so bad they re funny genre anybody having that kind of genre video night should get themselves a copy also lets not forget that it is actually the worst film i ve ever seen,0
1542,very slow dull enigmatic film maybe the kind of film jean luc godard would have made had he been italian certainly conveys how tedious repetitious joyless and empty a person s life can be but i don t usually go to the cinema to find that out the plot such as it is doesn t convince why a gorgeous hotel receptionist an exception to the dullness of the film would be the slightest bit interested in a moody chain smoking silent loner who speaks in deep aphorisms baffles me very difficult to feel any sympathy with the main character one feels like shaking him by the throat and telling him to snap out of it his brother is a much more human character the ending is inconclusive and puzzling everyone in the cinema when i saw the film went out muttering about how they nearly fell asleep of course it shouldn t have to be a hollywood bruce willis style shhot em up and crash bang fiesta but a little bit of energy and action would have made it a lot more thrilling one of the best italian films ever pleease an art house curiosity at best,0
11096,it seems that some viewers assume that the only thing which can make the viewer dislike this movie is the graphic violence in fact violence both disturbing and cartoonish is the last of oldboy s deep flaws the characters are unidimensional underdeveloped primitive the intensity an obsession and a goal in itself with this director is served up with the cheapest of means let s not confuse a mindless shot of adrenaline with artistic worth by the end of the movie it seems that all the cards were exhausted so the script becomes almost inadvertently funny in its efforts to find new levels of horror to continue to shock an audience which is already numbed by the plethora of dumb soap opera revelations already served up in big bunches it would be hard to imagine anybody even vaguely familiar with the masterpieces of the last fifty years of asian cinema being enthralled by this pompous piece of trash imagine homer simpson hesitating in front of the cinema theater should i go in or should i buy five cones of ice cream for the same money be smart homer go for the ice cream,0
9086,a gaggle of unpleasant city dwellers descend on le touquet for a week s holiday stories intertwine characters fight make friends deceive each other have sex blanc has gathered together a stellar cast for his adaptation of connolly s book but to little avail what should be hilarious is instead at turns tedious and irritating all the characters are either pathetic or unpleasant or both and in the end despite the farcical nature of things this viewer was left caring little about what happens to any of them credit to the always wonderful rampling plus bouquet and viard but that s it and dutronc looks like he s rather overdone the nips and tucks if you ask me,0
16397,i ve heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that paris hilton was in it as well didn t give me the best impression of the film then to be dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and sit there expecting a pile of pants i was shocked to find that i was scared stiff all the way through the film it was predictable yes but the build up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the film made it really scary for me i was watching through my fingers the whole way through so i say go watch it and decide for yourself and if the fact that its a scary film doesn t convince you to go watch it then it also has chad michael murray in it which can t be bad to watch for a couple of hours eh,1
13845,i grew up in new york and this show came on when i was four years old i had half day kindergarten and this was on wpix channel 11 in the afternoon i just loved the music and stories and remember humming them around the house when playing i just saw part of an episode on youtube and for a moment i could remember how it felt watching those shows as a small child i of course stopped watching when i got in 1st grade because it was on before school got out no vcr s or dvr s back then i grew up not realizing that the show was still on until i was in 11th grade i also had no idea that there are dvd s and wish my nieces and nephews were young enough to enjoy this show but now they re all past the demographic or i d buy all of them dvd sets this was so much better than a lot of the kid shows today,1
9925,if you thought day after tomorrow was implausible wait till you see this okay so the premise of most disaster films is usually a 1 in billion event occurring compounded by other circumstances in this case the even is the joining of two huge storm systems fair enough so far oh but hold up no the event is the sabotage and subsequent destruction of the power grid next throw in loads of human interest elements in this case a cheating husband a psychotic gun wielding boyfriend a rebellious daughter a hacker with a point to prove a senator trying to push an agenda a reporter trying to stand up against the man and a pregnant women stuck in an elevator finally add a handful of taster events to add excitement jeez if the director tried to fit in any more meaningless plot lines there would have been no time less for the actual disaster which given the pitiful state of the computer graphics was almost certainly the intention jeez if you can t even model a truck convincingly you really should not be taking on twisters exploding power stations las vegas getting ripped apart or destroyed oil stations in case you didn t already gather how appalling this movie is let me just add that all three bad guys get killed in separate and wholly ungratifying implausible manners that stunk more of moralising that good film making i m have no problem with first month film students writing jaded hackneyed clich soaked scripts but for god s sake that doesn t mean anyone has to make them into movies it manages to make the abysmally implausible 10 0 apocalypse look not quite so dreadful avoid them both,0
2511,i ve seen every episode and the characters have all remained the same self absorbed whinny little brats thought out there s no character development in 5 years getting pregnant is not development if your still the same daddies girl only now delinda whines to danny because dad isn t around sam never changes or grows which makes her boring repetitive and just so annoying its sickening after season 3 danny is a typical soft character that gets ordered about by everyone in his life he has no principals morals of his own especially mary and delinda the old boring clich will they wont they on and off relationship does get boring very fast indeed james cann can act and his character is ok to watch only he is just another hack writers wet dream an ex cia man that has huge contacts and training etc so he can stop any thief or cheater known to man even though the cameras cant do half the stuff they make out its fun for a while however in 5 years the writers act very dumb why because they have all this expensive and advanced technology but no simple walkie talkie communicating is fast and easy you never see security walking the floor only when there s a situation and suddenly everyone is just there the plots very quickly move from the cheating and robbing the casino in one way or another to awful typical american boy girl relation ships the same done to death material seen all over the world they have sex but i hate you i ve always loved you i think i do but i love her him instead but what if maybe one day blah blah blah i d recommend hotel babylon to people who like las vegas it has so much more going for it simply because the characters are interesting engaging and not forced down our throat for 6 months of the year i m glad to be british i d rather see the same actors in 5 different shows rather than 5 years consistently getting worst in the same one,0
12197,i chose to watch this film because i am a stephen nichols fan unfortunately i am unhappy with mr nichols choice to do this movie the film was slow badly acted and included some very graphic sex scenes of mr nichols character with a very young woman watch at your own peril,0
14453,rock star is not on its way to any stairway to heaven category as one of the best rock films of all time but it does make you jump from time to time because of its high level energy the film s theme is on a die hard rock group fanatic who actually becomes the lead singer of his favorite band the story is based upon the true story on what happened to the heavy metal band judas priest if you think this movie is filled with a witty screenplay and intellect direction then you got another thing coming however what did shook me all night long was the fine acting of jennifer aniston as the rock star s devoted girlfriend i could not say the same about the rock star himself mark wahlberg was much better as a porn star than a rock star i did enjoy the 80 s retrospect journey the movie intakes it reminded me of my teenage years where everything smelled like teen spirit i guess the film is worth a viewing but for you to have a better time watching it make sure you bring along some girls girls girls average,1
24707,i was completely drawn into the story but i wonder if perhaps i shouldn t have been so sympathetic to the hurt character s plight for respect because when it boils down i really think that glam reporters such as barbara walters is the devil or maybe the filmmakers were telling us that we re all unknowing supporters of fluff news stories,1
15969,this film is one to spend the short while entertainment but who then could be made in nobody country it does not have anything identifies the colombian who looks for the topics of the supposed colombian or socially and politically correct cinema and what it is denominated it jeopardize it is better than it is not going to see this film some to the drug traffic or the fight is no reference either farmer and worker or wing guerrilla and to the kidnapping political the corrupt police is a personage who it could be mexican russian italian or chinese and also the personage protagonist an argentine photographer it could be venezuelan peruvian or philippine and the frequent boludo in its parliaments it could be replaced by another word of slang of any other country without the personage or history changes the important thing is that it is a very decently counted history with images and right performances its quality almost is of tv movie but of the good ones that if one film like this if it deserves or does not deserve the support with publics bottoms a little is a classic discussion mamerta,1
10901,this is the worst film i ve seen in a looooong time it reminded me of a cirque du soleil show i saw in vegas six years ago without the athleticisme by that i mean a few striking artsy images appear randomly without any sustaining framework the fake sepia tinted film is really tacky this device is almost never justified and certainly is not in tuvalu with apologies to abe lincoln you can fool some of the people some of the time,0
18222,i loved this film a must see for any rod steiger fan producer suzanne delaurentiis and director stewart raffill have brought us a true family film that touches the soul an incredibly well put together movie with a beautiful soundtrack,1
20531,once you sit down to see this film a cannon for cordoba you get the feeling it s going to be a great the reason the film begins with a rousing score by noted composer elmer bernstein who gave us such memorable themes as the great escape and the magnificent seven indeed when you read the opening credits headlining the cast is none other than george peppard as capt rod douglas you know it s going to have action and lot s of it furthermore when you see actor john russel playing general john j pershing you know you re in for a heroic saga the story is taken from the annals of the mexican revolution and involves the u s in a border town dispute with the mexican bandits who cross the rio grande in the early 1900s among the most brazen of the rebel leaders is general cordova raf vallone with his army of mexican revolutionaries he attacks pershing kills his men and steals some valuable artillery pieces since the united states army cannot enter mexico legally capt douglas is sent on what is slated a suicide mission without orders and without aid from pershing his mission is to retrieve the cannons destroy a rebel stronghold and bring cordova back alive selecting the roughest toughest most experienced certainly the most insolent men available douglas enters mexico and attacks the nearly impregnable fortress dramatic action follows as does lots of explosive excitement if one is asks for criticism i would say the choice of heavies vallone and john larch are not very menacing not so with the men who side with peppard pete duel and don gordon who is superb nevertheless this movie is recommended as good viewing,1
5051,having spent the six years previous writing and producing luc besson returns to the directors chair with angel a i m a huge fan of l on and quite liked the prospect of a black and white french film from the same chap andr is a liar and gambling addict owing money to almost every loan shark in paris unable to repay his debts and fed up with being held over the edge of the eiffel tower he decides to kill himself he happens to do so at the same time as a mysterious woman who he decides to save determined to thank him she begins to help him fix his own life the film starts with some laughs which run well throughout the visuals are quite nice and work well with the sights of paris but that is it that s all the film has got going for it and these mere two facets can do nothing to hold back the torrent of terrible film making the movie unleashes though i can t hugely fault the main character his inconsistencies are close though the eponymous one is ghastly a terrible screen presence and bitterly annoying the plot is ridiculously inconsistent itself and at times bizarrely silly particularly the ending an ending which completely bloodied the fledgling redemption engendered by the scenes immediately prior to it perhaps the most ridiculous scene i ve had the ignominy of observing it is stupid indulgent melodramatic and considerably too awful to be so bad it s funny the overall premise of the film could conceivably have once held potential but it is brutally massacred by the unendingly terrible implementation of its ideas the film really was a task to watch and one which had me screaming at the screen the whole way through massively and immeasurably flawed angel a is just plain bad though its occasionally fun dialogue manages to draw out chortles at rare intervals by the end it is clear that this film is nothing more than repugnant,0
8691,another lame attempt to make a movie gritty and thought provoking whatever the hell that means they have al pacino say a lot of words like television killed football yeah whatever this is another movie that showcases oliver stone s delusions of grandeur if stone is trying to show us that football will be our downfall or something why does he insist on romanticizing the sport with his stilted camera movements and kid rock songs he even throws cameron diaz into the fray for purely aesthetic reasons it s a shame that diaz and pacino have to meet in a movie that is so bad ever since scent of woman writers and directors have used pacino to romanticize their pathetic lines his characters are nothing more than loudspeakers their voices covering up what would normally be redundant and trite he needs to reinvent himself showing how he can act without yelling he has to stop feeling sorry for hokey scripts with cheesy lessons like organized football is messed up and act out a good story,0
16254,in this era when almost everything makes it on to dvd i m expecting to see the my mother the car collection any day now this film has been unfairly neglected there are innumerable stupid comedies from the 60 s as well as many other eras that have received at least a cursory dvd treatment this one wasn t even released on vhs to my knowledge despite the talents involved in the making arthur hiller eli wallach anne jackson murray shisgal notable later for co writing tootsie even dustin hoffman in his debut it s obviously a product of the sixties but so is just about everything else from that era all films reflect the tastes and customs of the times in which they are made this was released the same year as the president s analyst another absurd masterpiece that film was finally released on dvd and has developed a cult following this film has many memorable bizarre goofy wacky moments sure it s painted in broad strokes and has silly go go music throughout but that s part of its charm it creates its own absurd universe if whoever is in charge of dvd production for columbia pictures releases i believe columbia released it takes polls for new releases this gets my vote,1
14396,i just love this film it totally rocks nicolas cage looks hot and tommy does not i definitely feel that fred and randy should have had a little more time together on screen cause they re totally cool my favorite part is when he says peter piper picked a pepper i guess i did,1
10674,this movie stunk there is not much more to it the final fight looked like walker taking on my grandmother not some supernatural demon with the strength of ten men i found the commercials more interesting the plot twists and jokes could be seen coming a mile away the only redeeming quality of this film was that it ended avoid this at all costs unless you enjoy bad chuck norris movies,0
17979,before barton jumps all over my remarks let s all just keep in mind that opinions are like asses we all have them i loved sigourney weaver jeff daniels i loved the dialogue and thought the acting was sublime downplayed just perfectly and understated unlike some others i did not find this all predictable i found sigourney s role refreshingly humorous and realistic especially her scene confronting the bully in the trailer i found it enjoyable and wasn t anticipating recommending this to all and sundry this is why there are different flavors of ice cream something to please everyone,1
13221,this one is a hilarious diamond in the rough the acting and plot aren t that impressive but the lines just keep on coming this catches a lot of flack because it seems at first glance like well a bad movie but it s so kooky that you can t help but be amused the spastic lightening quick dialog and quirky characters keep it going i was especially fond of sharon the canuck on shrooms eh however the one that really stole the show was richard s little brother andrew ira heiden his high pitched whining was somehow endearing the whole movie rocked,1
19158,found a copy in a bargain bin sale of this old time classic i played it with dosbox on a vista machine without any issues it s graphically dated heavily but what do you expect for a 12 year old game the game is a fps adventure game hybrid it s what i call pseudo 3d you can t look up or down just spin in 360 think wolf3d game play can get tricky with a very limited supply of health pots and a somewhat average interface tip press i but on the whole it s passable one main strength of the game is the mood there game heavily uses full motion video and whilst the acting is b grade and the plot is very choppy the game as a whole feels genuinely creepy it also does a good job of making you question the good guys are they really helping or are they just waiting to stab you in the back the other major selling point is the games length there are from memory 18 chapters which range in game play time from 10minutes to potentially hours my first play through took me a week with some serious devotion of time dated yes but if you missed this years ago and can find it for 5 give it a look cheaper than a movie and more entertaining than most movies,1
19183,words alone cannot describe the sheer beauty and power of this film think toy story now think toy story circa 1934 now imagine the animation looks as lifelike as fluid think of the movie not as something adults and children can enjoy but imagine it as a filme noire imagine trying to do something like that back in 1934 somehow the mascot delivers in a story where toys come to life and one of them is trying to deliver an orange to his sick owner starewicz delivers a level of animation completely unexpected it s so fluid you will wonder for a long time whether what you see is really stop motion animation comparing toy story and the mascot is an excercise in futility plot wise while toy story is a children s story adults can enjoy the mascot is a dark chilling story aimed at adults meaning no your kids won t like it one bit still get it if you can you might be able to find it along vampyr in dvd and laserdisc and prepare to be stunned at what starewicz was able to do back in 1934 with a couple of puppets,1
23839,dirty war is absolutely one of the best political government and well written t v drama s in the 25 years the acting is superb the writing is spectacular diry war reveals the true side of why we are not ready to respond to a nuclear biological and radiological terrorist attack here on american soil dirty war should be made into a major motion picture it s that good i highly recommend this great drama to everyone who desire to know the truth this t v drama reveals how british intelligence mi5 mi6 attempt to expose a terrorist plot and conspiracy to destroy innocent victims because of england s involvement in the iraq war the scenes of different parts of london england are also spectacular dirty war is a must see,1
8150,poor bela lugosi just another day at work a group of saboteurs attempting to disrupt the american war effort from the inside it s pretty hard to figure out at first because while we know these guys are up to something their method of operation just isn t very clear i won t spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing there are a series of murders perpetrated by our hero a police force that doesn t know what is going on what a coincidence that all the victims seem to come and go from the same house there are comments like a true patriot would do this or that it s obvious while suspicion abounds most of the world wouldn t know a spy or a subversive if it jumped up and bit them i also was surprised to see clayton moore the lone ranger in a romantic role i never realized that he ever did anything other than sit on a horse there is of course the smugness of the criminals as they think that they are immune from the killer s guest list anyway bela is sort of a good guy and a bad guy rolled into one the best scene in the movie is at the end but i won t spoil it as a curiosity and a period piece it may be fun to watch for some people,0
19559,this is a wonderful movie it s funny dark poignant thought provoking innocently naughty and generally entertaining all around i don t know that i ve seen the like before the rapture or maybe one of todd solondz s black as night comedies or even the recent movie teeth come to mind but those are all bitter nasty little gems franklins despite the darkness around the edges manages to have a thoroughly sincere and pure heart the story is similar to john waters low down dirty shame only this film differs in that it actually has a story and something to say as well beyond waters juvenile sex isn t dirty snicker nudge nudge message a conservative repressed family undergoes a drastic change as a result of a car accident and suddenly aren t so conservative anymore in fact they re finally actually happy probably the only people in their town or maybe the entire world who are to talk about why this is the case would be to spoil the film simply put everyone should see it though of course only people who are already sold on what the movie s upbeat hopeful philosophy is ever would the acting is great just this side of realistic enough to keep the proceedings from getting too heavy teresa willis gives an especially memorable and brave performance as an uptight mother who emerges like a butterfly when she s freed up both she and robertson dean deserve kudos for their unflinchingly sincere performances not to mention frequent and extensive nudity and sex scenes they turn what could have been a salacious joke involving a deviant sex practice into a touching believable and endearing moment aviva as the daughter is a standout and someone to watch perfectly capturing the attitude angst and speech patterns of a girl her age vince pavia as the himbo brother with a secret is good looking and functional although his storyline and how everyone reacts to it is more rewarding than his actual acting mari blackwell as the conflicted best friend to mother franklin is wonderfully cold confused and even compassionate in a role that could have gone over the top technically the film looks fantastic all bright colors and wide open locales it looks like it may have been shot hi def if so the line has gotten very thin it looks very much like film there is a great deal of talking and a lot of it philosophical which gets a bit preachy moreso i d imagine to a viewer who disagrees with the film s politics but this film says a lot of things that need saying if only people wouldn t be afraid to listen and think the arguments that take place are smart and well thought out first and foremost refusing to demonize either the religious or non religious parties the ending is on the ambiguous side which i found a bit of a disappointment somehow i think it would ve worked better had the author as jay floyd is since he produced wrote and directed given a more workable denouement some sort of solution but then again there probably isn t one when it comes to pitting people with different faiths against one another all the same it was a moving memorable final image that left me choked up a success meanwhile i m awfully glad mr floyd got this film made and look forward to sharing it with as many people as possible check it out,1
16978,the questions and answers of the human spirit are all here in this masterfully crafted historical documentary the shear beauty and horror of one mans walk through life are revealed in totality dieter and herzog are combined and connected through a mental maze that has been transformed into a single straight hallway which the walls have been plastered with images created by one mans characterization of himself by the vibrations of his own vocal chords this film for about 80 minutes have discovered a new dimension of storytelling what do i call this apparently new sense only god knows after all isn t a miracle something that god does for us but chooses to remain anonymous this is a requirement to see if you like to experience the lovely horror of war this documentary will cleanse your soul to the marrow,1
6514,this is the most stupid movie ever made the story is laughable his wife and kid think he s insane then they don t then it turns out he is and i think they knew it all along there is a dog named ned that causes some problems and i think it s all his fault so does jim carey god only knows why virginia madsen took this role this is a career sinker i think the target audience for this is 11 and 12 year olds and that adds up to 23 or maybe it s for 8 and 10 years olds which also adds up to 23 or maybe it s for really dumb 23 year olds or maybe really dumb 32 year olds because that s 23 in reverse or maybe 46 year olds would enjoy it because half of that is 23 i think looking up things on the internet about the number 23 would be more entertaining than this movie unless you wanted to see a comedy,0
6588,this is absolutely the worst movie i have ever seen i hope the real family and other portrayed characters have lawyers suing the hell out of vh1 for there portrayal the acting is horrible the writing is worse and the portrayal of characters is scary its supposed to be a drama but it was a comedy to me you have no choice but to laugh at the bad acting i usually like flex alexanders acting but this time he has completely missed the mark you could argue he took this role for a couple of laughs himself because it was so horrible if you really want a dramatic movie for the night do not choose this one but if you are in for some laughs over bad acting and stupid writing tune in other than that don t waste your time,0
15780,before i start my review here is a quick lesson in australian slang which may help you with viewing the movie and understanding some of the other reviews from australia and overseas in australian slang thongs are a pair of rubber sandals not to be confused with the same american word that pertains to butt revealing underwear stubbies are a brand of australian short a stubby is a small can sized bottle of beer and a stubby holder is a foam insulator for a small bottle of beer if you love black comedies about smalltime criminals then you will love this movie unfortunatley a lot of people on imdb with weak stomachs and no appreciation of dark humour have reviewed this movie which unfortunately makes this movie appear to be more mediocre than what it is a lot of reviewers have also compared it to lock stock and pulp fiction while it is the same genre it is a completely different and original style a lot of reviewers have also panned this movie for using heath ledger s characters dead brother to open and guide the narrative for this movie without watching the movie closely enough to realise that his brother was killed by the same villain that wishes to kill heaths character this is explained midway through the movie but not clearly enough for most to understand this movie is also reminiscent of lock stock and reservoir dogs in that it is the director writers debut feature and for a debut feature it rates as well as these two movies as a matter of fact like lock stock and reservoir dogs i rate this movie as a 10 10 for a director writers debut unfortunately unlike tarantino and ritchie jordan fails to live up to expectations in his subsequent movies like ned kelly this movie is one that you should definitely add to your dvd collection and is one that holds up to several viewings quite easily,1
19132,to be honest i thought this movie would be a japanese drama i was dead wrong this movie is based of the popular japanese anime novel of the same name it tells the story of a town that is cursed by the uzumaki or the spiral in english little by little the towns residents start to slowly become dangerously and violently obsessed with anything to do with spirals and some of the residents start to actually turn into living things the actually have some sort of spiral within them such as a snail the movie was one giant random acid trip twisted with romance and drama sort of like a twisted drama what makes this movie disturbing is the ways that some of the people are obsessed with the spiral for example one of the dads has a garage full of house hold objects with spirals incorporated into them one girl took her extremely long hair and teased to an insanely huge spiral like style one kid slowly transformed into a human snail one man could twist his body into a spiral shape one woman attempted to cut her ear open to obtain the cochlea inside and one teen ran over himself so that he could be twisted around a car tire and one kid stuffed himself into a washer so he could become a spiral another very disturbing aspect of this very well syndicated is the atmospheric tone and the style in which this movie was shot the camera angles add to the psychotic and twisted story in other words a very good cinematography the overall coloring of this picture makes for a somewhat demented story the coloring is a blend of lime green yellow and a little orange and the special effects with some of the spirals are outstanding however like many japanese films this one has an undertone of forbidden love and romance between a girl and a boy however with all the spirals and strange happening going on in the town it is hard to keep up with the relationship of the two teens but in some way it is very irrelevant more like a second hand story that has nothing to do with the actual story of the spiral obsessed town overall i would recommend this film to anybody who likes vastly different and bizarre foreign films it has just enough wackiness and insanity it touched me,1
11375,i gave this 2 stars out of a possible 10 i went into this not realizing what it was and discovered it is apparently some kind of african musical since people break into song every few minutes none of the songs rhyme most of them aren t really saying anything sensible and they all have the same non existent tune if you could call it a tune karmen is a tall spectacularly built young woman with the longest braids i ve ever seen the actress looks as if she has probably done some modeling the film opens in a women s prison although not like any prison i ve ever seen or heard of the inmates wear whatever they wish and seem to be having a party karmen does some frantic dancing and the woman warden of the prison angelique a magnificently handsome woman is definitely erotically interested she and karmen dance together later karmen visits the warden s room and they make love unfortunately the scene is not detailed and is very short although there is some nudity karmen then escapes from the prison and next we see her dancing in front of another group where a man named lamine maybe a colonel it was never really clear who he was watches her he is with a young woman who dislikes karmen s seductive dancing and there is a dance off between the two women after that the story such as it is becomes even more muddled with lamine in jail out of jail and who knows where karmen may be involved with a group of smugglers or thieves there is more singing more dancing and a scene of angelique obviously suffering from heartbreak the film muddles its way to a finish and i heaved a sigh of relief that it had ended,0
13381,i only heard about driving lessons through the itv adverts and to be honest i didn t know how much i would like it i switched on the tv last night and was totally surprised driving lessons is a modest simple film which draws you in right from the start rupert grint plays the part of socially awkward teenager ben brilliantly he s definitely one to look out for in the future dame eve walton is played by the fabulous julie walters i loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity the highlight of the film for me was evie s rather colourful poem it shows how friendships can form between the most unlikely pairs in my opinion watching driving lessons is a great way to spend 2 hours the scenery was also striking especially the countryside anyone who can call this sparkling comedy forgettable i strongly disagree with,1
23856,review is of the original 1950 s version not the restored 1980 s one in a land where the king likes no one and no one likes the king a shepherdess and a chimney sweep from two nearby paintings come to life and run off a portrait of the king who loves the shepherdess kills the real king and takes his place a huge bird the wonderbird of the title acts as a hero of sorts and helps out our two lovers this is a strange strange movie no surreal very very very surreal the style of the background is very european while the characters are fliescher meet warner but early arty warner of the non major characters they move in both realistic and cartoon like manners this is an odd movie and it takes a bit to get into it but peter ustinov as the bird is a riot his kids and the puppy are wonderful there are cops in rubber ducks and a bear design that makes you smile and there is deep philosophy in the film about the existence of a world out there out beyond a metropolis subterranean city this is a really neat movie there is something just so odd and unique about it that rewards you if you stay with it for the whole ride its not perfect but what the hell this is a movie to search out if your local bargain dvd bin has the capcom version paired with alice in paris buy it it should run you under ten bucks probably around five and the price is absolutely worth it especially when you realize it comes with two full length cartoons two short cartoons and several neat commercials and other fun things,1
9111,one of the worst movies ever made let s start with the superficial joaquin phoenix is first of all too fat to be a rookie fireman the nyfd does not recruit pillsbury dough boys john travolta has a bad dye job and the strange gleam in his eye throughout the movie made me think that he was on some sort of extended scientology bender the plot hits on all the tropes and clich s of what the average joe believes life as a firefighter is really like they all get drunk get into fights have a hard time expressing their emotions their wives all stay at home crying they all have father issues everyone has a boston accent et cetera an execrable piece of schwarmerei that plays on our lingering cultural hero worship of firefighters after 9 11 which was by the way valid cultural hero worship this film unfortunately presents no believable heroes to worship,0
10969,cujo is a movie adaptation of a novel of the same name written by stephen king i ve never read the novel but just scanning the comments page has given me some insight i noticed a reference to the change in the ending the plot of the movie is as follows a st bernard dog gets bitten by a rabid bat and goes on a killing spree the plot sounds quite worn now having been done in various movies however it might have been something new when king wrote the novel or perhaps king s novel put a twist on the story that was never shown in the movie anyway the first 40 minutes of this movie have nothing at all worth mentioning other than the dog being bitten nothing else happens nothing scary nothing funny nothing to add depth to the characters and nothing interesting in any other respect i found this section difficult to sit through and was constantly shouting at the tv come on get started the events that i was seeing on the screen were reminiscent of a tv movie of the drama genre or an extended episode of a tv soap opera unfortunately there was only one family in the movie given any focus so it couldn t even work on a soap opera level the dog was the best character in the movie but it didn t get enough screen time in this section there was nothing to indicate why this dog would go on a killing spree later after the 40 minute mark point something finally happened the dog suddenly transformed from a lovable pet into a vicious killing machine it began attacking some people there was also an interesting cat and mouse chase when two characters became trapped in a car unable to leave because the dog would attack them even in this overly long second half the suspense would build up well before dying again it was just a stop go situation repeated over and over again until the movie reached its conclusion without giving the ending away i can tell you it was very formulaic and unworthy of a stephen king story the suspense scenes when they are on the screen are exciting to watch some great camera angles add menace to the dog s vicious nature when he attacks people this is particularly important because as others have mentioned a st bernard dog is nowhere near as scary as say a rottweiler unfortunately the movie fails to utilise suspenseful music to support the images on the screen the music is far too melodramatic rather than suspenseful this may fit a tv movie but it looks incredibly out of place in what should be a dark toned movie presenting a living nightmare to the viewer this brings me on to a wider problem with this movie the photography the camera work and especially the choice of colours make this seem like a very cheap tv movie one would expect to see as the daytime movie on channel 5 here in the uk where i am writing this comment from the top two actors deliver good acting performances that help to breathe life into the movie s dull segments dee wallace and danny pintauro should be given credit for doing a great job with the poor material they are given i could forgive a few brief moments of overacting by paying closer attention to the dialogue which could not have allowed any other interpretation in my opinion i won t pass judgement on the other actors because they are given virtually nothing to do as someone who is a fan of salem s lot and stephen king s it both movie adaptations of famous stephen king novels i had high expectations for this movie but it turned out to be a massive disappointment overall i do not recommend fans of stephen king or horror movies in general to watch cujo this is one of those moments where i have to recommend the book rather than the movie hopefully it brings the story to life in a way that the movie failed to do,0
18939,sometimes it s hard to define what separates a successful delightful comedy from one that falls flat in this case the contrived plot about a spoiled rich girl who schemes to take her nieces away from the greenwich village bohemian who is raising them only to fall for him herself is not promising and nothing in director leigh jason s filmography suggests that he was an overlooked major talent and yet he must have been responsible for creating a relaxed happy atmosphere on the set that was faithfully recorded on film he also had the good sense to cast this movie properly the one small flaw is miriam hopkins in a part that ginger rogers would have been perfect for hopkins is efficient but brittle lacking the warmth and sexiness rogers would have had she is further hampered by a pair of bizarrely long and sooty false eyelashes that are sometimes a distraction but a very young and very handsome ray milland couldn t be better in an exuberant uninhibited comic performance of great charm and better than that particularly for new york city residents is the hollywood depiction of greenwich village in 1937 though completely synthetic and idealized it remains recognizable to a contemporary viewer art director van nest polglase created an amiable jumble of mews apartments and ramshackle shared backyards that is the perfect backdrop for this picture s collection of artists strivers smart alecks and wannabes best in the supporting cast is guinn williams bringing sweetness and light to his role as a prizefighter sculptor dressmaker suggesting the self invention and fluidity sexual and otherwise of life in the village even more refreshing are betty philson and marianna strelby playing the little girls plain intelligent and full of humor these girls seem like real human beings and are nothing like the professional child actors of the time of special interest are a couple of memorable comic set pieces ray milland s vacuum cleaner demonstration to a woman with a howling baby is played with more spontaneity than one expects the baby and his contortions are marvelous found moments and a phony domestic play in a department store window that degenerates into a free for all is also fun the movie slides slowly downhill with a straight faced custody trial and then never quite gets back on track when the action moves to long island but this movie is still worth a look,1
4777,the other lowest rating reviewers have summed up this sewage so perfectly there seems little to add i must stress that i ve only had the cockney filth imposed on me during visits from my children who insist on watching the sunday omnibus my god it s depressing like all soaps it consists entirely of totally unlikeable characters being unpleasant to each other but it s ten times as bad as the next worst one could be the reviewer who mocked the true to life bilge spouted by its defenders was spot on if anyone lived in a social environment like this they d slash their wrists within days and i can assure anyone not familiar with the real east end that it s rather more ethnically enriched than you ll ever see here take my advice avoid this nadir of the british tv industry it is evil,0
11394,when i saw this movie three years ago i thought it exemplified a lot of the traits found in singapore art house movies slow moving with a minimal of plot and dialogue depending on film composition to make it work during then amongst local cineastes the inability to appreciate be with me is tantamount to panning citizen kane or any of ozu s late films i ve no idea how be with me reached such hallowed heights in singapore s cinematic consciousness but i always felt that khoo s 12 storeys is a better film even though the latter film does not boast as good a cinematographer as adrian tan khoo s dp for be with me 12 storeys has a story that better relates to most singaporeans and has bite too something that be with me s threadbare wistfulness doesn t have be with me is basically a barely interlinked trio of narratives strung together into a film by khoo and his screenwriter wong kim hoh it deals with a security guard who falls in love with a girl whom he only sees in the distance two girls in a horoerotic relationship and the story of deaf and blind teresa chan be with me is very well filmed by tan using a varicam camera the film compositions are masterful the film almost entirely silent has next to no dialogue characters move around not in a realistic manner but almost as if they are models under the instruction of a director almost always looking into the screen and emoting either loneliness or sadness unfortunately the characters don t act against each other this kind of film has been seen before many times in tsai ming liang s films in khoo s prot g royston tan s 4 30 and elsewhere sadly its ultra slowness essentially plot less and use of a lento piano soundtrack simply doesn t appeal to me to criticize be with me seems almost to negate the inspirational story behind it that of teresa chan who is blind and deaf and yet lives a fulfilling life despite all this yet i m afraid this film doesn t do anything much to me i m willing to applaud chan s steadfast and courageous march in life and tan s striking cinematography but for a better take on the same subject matter with more meat without the two other tedious and distracting subplots try werner herzog s land of silence and darkness 1971,0
6949,i rarely shut a movie off after the first 10 minutes but that is what i did with this one what turned me off was it was so obvious that the only purpose of this movie was to expose as much skin of as many b actresses as possible and nothing else really matters don t get me wrong i like pretty actresses and sex scenes and sexploitation movies have their own scale of merits but this director does nothing else right for example take the scene where the two cops of course one guy one gal and of course there is all this supposedly witty banter between them are talking over while standing over the first dead body the camera pans between them for each line there s more than one screen width between them and you end up wondering whether you re seasick from that or the clueless dialog well it might have gotten better after the first 10 minutes but i wouldn t know i declined the sucker bet and found something better to do,0
24476,what can i say about this movie except that it is great fun john cusack plays hoops mccann a recent high school graduate who has two choices learn to take up the family business of street sweeping or spend the summer at nantucket with his pal george calamari played hilariously by joel murray and his zany friends when i say zany believe me it can t get much zanier than the stork brothers egg bobcat goldthwait and clay tom villard and ack ack raymond curtis armstrong throw in a little girl named squid and her weirdo mutt and a great performance by demi moore and you have the makings of a split your sides laughing movie the laughs flow freely in this movie and the story line though the typical good versus bad and good conquers is great with the twist of a regatta as the showdown i would recommend this movie for anyone who likes loads of laughs and a feel good time if you like to thoroughly enjoy your movies then you can t miss one crazy summer,1
1687,a poorly paced sf horror venture that takes itself much too seriously memorable only for a the beautiful mathilda may wandering around naked through the chaos and b terrible miscasting it has a few mildly gruesome effects and startling moments and some unintentionally funny scenes but is mostly a waste of time,0
21794,i became a fan of the tv series homicide life on the street late in the show s run but became a fan very quickly it was a cop show unlike any other visually different in its use of hand held cameras taking the viewer everywhere with its multiethnic and mutiracial cast and their varying and fascinating personalities and that it covered all of the good and bad of a police department including the corruption and personality clashes that bubble up to the surface homicide the movie the reunion follow up to the series is as good as a made for television film can be after lt giardello yaphet kotto now a candidate for mayor of baltimore is shot the series cast members are back to help find the killer in addition the cast members who left the force and those who died also manage to have their place in the film the intensity and fire that marked the series return and the script bristles with the same fire that marked the series all in all a terrific tv movie vote 9,1
23543,set in the 1970s los angeles christopher boyce has just dropped out of seminary school and returned back home were his father gets him a job where he monitors intelligence documents his old friend daulton lee is a ratty cock drug dealer and gets caught in a set up and must choose between becoming a narc or facing a long stint in prison when up on bail he jumps and heads to mexico city chris offers lee in a partnership to be his messenger to sell secret papers to the soviet union embassy in mexico city because of the disgrace he feels about the us government s control over weaker countries to their own gain but over time the two begin to clash with their motivations and find themselves in something bigger then they had originally intended director john schlesinger has spun out such films like the respectable midnight cowboy marathon man sunday bloody sunday and day of the locust while the falcon and the snowman might not be held up that high there s no question that this sombre espionage drama inspired by a true incident is an unjustly overlooked character portrait everything about it is quite a subdued affair with no real grandeur qualities hitting a massive mark the driving factor of the film has got to be the admirably versatile lead performances of timothy hutton and sean penn as the two ambitious young lads chris and daulton penn is especially good with his uneasy intensity which works well off hutton s superbly cool and collected turn what starts off as easy we watch the situation gradually crumble as the two amateurs find themselves really out of their league the strongly detailed and symbolic predatory behaviour plot mainly centres on the pair s relationship and that of their reasoning s for their actions which eventually shows us the knotty developments that led to their downfall the plan opens up like a wound to never properly heal due to daulton s drug addiction which really makes him go off the rails and leaves chris to pick up all the slack the searing political aspect is there but it focus on the themes of idealism boyce and greed lee to get its point across both don t mix and results show suspense is justified through its stimulating pot boiling script and character interactions then that of any visual gimmicks action is very little but still there s a pressure induced style to schlesinger s assured and realistically dark n gritty direction pacing is mostly well handled although some sequences do seem to wallow on for too long but however it grips you as it plays on its authentically paranoid tone to slowly build up to an exploding tight latter end adeptly fleshed into the technical production is an airily harrowing music score and professionally poignant cinematography the supporting cast are exceptionally fine with pat hingle lori singer david suchet boris leskin jerry hardin and joyce van patten also look out for michael ironside in a tiny part as a fbi agent a mostly outstanding spy film that benefits largely from talented lead performances and by not playing the usual stakes it s more an emotional ride then a complex one of twists recommended,1
16105,but a great cast jonathan pryce kathy bates rupert everett lynne redgrave julie andrews and dan aykroyd and that s just the beginning i m not totally sure that any description of the movie and plot are going to entice you to watch this one suffice it to say that it has something for practically everyone death singing a sparkly suit cell phones a little person nice looking woman actually a drawbridge modern not medieval a boombox and a crossbow oh and a psychotic and barry manilow you will have to trust me when i say that 50 of you out there will hate this movie because of the lack of the absurd gene in your dna makeup it s not your fault it s hereditary the other 50 of you will probably want to change the channel after 20 minutes but you have to keep watching even at that at the end you may wonder why you watched but keep in mind that absurdity thing it should grow on you it is a test,1
7858,this is one of the rare movies that i did not immediately discuss with my friends after watching it this wasn t because it had particularly entranced or impressed me the contrary it had given me nothing at all why because somehow everything was so much overdone that i couldn t take this film seriously anymore there was so much sex and violence that i got the strong impression that the film was trying very very hard to be offensive as if it was aiming at superlatives in ugliness rather than in telling a convincing tale about two women caught in a spiral of crime baise moi had been described as thelma louise with actual sex to me well it is true that the main idea is similar there are two women traveling through the country because they ve committed crimes and know that their lives are finished now that the police are going to catch them and they decide that now that everything s over anyway there is no way to hold back baise moi had been described as a feminist film where women who had suffered from male dominance in the past exact revenge upon the men that they encounter this is something that i had never interpreted into this film simply because none of these women had ever been innocent and because they do not just kill irresponsible violent men but also men that they seduce themselves men that show the sense of wanting to do protected sex and they kill women no they are in no way better than the characters that they encounter and murder in hideous brutal ways how easily the heroines decide to murder and how much pleasure they take in it made it absolutely impossible for me to relate to them in any way or even take them seriously it was just all too much too much sex too much violence i got the feeling that sex and violence were only there in order to create a superlative in ugliness rather than in conveying a story or making a point baise moi left me with no impression hadn t set me thinking because it was so far removed from any real world so constructed unrealistic and over the top there was nothing that i could do with this film there was simply nothing about it to think about other than why did they make this terrible film had the intense unpleasantness going on in this film served a purpose i d easily accepted it but since i found nothing since the film s story appeared to be not more than an excuse to squeeze as much and as ugly sex as possible into one film i filed it away under unnecessary torture decided to never ever ever watch this film again and i now consider this to be the worst film i ve ever seen worst not just because it really isn t my cup of tea to watch people get raped rape have sex in other forms and kill one another but because whatever it was that the makers wanted to tell the world with their film if they wanted to say anything at all it just didn t work and there s nothing else that could save this film because it s also filmed in such an ugly style,0
6331,it is sad to have to say that a film is truly awful and one tries to find ways around saying this however this is a dreadful film gene hackman wastes time and one suspects many dollars on re playing his most famous and oft recreated role as gene hackman otherwise television actors are given the chance to become film stars and successfully resist the temptation patrick swayze has a minor part and went on to greater things for which he must be eternally thankful i watched this film as a result of someone else s review and i felt that another point of view was merited you may not agree with my review but now at least you have been warned,0
13179,i saw the movie while i was in a class a few years back in high school i thought it was a thought provoking movie that made you want to look into the power behind riddles i think the type of people that wouldn t like this movie would be those who don t like solving things or those who get frustrated when they can t solve riddles its a good movie based on a true story that happened in my home town of toronto ontario so if u want a real record of the things that happen in the alleys there watch this movie and for those who only watch movies to point out plot holes and character flaws realize that in real life this same stuff does happen but thats all i want to say on that the riddles are good some are hard some are not but the movie also leaves you wanting more more riddles more explanation just plainly more something more i want to add is that the ideas within this movie the underground riddle world does exist but there is a lot more to it to find it you can not look for it to never look for it would be no way to find it leave your mark and it will find you,1
8662,there s a good story well hidden and never really used the film is short and overly dependent on action and thematic photography somehow character and story development have been forgotten what is left is muddled and superficial turn off your brain and watch you will probably find that the time goes quickly enough but unless you are the sort of person that finds soaps deep and meaningful you are going to get no real satisfaction from this film watch only if you have nothing better to do and then only if someone else pays for the video rental,0
6873,i am sitting here watching the film tango and cash it led to a discussion about other great late 80s movies the ridiculous tunrer and hooch k9 connection came up granted i have never seen k9pi and if i still value my life i never will joshua quotes this as his movie of the year wow wow i am utterly astonished that this movie exists but so much more than that the fact that joshua likes this move disturbs me to the core i think joshua is one interesting guy k9k9,0
10867,back in college i studied marketing and even though i missed a whole lot of classes and never really paid any attention i will always remember the main and most essential principle of marketing namely it s not what you sell it s how you sell it this principle fully applies to the devil s triangle as it s basically a beautifully wrapped and enticing yet empty package writer director richard winer knew exactly that he had to divert the viewer s attention away from the major inaccuracies so he threw in some elements that never fail when it comes to providing a creepy atmosphere like the sinister voice of narrator vincent price and the oddball music of king crimson and i m guessing richard winer s dirty little tricks worked very efficiently as there was a huge bermuda triangle hype going on during the mid 70 s and literally every movie production whether it was an inaccurate documentary or a sleazy exploitation flick covering the topic earned big money at the box office the devil s triangle overwhelms you with data that is unstructured and often irrelevant but the severe dramatization of the facts and of course the intimidating stark voice of the almighty vincent price generates an ambiance of fright and creepiness the narration constantly jumps back and forward in time and covers a massive amount of strange occurrences and mysterious vanishings of ships and airplanes in the bermuda triangle throughout a period of nearly one whole century but the reports remain extremely vague at all times and the eloquent mr price invariably ends every chapter with the sinister words just another unsolved mystery of the devil s triangle after a couple of cases the whole formula simply becomes laughable and almost pathetic but i guess it caused genuine mass hysteria back in 1974 the documentary expands a little more on the most notorious bermuda triangle mysteries like the five planes of military flight 19 that inexplicably disappeared all at once and the peculiar case of the vessel uss cyclops but still even in these chapters only a minimum of serviceable information is given the cameras never at one point go underwater to explore the depths of the bermuda area for example and the testimonies of the supposedly real life witnesses of the dramas suspiciously look like staged acting scenes if you re looking for an informative and objective documentary on the bermuda triangle i certainly wouldn t recommend this movie but in case you want to sit back and listen to vincent price s hypnotizing voice for nearly a full hour this is your chance,0
14868,a lot of alternative comedy in britain in the 1980s was insular misguided overly political and unfunny and the worst of the comic strip presents stuff fell into this category but this is at the other end a remarkable film that works on different intellectual levels is dennis a criminal mastermind or is he lying is he telling the truth bluffing double bluffing counter doubly bubbly bluffingwhatever i ve probably watched supergrass 20 or 30 times and i still can t decide 100 that s the wonderful thing as well as ade edmonson there are big roles for other early comic strip mainstays french saunders pete richardson alexei sayle keith allen nigel planer and robbie coltrane though curiously enough not rik mayall all of the comic strip cast however much i disliked the hidden agenda of some of their members are convincing actors and turn in superb performances in this big screen outing while the richardson richens writing team s work is so often pure genius with nice little touches of detail throughout ultimately this is a study of crime criminology and human nature in all it s wondrous complexity and very funny with it you will not be disappointed,1
2082,i cannot get over how awful this movie was my eyes want to jump out of my head and my ears are gushing blood from the horrible awful one song soundtrack there are four kids and dog and they run away from a hospital then get away with stealing two cars and a bus no one gives them any punishment or anything to correct them the acting is just so awful it sounds like an instruction video for social studies class i cannot think of one thing that i like about this movie nothing even the kid that loses his dog made me want to vomit he gets his dog back without the lady even seeing the dog run out the door maybe the dog was trying to escape out of this movie then there is some horse manure in the whole mix it was torture watching this movie then at the end the oldest boy says something like staying together isn t a crime and they all hug him and love him stealing gas is a crime stealing two cars and a bus is a crime and he should have went to juvenile hall or something avoid this movie at all costs and especially if you want to keep your family together,0
20753,please why not put this fantastic film on dvd i have been searching just like the previous writer for years whats the hold up or show it on tv its so underestimated its one of the most romantic and beautifully written books i have ever read and believe i have read some i seem to think it was read on radio 4 but i can t find that either why not try and remake it even i promise it will be top earner people love those sorts of stories so please either release it and take us out of our misery or remake it although i doubt if it could be improved upon has any one read gone to earth by the same author or seen the film with jennifer jones this is superb but not to the same extent may be,1
13273,with all due respect to joel fabiani and rosemary nicolls and their characters department s will be forever associated with peter wyngarde s jason king most people remember him as this camp flamboyant and debonair womaniser cum detective in the mould of austin powers but that will do a disservice to the character he s far more nuanced than that jason king is lazy he often lets stewart fight all the bad guys and only chips in at the end he is egotistical his appreciation of people is based on whether they ve read his novels or not a lot of his detective work is speculation without facts to back them up and he sulks whenever annabelle is right and she often is he s clearly a man having a mid life crisis and drink drives but jason king is brilliant if wyngarde had played him purely as a dashing hero it wouldn t have worked but he shows king often as a paper tiger led by his libido love of finery and prone to grandstanding and it gets in the way of his detective work at times but he has some of the best lines and put downs in tv history and by not playing him as whiter than white the chemistry and interactions between the three lead characters is all the better for it watching it again on dvd recently you get to see just how much depth wyngarde put into jason king,1
94,sorry but jacqueline hyde get it jack l and hyde jekyll hyde has some of the worst acting this side of hardcore porn not to mention a script apparently written by a first grader with undiagnosed learning disabilities jackie hyde inherits an old mansion by a grandfather she never knew she had guess who yes an inventor of the special formula that slowly takes over one s body and mind yes that mr hyde despite some nice skin scenes this film fails to register any feeling or emotion other than uncontrollable laughter as much as poor jackie tries she just can t stay away from granddaddy s special formula and the result is an hour and half of wasted time,0
21222,i have a completely biased point of view mainly because i live and enjoy the club culture lifestyle being a dj and frequent club goer i see the honesty within this movie and i love it if you don t know the club rave culture then it will be a great foray into that culture for anyone that doesn t know it first hand the honest portrayal of human emotion and issues in the part of jip i loved the characters were well constructed and i thoroughly enjoyed this film i really don t enjoy the fact that you have to write ten lines on this web site i will write at least 6 or 7 but i feel that i can portray my point with fewer than ten here are some extra lines to make the imdb gods happy,1
16409,a slight case of murder is an excellent tv movie which is defiantly worth the price of a rental william h macy is great as a movie critic who accidentally kills his mistress and then has to try to conceal the crime although that may sound dark the film is actually quite light hearted and funny with many memorable lines acting is harder than i thought you ever see body heat i think i owe bill hurt an apology and my personal favourite for next week answer these two questions about film noir what do these people do during the day and why is it always raining the film has a great supporting cast including macy s real life wife felcity huffman james cromwell and adam arkin a must see for macy fans,1
17219,2 37 is an intense and fascinating drama which has some similarities in tone and subject with films like bully elephant and kids although by my point of view 2 37 is a superior film to those three ones before watching this movie my expectations were neutral but i ended up taking a very good impression thanks to the intelligent screenplay murali k thalluri s perfect direction and the excellent performances from a group of young actors the sporadic instances of school violence around the world have inspired many movies tv programmes and books which pretend to find and predict the external or internal reasons of those unbridled expressions of rebelliousness discontent and specially madness some people may say that 2 37 arrives too late to that artistic movement however i do not think like that because that delay permitted the movie to make a more artistic analysis focusing on the situation with more subtleness and intelligence instead of the obvious reaction of cruelty and anguish which impregnated other movies with similar stories on the characters from 2 37 we can find clich s from the juvenile cinema from director and screenwriter john hughes rip s movies to the teen horror films the beautiful princess the clumsy nerd the antipathetic athletes etc it would have been very easy to make them become in hollow caricatures defined by their function in the screenplay but it is something admirable that the screenplay transcends the stereotypes to make them real people with credible problems which in more or less degree any person can find on his her road to maturity 2 37 is an excellent movie whose only fail is that the ending feels a bit affected but which compensates that with a lot of positive elements it will be very interesting to see thalluri s next projects since he has had a great debut with this movie,1
16973,this film stands as one of the most amazing examples of compelling and artful film making i ve every seen herzog seems to capture the almost transcendent tragedy and beauty of dieter s story as well as his endearing personal character by the end of the film i was left wishing that i d had the opportunity to meet dieter before his passing on a technical note the cinematography is intimate and astoundingly beautiful the narrative is intricately woven with great awareness of the subject and his capacity for reliving and reenacting traumatic events few documentary directors have so strong an ability to so thoroughly invest the audience in the character this film is a must see,1
11383,in this film there is a loose plot of a man bardem who wishes to obtain financing for his construction business and marries a woman he does not love the wide eyed maria de medieros in the process he maintains his passionate relationship with his first and true love and ultimately gets entangled in his own romantic web he never gives up his juggling act until the three main characters come face to face the film results boring with lots of free sex well both girls are really good all the reactions in the film are absurd incoherent and of course too much stupid none of the characters are believable which makes the movie a little annoying anyway the acting is surprisingly good for such a bad directed film which makes it a little interesting but if you can watch another film please,0
2747,i saw the mst3k version of this film and it is a bad movie but its not nearly as bad as its low imdb rating currently 1 8 out of 10 at least the movie has a few production values and it apparently had a competent editor unlike the movies that truly are awful the primary problem with this movie is that it had no appealing characters whatsoever the main character marv is so pathetically morose that he practically asks for all the bad stuff that happens to him and he isn t very smart either or he would have figured out to stay away from the conniving girl betty and even more pathetic than marv is his father who is nothing but a drunken loser the highlight of the film is the heist sequence at the end but even that is so weakly executed any excitement it might have added to the film is completely missing at least this movie made for a very funny mst3k episode as mike and the bots do a great job making fun of it,0
13588,satya was excellent company was just as good but more polished probably owing to the money earned from previous movies ab tak chappan however is even more entertaining the dialogue is gritty crude and at times hilarious nana pataker shines yet again in a role that only he can fulfill with authority but the supporting cast are very talented direction is tight and the story evolves at a satisfying pace with a very dramtic climax as a depiction of reality it may be over dramatised but at the end of the day it s a movie so the balance is spot on i ve ordered my dvd and can t wait to see it again at home as a lover of these type of gangster flicks this is very gratifying and comes highly recommended for the refreshingly non yash raj bollywood gangster flick lovers out there,1
23223,the photography and editing of the movie is exceptional for the time period eisenstein builds upon each scene of the movie leading to the the sailor s revolt and the massacre at the town as much as the movie is a high point in the cinema it is also an example of szocialist realism by 1925 the soviet government actively used the arts including film as a means to spread the message of the revolution eisensteins portrayal of the revolt on the battleship potempkin offers the viewer insight into the message of the soviet elite marxist theory and perspectives of class struggle are demonstrated as the sailors who represent the oppressed workers and the officers who represent the elite of society much of the film demonstrates the communist party message and how film was used as a tool of propaganda,1
6677,i once heard this movie described as either you ll love it or you ll hate it from reading some of the other reviews and the ratings i would venture to say that this is true i am placing myself in the hate it crowd i have seen some truly bad movies boring movies and even low budget movies this movie is bad on all three fronts this island earth s exeter jeff morrow returns to his sci fi b movie roots as dr les minus giant head prosthetic the doctor and his assistant arnie george o hanlon aka the voice of george jetson along with les girlfriend assistant vera are tracking a meteor this is the crux of the cast and is almost a double date les has vera and arnie has his susie synchro unifying sinometric integrating equitensor aka the computer lets just say the relationship between george and his robotic maid rosie and his relationship with susie is more believable than the cold clam like feelings vera has for les and vice versa the object of their all their interest is no ordinary meteor however it is really an alien art nouveau art deco energy storage device which moves around like a 3 legged dog there is also the little alien energy being that controls dr hubbel aka the chief scientist there the alien is obviously and from the get go malicious and evil is this the kind of science we are handing out no wonder the aliens from the explorers were afraid of us from watching some of these movies we shoot first there s no need for questions afterwards the whole movie is synonymous with watching some really boring science experiments like boiling an egg or adding food color to celery its not the fact that this is a low budget sci fi movie or thats its a bit cheesy and outdated it is really really really boring the whole movie is about trying to figure out what is going on that is it most of the things we learn about what s going on are through monologues and self dictation now add crappy dialog cardboard acting and cheap sets and you have the makings of an ed wood clone by the way ed has made some really boring movies as well please avoid the orgy of the dead the dialog oh the dialog jems such as from under 2 miles of ocean why not it came through a billion miles in space or do you think you ll be able to respect a husband who s probably pulled the scientific boner of all time this movie is obviously trying to pull a forbidden planet this island earth magnetic monster or in the same light as the outer limits twilight zone namely a low budget sci fi movie or tv episode that is compelling enough to get past the technical difficulties and strange situations at the core these movies are enjoyable on some level the story the underlying meaning or the sheer comical nature of the dialog or situations this movie has none of that it is just 90 minutes of boredom i couldn t even enjoy this on a ed wood level i definitely recommend skipping this one and seeing one of the movies i mentioned above instead it is so bad that if my name was dr forrester i would never think of showing this movie to anyone except frank maybe,0
8865,harlan banks is thief at the top of his game but after a successful career he has decided to settle down with his woman and retire however he decides to take one last routine job in las vegas all he has to do is drive the car and it seems simple unfortunately someone tips the police and after a hectic car chase he winds up in the slam only to escape and take revenge on those who betrayed and got him there in the first place a typical action fest ensues steven seagal plays himself surprise wearing a trench coat and sporting his beloved colt 1911 along with his usual bone breaking aikido the colt and aikido have always been with him but the first i recall him with the trench coat is in the foreigner it isn t particularly impressive but it does add a little notch to seagal s lethal arsenal of badassness or it covers up those extra pounds he is packing look at it however way you choose his main buddy throughout the film is played by treach another new thing a rapper in an action movie and they both uncover a little conspiracy of bad guys on both sides of the law and give each evil doer his due the film s main problem is that is it painfully and i truly mean painfully unoriginal seagal just follows a clockwork plot throughout the movie and even that manages to get more and more dull as the film progresses then it goes from dull to utterly ridiculous in the final scene as people who seemed to be dead on killing each other suddenly for no reason start to talk groan inducing in every sense of the word the only real positive thing here is the decent opening a car chase in las vegas complete with flipping police cars and generally entertaining mayhem but after that brief highlight you ve seen it all before 3 10rated r constant violence and profanity,0
5536,ok if you are looking for a fun lesbian romp this is not the movie if you are looking for a fun movie with hot sociopathic characters in the vane of cruel intentions or wild things this is not the movie if you are looking for a classic vampire lesbian seductress s movie this is not the movie however if you are looking to wast an hour of your life this is your movie it is badly written badly directed badly scored badly filmed it had bad special effects i mean really bad special effects i think that you can actually generate the same special effects in imovie lol it really is a pretty bad movie the actors were classic starlet beauties however look more like porn stars it is shot like a soft core porn however you never get the money shot and the actors all look bored out of their brains the girl on girl scenes which suck btw were so lame that there hardly worth mentioning go watch the almost sex scenes on youtube cos that s the only reason you would want to watch this movie and even there not worth it a wast of money and time don t even pick it up go watch cruel intentions 2 instead same movie without the bad special effects bad storyline bad writing bad dialog and bad acting actually i might go watch it now just to purge my mind,0
6898,this was an abysmal show in short it was about this kid called doug who guilt tripped a lot seriously he could feel guilty over killing a fly then feeling guilty over feeling guilty for killing the fly and so forth the animation was grating and unpleasant and the jokes cheap it aired here in sweden as a part of the disney time show and i remember liking it some what but then i turned 13 i never got why some of the characters were green and purple too what was up with that truly a horrible show appareantly it spawned a movie which i ve never seen but i don t have any great expectations for that one either,0
13113,susan sarandon she made this movie for me i ve never appreciated her acting more than as i did in this movie she really acted as though she were adele august i can appreciate actors and actresses who leave their individual persona and create a character who s truly believable natalie portman as ann august helped create the ideal antagonist as their characters developed through the movie the movie was about them so the other characters were peripheral i gave this movie an eight rating but susan received a ten from me because of her performance as far as relationship movies go beaches and terms of endearment had a greater impact on me than this movie but i highly recommend it,1
9348,the lines in the title of this review are the first lines in this film s theme song a wonderfully demented parody of the in my opinion horrible song my favorite things from the sound of music and this fun little detail isn t the only aspect that makes the body shop aka doctor gore 1973 recommendable to my fellow gore trash fans the film which was created almost entirely by j g patterson jr who served as producer writer director and leading man as the eponymous dr gore is crap no doubt but it is also beyond doubt that it is amusing and that everyone involved probably patterson especially was aware that they were not exactly making a masterpiece dr brandon patterson a famous but totally insane plastic surgeon looses his beloved wife anitra a model in an accident along with his hunchbacked assistant greg roy mehaffey he henceforth kidnaps beautiful young women in order to build himself a new perfect wife out of their body parts doctor gore is doubtlessly a film of the so bad it s good kind but it is also has qualities beyond the usual ridiculous trashiness mad science has always been one of my absolute favorite horror topics and as a matter of fact it is also one of the coolest topics for ridiculous gore trash flicks obviously shot on a minimal budget doctor gore pays some homage to the frankenstein films especially james whale s masterpiece bride of frankenstein 1935 and resembles the look of the early troma herschell gordon lewis gore flicks such as blood feast 1963 only that this looks a lot cheaper and crappier obviously j g patterson s motive was not merely to make a fun gore flick being a rather ugly weird looking fellow his role of dr brandon gave patterson the opportunity to make out with a couple of hot scarcely dressed young women who would later end up as body part donors in dr brandon s laboratory most of the gore is actually pretty well made regarding the obviously tiny budget the dialogue includes some extremely hilarious lines get that it might be the door and put a coat on so they don t see you re a hunchback besides the aforementioned theme song doctor gore also includes a wonderfully crappy appearance by a country band called bill hicks and the rainbows my new favorite band not for the rest of the film i kept wondering whether bill hicks and roy mehaffey who plays the hunchbacked assistant are twins or even the same person the two look exactly the same and having two unrelated obese red bearded guys looking this weird in one film would be a huge coincidence other than j g patterson most of the cast members never did any other films this is the first film i ve seen out of the few by patterson sadly the man died of cancer in 1975 overall doctor gore is a film that certainly isn t for everyone as a matter of fact it is total crap but it is also amusing and recommendable to my fellow fans of weirdness and cheap camp stuff dictionaries should show a screenshot from this film under trash flick,0
24308,this movie is never going to be on a list of the top 50 films of all time but if you re compiling a list of fun films this isn t a bad place to start liv tyler is amazing captivating and luscious and everyone else is dead on right for their parts it s a 21st century counterpart to tom jones in other words just good bawdy fun i think that this may be tyler s breakthrough film on her way to major stardom with no nudity she oozes sex in this film it s no wonder all the boys give her toys how could they help but do that for a helpless innocent such as liv s jewel,1
5486,like many this dung heap caught my eye while i was channel surfing it s a horror film set in the woods it has a stupid title but hey michael rooker is in it and he has been a part of some great horror flicks i know he wouldn t steer me wrong ugh the most insulting part of this is that i actually watched it i see director johnny martin is a stuntman well this stunt simply sucks and how he got some of the actors to do this watery bowel movement is the biggest mystery of all i can understand casper van dien but shame on you mr rooker your good name in the horror community has been forever tarnished and your agent should be fired immediately i m sure this nugget of fecal matter is available on dvd but if you enjoy the 99 cent menu at mcdonalds you d get more for your money there,0
13271,like night stalker and then x files the show set up a fantastic situation and the main characters had to sort it out unlike these the hero es weren t left holding an empty bag at the end they had usually tangible results it was also made clear that the good guys were in a dirty profession where they occasionally had to pull some nasty things imagination wit acting which didn t always take itself too seriously i miss it one reason being i m hard pressed to think of too many shows banacek aside which did as good a job of taking the viewer and grabbing their attention right off the bat the writers excelled at setting up hugely improbable if not downright impossible situations which the characters then had to find an explanation to explanations which often took 90 degree turns into the clearly unexpected yet for all that still made sense too i agree with another reviewer that the anabelle character was somewhat underused but when she was on screen it wasn t just for eye candy she was quite competent in her own right and stood up to the two male leads when she felt the point she was making warranted it a rarity in those days sullivan if he wasn t in the department he d be working for the kgb or cia he s that sort of coldly efficient ruthless type he knows how the world works and realizes what it can take to get the job done king it s clearly a game to him one he excels at and which he parleys into ideas for the detective spy novels he writes as his ostensible real job he s probably the most fun to watch of the three although they all have their moments and often too i do agree that the eventual spin off series featuring only his character lacked the interest of the original however,1
19582,there are few films that have had me waiting and waiting for release more than this one this is the latest film from the dead gentlemen group responsible for the original gamers film and the demon hunters films this group has not been terribly active over the last few years but this film is a definite reason to try and keep things up in following their progress this film follows a group of gamers who are trying to finish a campaign run by a gm frustrated by his group s disregard for his story with the help of some new blood they attempt the campaign again with hopes of finishing this time this movie is a breath of fresh air in the movie community and a great improvement over the original the movie shows respect for the game much like the original movie did but on top of that this movie shows a dramatic improvement on special effects launching it above the simplicity of college films the acting is fairly decent and the jokes are quite funny unfortunately many of the jokes are in jokes so if you are not a gamer you may not find the film as funny as others so this is why i give the movie an 8 instead of the 9 that i initially thought of any case if you are a gamer or know about gaming check this one out you will enjoy it,1
16813,certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time excellent original music clever heady it s hard to be articulate about something this good there isn t one character that you don t instantly love to watch myronex putney there s trouble in the black room my name is rufus the lines thrown away left and right are classics themselves recalling slapshot caddyshack anchorman repoman dolemite any comedy whose dialog is not of the formulaic set up punchline variety putney myronex called you tasteless my organization is pro integration where s lopez he s in my head they don t sound brilliant until you hear them in the context of the scene this movie will eat your brain it s too good i ve read reviews calling this film racist which couldn t be farther from the truth every scene is gold from the etherial cereal commercial to the brothers in the black room meeting to that haunting trumpet in the closing scene one word genius,1
8717,i have to give this movie a 4 because of a couple of things 1 what i ll call the stupid victim syndrome if you have the killer on the floor and you have his gun shoot him please if you are a cop and you have your shotgun pointed at the killer s back shoot him please 2 when you are in a high stress situation and you have your finger on the trigger of a gun your first instinct is to squeeze this is one of the first things they teach you in handgun training and the reason that you don t put your finger on the trigger until you are ready to fire ask any hunter or infantryman if you are electrocuted your muscles should also contract making you squeeze your finger 3 it s really hard to lay on the floor completely still for 8 hours without 2 other people one of them a doctor not noticing that you aren t dead even more so if you are supposedly dying of a brain tumor and were in the hospital just a few months earlier 4 technically the killer did kill one of his victims the guy he injected with poison that had to get the antidote if you poison someone that is murder 5 what was adam s lesson that he was supposed to learn yes the doctor needed to be there but what was adam s crime maybe i just missed something other than those things i would have given this movie a higher grade the plot was pretty good and the ways the killer chose to kill his victims were very inventive i can even forgive the terrible acting on the doctor s part the scenes with his family were enough to make me sick the cinematography and soundtrack were very good but the ending seemed contrived and just didn t work for me thank goodness i didn t have to pay to see this or i would have demanded a refund,0
8647,if i had to pick the most depressing movie try to be suspenseful i ve seen it d be this one i know about how good the original is supposed to be it had better be better then this one the movie s so dark and depressing but it isn t interesting to watch either i ve seen depressing thriler type movies that were saved because of the suspense to counteratc and balence the dark quality vanishing didn t have that this was so disturbing to watch to begin with and there was nothing positive to make this a classic type movie i think another imdb poster got it right in saying this genre has just seen thrillers done in a far superior way i completely agree i would recommend skipping this one maybe i ll watch the original some day but i doubt it i give this a 2 out of 10,0
10805,i went to see this movie to kill some time i remember cole hauser in tigerland and although his acting is wooden he does portray a tough leader character same here this movie was about a bunch of young hot scientists and divers exploring a cave in romania that one has to dive to see the beginning scene was very interesting with a bunch of romanian or russian men exploring the cave in search of booty flash forward 30 years and we have a team of divers called in by some scientist and his crew to explore some cave for some unknown scientific purpose there is a lot of clich d useless talk the women are too hot for their jobs let s face it i hate to watch the lips of these women talk about the guys while drinking beer at the pre cave exploration party i mean it was like we were at some bar with frat and sorority types talking about the opposite sex not a group of scientists and divers every character had zero personality with perhaps exception of the scientist who at least wasn t one of the young and beautiful people so the acting although workmanlike was not inspiring the dialog was pretty bad at one point in the movie cole hauser jack the lead diver his irises morph into the cingular wireless symbol and stay like that we are led to believe that since he was scratched by one of these monsters that he is turning into one of them fair enough but first of all nobody says the obvious thing to him what is up with your eyes dude no everybody just talked about how he s changed and that he should not be the leader of the group anymore and then this guy says you see how he s not human huh if they really believed he was a friggin monster then why not act like it instead the group splits in two those who go with jack and those who go their separate ways i guess thinking him to be a monster it makes no sense the best scene in the movie was this blonde diver woman crawls up a cave wall and gets attacked by this goblin her scream really sucked but she fought like hell to dispatch the goblin the photography was fine when the camera was still but any action sequences the director found it useful to confuse the hell out of us by flashing bubbles flashlights dark space god knows what i wish they would just show us a scene straight once in awhile just because you move the camera all over the place doesn t make the movie any scarier folks this movie could have been a lot better if the following changes had been made 1 every actor was replaced by someone who looked real let cole hauser be the lead it s ok to let him be the good looking one i m getting tired of seeing 20 something supermodel scientists give me a break people 2 the cinematographer was fired and replaced by one who just pointed the camera and sat still this could be the director s fault i don t know jumpy camera as in constant gardener is getting old folks 3 we got to see the goblins actually devour the people how bout some gore there s not much else in this movie we barely got to see the creatures i felt a little ripped off about that 4 the ending was pretty lame during the denouement the sexy british scientist has a secret guess what that is it s a bit canned the ending would have been better if they all died instead of the black guy morris chestnut who seemed to breathe a little sympathy into his character just by his worried expressions all the other actors had no expression i gave it a 4 out of 10 because after all the acting was without noticeable errors and the concept was fairly original i d like to see cole do more military roles he s good at it,0
18912,sally and saint anne is a very funny movie the first time my mom told me about it i was 7 and saint anne had just been the saint i had for my communion saint my mom knew this so she told me to watch this with her i did and have seen it many times since because it is really funny aunt bea from the andy griffith show was in it and sally s grandfather was the guy who played santa claus in miracle on 34th street so there were lots of actors we seen on tv shows too there is a bad guy who keeps trying to steal the house away and sally keeps trying things with st anne to help raise money so they can keep the house that includes a boxing match with hugh o brian who plays her older brother this is a good and funny movie that i still love,1
13859,ocean s twelve is probably better than ocean s eleven i know most people would disagree but i actually liked it more after three years it was good seeing the gang return the reason behind the heist is a bit more inspired the second time around i see why they stole from benedict andy garcia in the last film this film they have a bit more motivation the second time around ocean s twelve is more entertaining and cooler than ocean s eleven with a funny cameo by topher grace saying i just walked in that new dennis quaid movie and other things i think ocean s twelve is probably the best in the series the plot a year or so after ocean s twelve terry benedict the guy they robbed in the last film is back and says that if ocean s eleven doesn t pay him back the money they stole he s going to call the cops so danny ocean and the gang go to europe where rusty meets his old cop girlfriend isabelle after she meets him again she begins to follow them around also the gang learns that they have an enemy who is also a thief who is a little better than they are with many funny scenes like when tess julia roberts goes to europe and pretends to be julia roberts ocean s twelve is a pretty clever film it s cooler funnier and more entertaining than ocean s eleven,1
4,first off let me say if you haven t enjoyed a van damme movie since bloodsport you probably will not like this movie most of these movies may not have the best plots or best actors but i enjoy these kinds of movies for what they are this movie is much better than any of the movies the other action guys segal and dolph have thought about putting out the past few years van damme is good in the movie the movie is only worth watching to van damme fans it is not as good as wake of death which i highly recommend to anyone of likes van damme or in hell but in my opinion it s worth watching it has the same type of feel to it as nowhere to run good fun stuff,0
5535,i wasn t expecting citizen kane but i was hoping for some extreme guilty pleasure the script is bad but the school exterior shots were obviously done with the same 5 extras on the same day the dorm exterior shots were easily shot during a hurricane the wardrobe was swapped around so much i hoped the wardrobe mistress had some good strong soap to wash the panties i know the budget s time but do you think they could have bought a couple of different styles of underwear what oversexed up vampiric hot chick would wear boy leg panties under latex trousers i was relieved to see one appearance of thong in the penultimate scene good points the actors were all very attractive and the girls had natural boobs too bad they never took the bras off the special effects were neither effective and could only be describes as special if they rode the short bus to the edit bay the final scene in particular is horrifically laughably bad lizzzzzzzz,0
11690,honestly how hard can it be to make a good remake obviously pretty hard i was soooo excited to see this because i loved the original and my friends go and see it and tell me it really sucks well i finally see it and i was sooo disapointed ok the shower scene was more realistic that s why i gave it a 3 otherwise it did suck vince vaughn does a terrible job playing norman he s just too dense or something i don t know it was just terrible don t see it,0
20608,honestly at first i watched this movie because of the gratuitous sex scenes i heard it possesses but by actually watching the film it just made me realize that there are still good and sensible movies out there truly it is one of the most well crafted and touching movies i ve ever watched i m a teenage bisexual and the film spoke to me about my predicaments sex religion love acceptance etc it gave me an idea on how to deal with these issues with the help of my self and others around me who love me for who i am cox really handled the movie well by sprinkling dozes of heart warming lines and a bit of sexuality in it it made the movie more interesting some people compare it to brokeback mountain but i don t agree myself brokeback mountain has more drama while latter days is well balanced,1
20552,i watched this film recently for the first time in over 30 years and was very pleasantly surprised i remembered a film that caught the mood and feel of britain in the mid 1960s without falling into the swinging britain clich s that so many other films thought they had to propagate my memory proved correct those who feel that this is like a tv play are not entirely wrong but while andrea newman was to become famous for risqu tv drama this film is more in the tradition of the kitchen sink films such as saturday night and sunday morning but with an emphasis on middle class rather than working class life rod steiger is excellent as the middle aged angst ridden lead unhappily married to a repressed and apparently barren wife claire bloom the onset of the technological revolution is the the backdrop for the drama in which old values and certainties are challenged this is the stage for the central character played by judy geeson a role which at the time was a shocking departure from the typical prim behaviour of contemporary heroines the reversal of roles with the girl rating her conquests in a little black book was a precursor to the feminist movement and was criticised at the time for promoting promiscuity among young girls the irony of these criticisms is to be seen in both claire bloom s and peggy ashcroft s characters who are both acceptingly dissatisfied peter hall made few films and on this evidence that is a great shame steiger is exemplary and wholly credible showing why he was so highly regarded,1
5759,this film was pure trash not the worse film ever if it were to be broken down the acting was good enough to get the job done but the script was so out there and so stupid that one was left thinking where did my life go even vanessa redgrave whom i love and is the reason i watched this was wasted utterly wasted she didn t even leave an impression the directing was so distant that non of the characters left me much of anything but to see redgrave leave nothing her part was nothing she was good as a mean boss but that was it do depth and she s given depth to small roles see venus and atonement i would not waste my time and was upset to have spent the 5 on this movie i wanted it back no returns skip the film it ll only bring you grief and boredom,0
9151,based on a fairly bland best seller this film like most other lifetime movies played out more like a reenactment than an actual movie the only difference here was that meredith baxter wasn t in it the women in this don t age even over a span of like 20 years and the acting in general is pretty bad the characters in this were all clich and one dimensional the story was of the cheesy nature i wouldn t recommend it but it s the kind of thing that people who loved the book and people who watch that network all the time will think is great i only watched it because my girlfriend wanted to see it so she wouldn t have to read the book her sister loaned to her it wasn t made for someone like me my girlfriend cried a little at the end though so she didn t think it was as terrible as i did,0
5287,before miracle on 34th street maureen o hara and john payne made this this this film i was going to describe it but can t find words for how badly this film turned out the subject matter of adopting a child and maureen s illness are both very serious and sensitive issues but that notwithstanding this could have been done a whole lot better than it was it was so extreme in its portrayal that it didn t come across as real at all probably its problem started with a weak script another example of a screenwriter taking a novel and writing a weak movie see my review of a stranger in my arms the beautiful o hara was often saddled with clunkers like this another being forbidden street britannica mews which i may review eventually if you have any emotional ties to this from childhood you ll be kinder to this rather lifeless colorless and lackluster film but for something along the lines of this maybe you can find its tv movie remake it has to be better it has to be,0
18062,not since j michael straczynski s babylon 5 has a television show captured the wonderful art of applying a story arc to a television show this is easily the best thing on tv right now the characters are likable and one can easily get attached to them and care for their well being the villians are the type you love to hate and leave you wondering what they re up to next and brian hensen s puppet work is the most innovative out there kudos to rockne s o bannon for a job well done,1
6238,well killshot is not awful but it comes close production values are decent and the main actors do a pretty good job except for rosario dawson in a wasted role but the story is just pathetic i don t know if the elmore leonard book had such dumb characters since i haven t read it but i m guessing that the book was supposed to be at least slightly humorous the movie has no detectable humor after the first twenty minutes you ll be yelling at the screen oh come on nobody s that stupid in a nutshell and without any spoilers everybody acts in a manner convenient to the plot which makes no sense anyway a very frustrating and unrealistic movie which may account for it sitting on the shelf for as long as it did,0
1908,the movie adaptation of heart of darkness is disappointing both as a movie and as a representation of joseph conrad s classic story there are several small differences between the book and movie but that s expected in any book to movie transition kurtz dies in a different location the manager does not accompany marlow on his voyage kurtz s mistress spends much more time with him than in the story the real issue is the amount of footage that s put into the movie but has no basis in the actual story for some reason the director finds the need to spice up a few of the scenes adding drama or actions that seldom make any sense and are always unimportant to the story some examples that come to mind are kurtz s mistress beating marlow over the head and knocking him out nothing happens while he s unconscious and marlow didn t even provoke the attack a couple hours pass and he wakes up total waste of time kurtz has a pet monkey which for some random reason he kills on a whim also when marlow leaves kurtz s station he makes the noble decision to leave behind all the priceless ivory he had obtained for no real reason at all one other flaw is kurtz s character john malkovich is a terrible choice to play the man who is described as tall and inspirational a man with a commanding presence he practically whispers all of his lines which in a more capable actor s hands could have been very thought provoking i can t remove the image of john malkovich playing a mentally disabled farmhand in of mice and men when i m watching him botch the role of kurtz over all i would rate the movie at 3 out of 10 stars it s a good movie if you ve read the book and want to see it in movie form perhaps to help you visual the scenes but as a source of entertainment i would never recommend it,0
21890,this is a great late night movie what i mean by that is that i truly have enjoyed playing my 3 00 vhs copy now i have a 6 99 dvd copy many nights just before bedtime or if i have insomnia there s just something about this movie that makes it fun to watch in repeated viewings it could be the fun that basil rathbone has in the secret weapon wearing several disguises which fool the bad guys and holmes s assistant nigel bruce watson but not the housekeeper mary gordon it could be the espionage code cracking and ww ii theme it could even be the light touch which the director uses to handle the threatening situations holmes finds himself in while keeping the story moving whatever it is secret weapon is simply a pleasant and enjoyable detective story which takes us back to a time when the nazis were seeking world domination and does it with the bonus of the camaraderie between watson and holmes whether you agree with the patriotic speeches and noble save the world themes of this movie or not i think they are right on i find that they only add to the flavor and fun of this fine old adventure film that holds up to repeated viewings i rate it a pleasant 83 100 points,1
10357,dorothy stratten is the only reason to watch this unfunny sci fi spoof and her appearance is a disappointment though she has the title role her screentime is limited and she only speaks a few lines of dialogue if you re not a stratten fan pass this one up,0
7027,owen david krumholtz and chloe denise richards are a youngish couple living in manhattan owen is a moderately successful magazine writer while chloe is an aspiring actress happily for her chloe gets big role on a sitcom and temporarily moves to hollywood missing her owen books a flight to lala land as a surprise when he arrives at her set trailer however the house is shaking as chloe and her hunky co star are having a little romantic tryst the writer and the actress are through hurt and mad as a hatter owen goes back to nyc sympathetic friends decide to set him up on a blind date with nadine milla jovovich to get him out of his sulky funk but it goes badly as the duo mix like oil and water mostly due to each having a strong personality and owen s huge shoulder chip yet over the next few months astonishingly nadine and owen become pals who confide in each other and hang out can it turn into something more well who the heck cares this film is so stupid that most folks will yank it out of the dvd player after the first ten minutes the script is pathetic dismal and oh stupid too then again krumholtz gives a very obnoxious and offensive performance as well jovovich is not much better but who could look good with the lines she has to spout william baldwin too reaches a career low with his crude and sex crazy role as owen s brother the only cast member who is any good is richards but she must cringe when she looks back at this one okay the costumes and production values are adequate then too there is one clever element in that occasionally the characters will speak their lines but cartoon bubbles will appear above their heads with the words of what they are truly thinking that doesn t save the film from bomb status don t be stupid dear film and romcom lovers do not rent buy or borrow this gigantic turkey i am the stupidest person on earth today for watching this thing until the bitter end,0
13163,don t look in the basement is so easy to knock but the truth is simply that brownrigg is one of horrors real underground stars and imho is vastly overdue some proper recognition don t is his undisputed masterpiece this scummy psychodrama snags the viewer straightaway into such an odd disjointed claustrophobic world of sweating insanity you have no real idea what the hell is going on it succeeds in making you feel strangely dirty just plain grubby for brownrigg s world is this mad unwashed scummy prison cell of rants obsessions and all shades of mental illness and he uses his low budget palette to wrap his grot blanket around you like a bad memory there is just something so beautifully odd about the whole damn thing in a word classic also if you watch don t first then you will have some idea of the insane psychodrama style that marks brownrigg s other films in summary they really don t come any more esoteric than this well actually they do track down brownrigg s keep my grave open mad genius accept no substitute,1
10457,and obviously i didn t see it but looking at the cast and seeing that doug masters is back from the dead i know now to avoid this like the plague i hate it when hollywood producers writers directors or all of the above think that audiences are stupid that they re not going to catch continuity errors a supposedly dead doug masters returning is a big giant one won t you say and i can t believe that someone like louis gossett jr would return for something like that did jason gedrick really decline this well i hate to say it but even if he took the role again it would have still had that same continuity error i bet if he really turned it down he must have been incredulous seeing that his character died in the second film i ll probably catch it by accident on a late night air on some channel but no way am i going to rent this or buy the dvd,0
24277,i was lucky enough to see a test screening of el padrino a couple months ago in santa monica i was blown away you don t see films like this anymore in the vein of scosese chapa deftly tells the tragic story of kilo as he maneuvers the tough streets of la to rise above the ranks to become a drug lord of escobarian proportions the characters are complex and conflicted the emotions are real the action is fast and furious the stunts are expansive and tilly is hot she hasn t looked this good since her bound days i d recommend this to anyone it s a fantastic homage to the epic action films of the late 80s and early 90s and to all the naysayers out there watch it again you obviously had your eyes closed the first time congrats to all involved in the film i m counting the days until the sequel is released anyone have a date on that,1

4621,acclaimed argentine horror director emilio vierya directs a script from jack curtis and antonio ross cheesy and ridiculous are in the mix for the method to the madness a doctor s son is nearing his early death until his desperate father transplants an ape s heart into his chest as expected things are going to get weird when this young man turns into a mask wearing monster and roams the beaches scouting out nice looking party girls to make his slaves when heroin is injected his beauties become zombies the monster summons his dazed minions with strange organ music so bad well it s just bad in the cast jose e moreno alberto caneau mauricio de ferraris gloria prat and gina moret,0
24021,just to clarify matthew poncelet wasn t a real person but a character combination of 2 killers who were both convicted and sentenced to die for a murder of two teenagers i read the user comments and they react as if matthew was real the character is based on a mixture of two killers elmo patrick sonnier and robert lee willie who murdered separate people and the murder itself was based on the one willie committed the conflict of both willie having someone else present and both parties swearing the other did the killing is worked into the story as well prejean s approach is unique in that she not only is ministering to the convicts as they wait for their death and aiding them in taking responsibility for their actions she also reaches out to the victims families to help them know that the convict did indeed feel remorse for what they did effectively aiding both parties everyone posting here seems to have strong beliefs on the death sentence it s not my place to say it s right or wrong in theory punishing death with death makes some sort of karmic sense however denying a person their freedom for the rest of their days although costly makes more sense to me being stuck in a small room 23 7 with one hour of exercise for the rest of their days to be reminded of the cruel thing they did seem a more apt punishment they are technically alive but denied living say someone killed someone so they could get out of the responsibility the person they killed required like susan smith killing her poor kids by shoving her car into a lake i find it fittingly ironic that they would not get that freedom they craved and would now have to spend the rest of their days imprisoned prejean s point comes through the story very well she has my respect she manages to find that balance she isn t supporting a killer she is guiding them to accepting what they did if they didn t feel some kind of remorse they wouldn t be asking for spiritual guidance ona final note when poncelet apologizes to delacroix parent for killing his son the parents of the girl who was also murdered mutters something about why he didn t apologize for her death i think the point was that throughout the movie poncelet denies killing both kids there is doubt in prejean s mind he did both killings there is a friend who was sentenced but not to death my thought is that poncelet killed the delacroix boy and the other man murdered the girl hence poncelet was taking responsibility for what he did had he been responsible for the girl s death he probably would have apologized for that as well,1
20912,well first of all it s not a bad movie it is good and i like the characters introduced i also like lady and tramp s voices more in this however i would like to see lady and tramp more i know it says scamp s adventure and i love scamp and angel to bits but it s a sequel to the original where in my opinion they should of just released it as scamp s adventure not lady and the tramp ii scamp s adventure tramp did have quite a role but he didn t have much time with lady but anyway the songs are quite good and scamp and angel are sweet i ve seen better sequels but hey it s not a failure i give it 7 10 very good but still had flaws,1
4736,would you be surprised if i told you this movie deals with a conspiracy no how about if i told you the ringleader was a shadow puppet what you don t believe me ok yes i made that up it s too bad this movie could have used a sense of humor i understand charlie sheen doing this at the time another movie equaled more money as for donald sutherland and linda hamilton why don t even get me started on stephen lang he was so much fun as the party crasher in the hard way and now this junk ah no matter everyone involved should feel ashamed if you aim to make a bad movie and succeed it s twisted but i seriously doubt that was what they were aiming for here flat out the story stinks and we re actually supposed to take this yak seriously makes you wonder if this movie even had a glimmer of hope seriously i doubt it and in an industry so tight with the purse strings how this got green lit in the first place is beyond me maybe even more scary is how this dog pile made it s way to theaters oh sam waterson how great you are in law order why are you here demoting yourself to the role of the president of the united states who might i add gets to be shot at by a remote control biplane controlled by the gonzo assassin then again this is a masterpiece of work from george p cosmatos who s directing credits include rambo first blood part ii amongst other gems hmm case in point,0
13473,tumbling doll of flesh aka niku daruma and psycho the snuff reels this was on my want list for quite a while and then i finally scored a copy on ebay a while back it s never been on dvd and what i got from ebay was a very good quality dvd r which i m quite satisfied with the movie is i believe the most extreme example of torture porn with an emphasis on porn a woman responds to an ad for a porn movie and goes with the producer to a place where it is filmed the porn is definitely real with the annoying japanese pixelation to try and hide the hardcore shots without much success most of the time after the porn movie is shot and the actress is ready to leave she gets clubbed over the head with a baseball bat and taken back to the room and savagely dismembered in slow shots and in one of the most disgusting scenes the male porn guy screws her in an open wound in her chest this is after both legs have been severed her arm and a few other niceities this movie outdoes the guinea pig series by a long shot in fact they are not even close to the realism although cheap gore effects shown in this movie this is indeed one of the best fake snuff films i have ever seen if not the best now i must warn you that if you are not into this stuff you should stay far far away this movie is very strong and with the real sex it is in a very sick way erotic to an extent and i mean in a very sick way but wherever you come down on this subject material this movie brings the goods home and i would definitely recommend you seek it out after reading about the movie i was expecting something very strong but it exceeded that by a bunch,1
1081,with hong kong heart throb andy lau and veteran star ching wan lau aau chin has everything going for it for the beginning part of the movie unfortunately the movie falls apart at the end andy lau plays a sophisticated thief who only has 4 weeks to live but still has one thing unfinished he pulls an elaborated scheme tricking the police into helping him however the police is hot on his tail can he pull it off before being caught the build up of the movie is good bits of pieces of clues are left behind for the audiences to try to guess at the real intention unfortunately the build up leads to a disappointed final showdown it feels as if in the middle of the script the writer has changed and that all the build up becomes disconnected a 3 10,0
860,without being really the worst science fiction film ever made or the worst i have seen time under fire is still much under average the premises and the first 10 15 minutes are not that bad it starts as a x files story combining bermuda triangle mysteries with time travel pretty soon elements of other genres too many mix together but the story never takes off beyond the level of interest of a tv series soon time under fire quickly degenerates into a series of clich s not only mixing altogether too many genres but also being unable to create anything memorable in suspense or special effects that would help viewers remember the movie until tomorrow acting is bad and the rhetoric lines in the script do not help at all,0
3376,i love watching a good gory giallo unfortunately solange is definitely not one of them it s long very long the story is tacky and makes very little sense even if it s very obvious the script spends so much time on the killings and the girls but it spends almost no time at all on the killer this leaves a big hole in the story we might get to see a bunch of young women showering together but we get zero characterization of why the killer decided to murder those girls yes what happened to solange is terrible but we still pretty much left in the dark over when why did the boring killer decided that it was worth going through the effort of offing those oh so naughty girls it s all so contrived that i couldn t get into it one bit as for the look of the film again boring nothing memorable about it the actors boring the script laughably boring the whole torrid love affair between the teacher the blond and the student was really embarrassing what planet are they living on the music boring skip it,0

14013,the man with the golden arm otto preminger s controversial panoramic crime drama plays itself out among the mental descriptions of its living and architectural occupants in rhythmic lashing arrangement opening the film a closeup from within a bar of frankie looking in through the window already tells us to the prominence that the protagonist s subjective experience will grasp pulled in the direction of increasingly slighter spaces the film shuts itself off as the local gangster s long drawn out poker game shuts itself from the daylight bolts itself in as sinatra s frankie machine has himself locked in a room in the celebrated scene of his harrowing struggle to overcome his habit in delving into the shapes and faces of its jazzy urban haven the visual traffic in the man with the golden arm characterizes skewed psychological circumstances forming an overpowering environment as maintained by the recurring tracking shots into closeups of frankie s eyes the grace of this fiery drama striking as early as the exciting opening crane shot displays the command over the perceptible world that studio production allows the wonderfully dilapidated urban sets define an independent place with no beginnings or ends an indeterminate state the sort that in reality hardly last as long as this skid row seems to before being gentrified or leveled the flair of certain performances particularly robert strauss s as the wonderfully named underworld gambling boss schwiefka and arnold stang as frankie s trusty four eyed lapdog becomes this fiery surreal feature pleasingly the premise of drug addiction sinatra s powerhouse performance elmer bernstein s infectious forceful jazz score and saul bass s famous influential and controversial opening sequence centering on the animated paper cut out of a heroin addict s arm ensured that in its era the man with the golden arm presses forward upon the cause for realism in the still reticent hollywood it is impressionistic and subjective as i say but its intent its force and its spirit are much closer to home what absorbs me the most in this film is its aspect as a gangster film it has the illegal card games short cons the fights the guns the double crosses characters on the lam a femme fatale a stunningly sexy gun moll the shady nightclubs and urban landscape but it does more than exploit this environment for entertainment really it is the perfect environment and genre in which to tell this story a crime ridden urban borough where it s all too comfortable to escape through a bottle or two or three or four or drugs a transient dose that really just functions to keep one in obscurity from any enlightenment and all the clear scenarios the world could bid,1
2914,low rent version of ashley judd s double jeopardy sutherland is too professional to be bad but what was brigit fonda thinking the penelope ann miller curse continues think about it when has she ever been in a good movie other than other people s money and i m not saying she s bad but all of her movies fail in some way,0
21583,great film a very worthy 7 10 tom hanks was at his usual best the heavy drinking congressman who saved afghanistan from its communist oppressors based upon a true story tells us how the west throws money and arms at a problem and expect it to go away well it did go away albeit temporarily look who we the british amongst others are now fighting the very same people who the us gave arms training and money to in the 80s this film was always going to provoke political thoughts by the people who watch it but it does portray a very nice story however once the main objective is achieved i e ridding the communists from afghanistan it is seen how quickly the plight of people is forgotten about this film was good it was a well deserved 7 10 it told the story of the communist invasion of afghanistan and the subsequent covert operation by the us to some detail and was dramatised well although being a good film i will recommend it to people but some people will not enjoy it particularly is a serious film about good us v evil russia isn t your thing,1
6585,the writers and creators of this film should actually be sued for polluting the world with this crap man in the mirror is in fact beyond horrible way way way beyond and people i m not just saying that because i m a michael jackson fan or due to the fact that this is truly one of the most retarded depictions of his life i ve ever encountered i m saying it because this is a waste of time money and celluloid i feel ashamed of myself just having seen all of it that s 1 hour and 26 min of my life i ll never get back i m telling you watching grass grow is literally more entertaining than this film consider yourselves warned,0
11284,while not as bad as some movies like the horrible atomic twister meltdown still relies upon common misconceptions and inaccuracies about the nuclear power industry to advance its plot i am currently studying nuclear engineering in the pursuit of a masters degree and it was easy to point out flaws that would be obvious to anyone involved with the industry riding the false fear that a chernobyl style meltdown could happen in an american plant the movie states that any meltdown even partial according to one of the guest commentators in the movie would mean disaster for the area in fact a partial meltdown in an american plant while destroying the core would not pose any risk to the surrounding area three mile island experienced a partial meltdown and no radioactive material was released into the environment at all thanks to the natural stability of the fuel and core design used in this country paired with substantial containment the security steps shown in the movie were perhaps the part of the movie furthest from the truth at any important strategic location be it power plant chemical plant military base anything you will never see personnel responding to an alarm by milling around talking as if it were an unannounced drill this is especially true at a nuclear plant where upon the sounding of the alarm the reactors would be scramed immediately shutting them off scraming can be done with the push of a button in the control room you do not need to put the core in shutdown mode like depicted in the movie and the chemistry of nuclear fission prevents a core from being brought back up to power within about 9 hours of a scram so if this scenario played out in real life the assailants would not be able to cause a significant meltdown in theory they could still cause a partial one due to residual heat if they exposed the core immediately but that would be almost impossible given the numerous backup systems present in a plant there are many more than the single backup pumps they speak of in the movie as for the spent fuel pools it may be possible to turn the pools into a dirty bomb by blowing them up but this is far more difficult than simply parking a truck full of explosives near the pools the fuel is under approximately 18 feet of highly purified water the water cannot become radioactive no radioactive steam like they speak of in the movie particles dissolved in water can but the water itself cannot thus the reason for very thorough purification so the only way to turn a fuel pool into a dirty bomb is to get the fuel out of the water this is no easy task as water is very heavy and the pools are below ground with very thick concrete walls the explosives would have to be in the pool below the fuel which is securely fastened and there would have to be a heck of a lot of explosives as water is very hard to move through an explosion even if this were to occur spent fuel is not extremely radioactive and the explosion would not cause nearly as high a death toll as mentioned in the movie especially given the small amount of radioactive material that would be spread from a basic movie standpoint i grew somewhat tired of the style used the constant fading in and out use of gritty black and white and fast tracking and panning looked amateurish the characters were one dimensional especially those in the us government i have some problems with the twist thrown in the movie but will not discuss it as it would be a major spoiler overall 3 10,0
5779,this abomination and the sequel one more time no thanks and the hideous jerry lewis disasters like don t raise the bridge lower the water why not just flush instead drove cinema owners to close their doors rather than be forced to run these films true in the 60s block booking of films was still enforced on hapless suburban and country cinemas this means that in order to get a good film the cinema was forced to run woeful timewasters like these i remember well in 1974 keen to screen fiddler on the roof or something good like that i was bailed up in the united artists booking office by some sozzled salesman who waved a sheet of flops before me and squinted bellowing now before we get to that one lemme see ya date these ones first which basically means book these duds and we will give ya a tired hit this is how and why so many cinemas closed forced to screen and annoy their waning audiences with these assembly line failures with lame comedians and bored talent cinema owners exhausted with arguing simply closed sold to a petrol station and saw the cinema demolished these days the same type of films eg i now pronounce you chuck and larry get banished to the 20 seat cinema 99 in a mega google plex instead not much has changed freddy got fingered anyone,0
10352,i don t really know why so many persons love this movie maybe it s funny ok but it has totally ruined one of the best novels ever written as the author himself said this movie has betrayed the book not only the story is violently cut to about 1 3 but all the symbols all the complexity everything is lost in a very 80 s fashioned fantasy adventure film for kids today we have effects directors a new attention to books i hope that someone tim burton peter jackson hayao miyazaki someday will direct the real neverending story a great dead writer a wonderful book and many literature lovers deserve it,0
19970,being a retired medical health field toiler in the vinyard i never get tired of seeing this film paddy chayefsky was a friend of my college comp teacher visited him us during several clases back in 1958 his writing ability has stood the test of time the hospital is as fresh as it was in 1971 i can watch it every week still find something new so many of the supporting cast members went unto bigger better roles in both tv film george scott made only a few comedies but his timing patter are as good as jackie gleason steve msrtin mental humour rather than physcial slapstick wins in my book every time and still a family film with only 1 four letter word during entire film,1
19879,the gymnast 2006 was written and directed by ned farr dreya weber portrays jane hawkins a former world class gymnast who was seriously injured and now earns her living as a certified massage therapist the promotional material leads you to believe that the plot hinges around jane s accidental reunion with a former teammate although this meeting takes place that plot line is secondary to the main plot which involves jane her husband and a professional dancer named serena addie yungmee the two women develop an act of the type performed by cirque de soleil the two complement each other jane is more experienced with heights and has tremendous upper body strength serena is more elegant and artistic although obviously also capable of incredible physical feats the film works because we can understand how jane would turn to addie who is caring and compassionate while jane s husband has taken her for granted for the many years of their marriage both women are incredibly fit and athletic and dreya has the lean body and well defined muscles that are characteristic of gymnasts they clearly are truly performing their act and the results are so excellent that we can believe they would indeed be a success in las vegas or anywhere else they traveled the sexual tension between the women is obvious and the situation becomes even more complex when the act requires them to kiss while suspended in the air a woman with a neglectful husband and an attractive woman partner make for an explosive situation which isn t resolved in a neat and tidy fashion of the six films we saw at the rochester ny lesbian and gay film and video festival we thought this one was the best it will work on dvd and is definitely worth seeking out on large or small screen note stay for the credits,1
18436,i missed the beginning of the film i came in when the partisan s were in the farm house i can truthfully say that it was horrifying the moral ramifications are staggering my fear of pain and torture leave me unable to see myself other than cowardly i see the christ like ability that was depicted by the brave patriot and i can only pray that i could or would have the moral turpitude to follow his example i see that a main theme of the film is to show the weakness strength of the tortured but what a dismal decision to have to be confronted with all because the soul of man can be distorted in such a way that pain and suffering being brought to bear on a fellow human being is in some way satisfying be it mental or physical i found the film very thought provoking,1
232,this movie just didn t do it for me i like horror and splatter movies but this one has very little to do with horror the effects are cheap and when they chop of one of her feet it looks so fake the same goes for the other effects like the tongue torture and the gut sex they could have spent of few extra bucks on the effects with lots of sex with pixelization as in all japanese movies this is just a sick fetish porn and there seems to be a market for sick stuff like this while bloodier for me it fits in with titles like squirmfest purge and the genki series these movies feature girls eating and playing with every fluid that comes out of your body eating bugs and fish in a gross way and having sex with all kinds of weird animals like toads eels and one look at the covers will tell horror fans to look elsewhere no horror here just sick and degrading sex scenes horror fans should avoid this one and are better of checking out guinea pig2 flowers of flesh and blood or even august underground mordum while these are not great they at least offer a horror experience and niku daruma absolutely fails in that department,0
7941,this movie was unbelievably bad it s gory but the violence is just too much to the point where it looks extremely fake and predictable since everything is shown to you there is nothing left to the imagination and the plot what plot there really isn t any the pacing is unbelievably slow despite the random acts of violence and the screenplay must have been written by a deranged 12 year old kid who kills kittens for fun so this movie was banned in 31 countries i could see why not because of the gore boring and trite but because it was a terrible movie it should have been banned from existence avoid this one like the plague 1 out of 10,0
21461,can t get much eerier than flatliners this deep dark film had my heart pumping throughout the lighting is dark and will get you in the mood for a death defying experience literally keifer is in top form as he is today in 24 he s a great actor and he plays a very convincing and shocking role you won t forget for years to come and what can you say for the rest of the cast an all star lineup julia is hotter than ever will oliver and kevin light up the stage in this thriller that will keep you gripping your seats it s a refreshing sight to see a true thriller with top notch professional actors you won t regret seeing this 2 hour seat bender jl,1
20937,we bought the dvd of walking with dinosaurs and have been nearly ecstatic over the things that are done so very well on it many dvds today offer the bare minimum the feature itself and maybe one other language which doesn t help the viewer at all but makes it easier for the company to see the dvd in multiple markets not so in the case of wwd there are so many wonderful extras and well thought out vignettes that watching even the navigation menu is interesting the intros to each chapter in the making of dvd are laugh out loud funny the quality of the sound and video is terrific and of course the story and content what more could a dinosaur lover ask for i did watch most of the version broadcast on tdc narrated by avery brooks then watched about half of the dvd narrated by kenneth branaugh as near as i can tell the broadcast version slipped in a number of mostly american slang terms in the narration i e in a section about t rex mating branugh says the female is tiring of the male s attention and brooks says the honeymoon is over and cut out some of the closer in puppet work i prefer the branugh version simply because it is more complete overall a great value and wonderful production many kudos to the bbc and the crew that made this gem,1
19776,this movie is quite better than the first one ast rix et obelix contre c sar but it is far away from perfection the adaptation of the comic book is good some of the pictures and the dialogs of the movie are the same as in the book but there s few things that made the movie not as interresting as the animated movie released in 1968 for example the fighting between numerobis and amonbofis this wasn t necessary or even credible either for the little love story of ast rix there were also some stuff missing like the songs that are in the animated movie and some other things i am deceived by the movie because they cutted in the stuff i was expecting tho see and they showed things that i did not wanted or needed to see i know that it would have been very difficult to make the movie exactly the same than the comic book or the animated movie but that s what i expected in conclusion even if the movie is good i still prefer the animated movie wich is in my opinion far better,1
11261,i think trash really sucks i watched it a couple of weeks ago and i haven t seen that kind of c p at the cinema since female trouble by john waters and that was even worse the dialogues the acting it really stank it was so bad it made me want to leave the cinema and ask for my money back but actually i am glad i saw it because then i could tell my honest opinion on it one should see this film even though it stinks,0
14889,i have to say this is one of the best movie i have seen so far for naruto the action was a lot better then the first movie because it had a lot more fight scene and it came to u at a faster pace it was amazing the choreograph was excellent as well as most of the visual effects the story line is something new to naruto but it is basically the same as the first movie in the series u see them fight against other ninjas but in the movies 1 2 u see them fighting against machine of mass destruction it is nice to see them fighting something other then ninja and that it was great to see some other power other then chakra and how other people from other land across the ocean fight also sakura finally killed someone that is more stronger then her she have truly become strong it was a lot better then the fillers on the series that i m watching now when u watch this movie the fast action scene will surely make your heart pound with new jutsus and garra in the movie u know it is good and the music was good as well but i find it to be lacking something but the ending theme song was a plus dind dong dang i think was a really good song i totally recommend it all in all i give this movie a 10 because i just love it if u do decide to watch it enjoy it lol,1
24890,i believe john houston s the dead is a true classic not only was it houston s final film he is quoted as saying all i know about film making is in this film the story closely adapted from dubliners by james joyce is a great ensemble piece featuring sterling performances by angelica houston john s daughter and a cast of english and irish actors who bring the story to life this is a film that should be part of any serious collection not only because it is visually elegant but because the story is timeless and very appealing the film is not hurried nor is it charged with action rather the story unfolds from within the characters who bring light and meaning to the dialog the end of the film is stunning poetic and haunting i recommend the dead without reservation as one of the finest films ever made,1
4297,for everyone who has read this book fanny price ends up maturing into her own woman a beautiful woman with a brain le touzel looks like she is on medication terrible acting she just ruins it henry is a little tall for his character he is also too effeminate mary crawford is brilliant edmond is a little too old mrs norris is hysterical ok this casting decision works rushworth is also perfect yates looks too effeminate also but le touzel is simply horrid this is not a good character for her poor fanny i would recommend this movie only because it includes an almost complete textual account of the language austen uses in the novel the 1999 version is much more fun but terribly incomplete if they could redo this version with a better suited actress for fanny it would be fabulous,0

8172,i thought it will be a ok movie after seeing the commercials about it it was funny at some parts and some very nasty the only person i felt sorry for is horatio sans who got a hot wife who is cheating on him with other women but he never got a chance to have a threesome with until the and that was good but they should have made more bigger thru out the film,0
19769,i watched asterix and obelix in operation cleopatra which was my first exposure to the live action version of the classic comic like the comic the whole movie is full of jokes based upon puns anachronistic jokes and slapstick gags which rarely fall flat asterix and obelix are gauls who use a strength potion to fight the roman legions in their native gaul here they end up in egypt helping a friend build cesar s palace yes its puny in three months to prove the egyptians are just as good as the romans the reason i picked this up was because monica belluci is cleopatra she s good but the role is little more than a cameo however even though she s rarely in the film i didn t care since its so clever and the jokes so funny i was in hysterics i loved it i loved it so much that i can t understand why the movies have never been released in the united states the import dvd has the film in english dub which is quite good especially when you consider that when you watch it in the longer french version the puns and hence the jokes are not always apparent since they are aural so if you read the names wrong the jokes are lost most of the jokes between the full french version and the shorter english dub seem to be exactly the same though some have been changed sometimes for the better and some times for the worse personally i m gonna stick with the dub when i watch this again since its easier to pick up the jokes and enjoy the humor you really will want to see this if you love puns and low brow but clever humor this is a great comedy,1
4452,for a norris movie this is pretty tame for an action movie it is kind of dull and as far as predictability goes my friend and i almost had every turn of this movie nailed it was nice that the killer s every moves were not telegraphed by the cliche s of 80 s action movies but come on the only non predictable move defies the plot and the set up of the editing mainly it is said rather early on that the killer jack o halloran whom is one of the few slightly known actors only kills women yet he all of a sudden stops his m o and kills men huh i guess it can be construed and rationalized some way but why is the movie edited to show that he is going to kill women yet again i m sure that there is a reason i e to build suspense but why spend the time watching it when many other suspense movies are vastly superior fans of renegade may enjoy the small cameo by branscombe richmond as victor but his brief appearence cannot save the movie and even a vote of 4 seems generous,0
18799,a great show first to the people who don t like it don t like it then don t watch it this is was an awesome show better than according to jim a favorite of mine it shows a real family household as opposed to 8 simple rules etc where everything goes peachy they re loud they re messy i can sympathize with their dragging all the garbage into the kitchen it happens in real life sorta like the portal to hell and everyone growling like dogs over the fast food boxes it s a been there show you know what s coming but fun to watch because you have been there before a good cast they work great together a admirable enough show to warrant a dvd release mel gibsons safety videos were a highlight of the series as well opinion good show really deserving of a dvd release deserving to not be canceled as well,1
13499,the greatest movie ever how s that for a contention however if we look at it through purely cinematic terms it is clear that three colours red is a masterpiece it is not enough to merely say this three colours red is the masterpiece of world cinema if you accept that citizen kane is not human enough if you accept that star wars is not actually very good if you accept that ozu and mizoguchi both have to take a step back then three colours red is the foremost masterpiece of all time as a discussion into human morality three colours red works on an intensely metaphysical level with a depth that none can match blue went almost as far into the human psyche but stopped as it was going to pull the rabbit out of the hat white forced us to reflect on the humanity of equality this in retrospect was better still but still not quite there red however is the real thing what he expresses in this movie is an expression of what it is to be human in fact what he expresses is how it is to feel human it forces us to examine up to the minutest detail the very nature of our souls of our ethical selves in red one may find meaning on one of its several levels on the first level red achieves a high level of verisimilitude we could have no trouble in calling red an exceptionally entertaining story however the coincidences inherent in the film and its conceits force us to examine the movie as a movie it is as if kieslowski is saying ceci n est pas la r alit in effect in pursuing a humanistic goal kieslowski can also challenge reality it is a trick that kieslowski has been attempting since le double vie de v ronique but not until this his final film did he finally manage to reach this divine intertwining of fate philosophy and circumstance the actors and actresses too appear to be at the mercy of a greater power valentine ir ne jacob is aptly name for she seems to represent an almost pure love meanwhile the idea of first impressions is challenged by jean louis tritignant s judge kern a cantankerous man who by the end becomes an almost all knowing observer of events a character who symbolically seems to possess the power to bring characters together a power to make people happy a power which he could only achieve through valentine we have a capability to see films as more than just a series of pictures in fact films have the potential to possess more meaning than literature it won t happen of course but at least we have the power to view this film knowing that it gives us the power to achieve the something that we can t define but all possess a synopsis of this film read a film about a woman who runs over a dog well it is isn t it simon huxtable,1
7022,i have loved the book a little princess for most of my life and was very excited that there was a movie but i was appalled at this adaptation not only is the acting wooden and the plot a convoluted mish mash of various incidents in the book but the theme is all wrong the real theme of the story should be that a girl can be a princess only when she behaves like one as sara does when she gives 5 of her 6 buns to a beggar child even when she herself is very hungry the theme of the movie seems to be that all girls are princesses which cheapens sara s actions considerably and seems more like it should be written on a hallmark card than applied to this story there are many other things wrong with this movie too many to list but here are just a few of the larger ones this story should be set in britian in the mid 1800s not america during the first world war miss minchen is harsh to sara from the start making her actions when sara is left penniless much less startling than they would be if she was syrupy sweet at the beginning as she is supposed to be nowhere is it mentioned that becky is black sara s father does not come back he is dead it is his closest friend and collaborator in the diamond mines who finds sara and restores her to her proper place in fact the diamond mines are not even mentioned at all though they are the source of sara s wealth all through everything that sara has faced she always acts like a princess giving what she can and forgiving those who hurt her she would never have called lavinia a snotty two faced bully such a thing is completely out of character for her and undermines the entire philosophy that she is to be well behaved no matter what this is by far the worst adaptation of a book to the screen that i have ever seen with the notable exceptions of ella enchanted and anne of green gables the continuing story the plot of the book is wonderful and skillfully written so i do not understand why the director felt that it needed to be changed to make it interesting i would suggest that anyone wishing to know this story should watch the 1987 version which is far superior or better still read the book it will be more worth your time than the hour and a half wasted on this version on the movie,0

7240,richard donner shows off his liberal credentials with this ludicrously overcooked simplistic attack on the politics of south africa it s not as if america is the cradle of racial harmony and brotherly love and further irony is added by the fact that the movie is set in the city that was the home of rodney king and glorifies the police department that did so much towards community relations with their brutal racist behaviour so donner s salt and pepper pairing who clearly have a late developing teenage crush on one another do their own thing with fine disregard for the rule of law or the rules of evidence and no one worries because the bad guys are white south africans surely a worrying example of police racism in itself inside rudd s joss ackland eminently hissable office the decor is designed and lit to resemble as far as possible the fuhrerbunker and just in case some rather dumb moviegoers miss the point he and his men are referred to as nazis at regular intervals for me the only bright spot in the movie was when mel gibson turned up at an anti apartheid demonstration carrying a banner bearing the inscription end aparthied now the intensely irritating joe pesci is introduced into the franchise to take some of the weight off the boys shoulders by following them around yapping incessantly like a badly trained puppy this would be bearable if there was the remotest possibility of him ending up in a concrete overcoat but sadly he survives to irritate another day miss patsy kensit seems in a world of her own perhaps not believing her luck at being cast opposite mel gibson who has little trouble sweeping her into bed in his mobile home which appears to have been washed up on a beach somewhere shortly after consummating their affair they come under fire from a number of helicopters that fire enough rounds into mel s caravan to keep the u s army in iraq going for six months fortunately he has a pet dog who is not afraid to cause coitus interruptus just as they are going for seconds and his barking warns them of the imminent attack i hope he got a special bone as a reward the film climaxes without interruption from mel s dog on a cargo ship bound for nazi germany sorry south africa when mel and danny murder so many members of the master race that i lost count despite jiggling around like bonnie and clyde under the impact of a hail of bullets mel survives curled up in his partner s arms like a small child with a wise and benevolent father take that apartheid,0
384,attention possible spoilersthis film is so lousy that it actually becomes funny the director has put in all the clich s that have ever plagued b series movies the stupid bimbo nice rack getting caught again and again by the bad guys chief villain smirky and revealing his plots before they happen so they can be ruined and who of course bullied killed the hero s father in an unclear past a side kick in the person of a policeman small bald and whose only preparation for the last battle another clich is returning his baseball cap rim backwards etc the film s end really tops it after the chief villain dies when the hero paralised stoneface jack or whatever throws him from the roof of a building ten stories high they walk out of the building which from the exteriors looks three stories high only and very much like your regular city hall when they exit the building the side kick can t walk being that his right leg appears to be wounded how nobody can tell ten minutes earlier he fell down shot in his shoulder and his feet were fine there is no further explanation for the inquisitive mind of the viewer who would be curious to know such trivial things as where is the villain s body which should lay near the building and why is there no police or even curious folks gathered round the said body i could go on forever with the list why does another one of the bad guys claim to have invented martial arts when he gets his ass kicked in no time why do bad guys in general make silly movements when attacking why does the hero look so faggy is there anyone really thinking yes these characters and this plot makes this a film to remember and the actors suck our hero and saviour of the day wears the same expression on his face the whole film that disgusted trying to be cocky smirk must be some copyrighted feat of him also thinking that until now 12 of the people having rated this film gave it a 10 makes me full of fear inside they might have been serious and then we re doomed,0
2832,billed as a romantic comedy set against the early years of wwii it fails to deliver the problem is that while beautifully photographed it has no consistent story line or narrative starting as a murder mystery it offers no hope to its actors as it meanders through recent history depardieu is wasted in a trivial role he obviously is not comfortable with playing adjani cannot carry the picture the hero is not obviously an imitation of a hitchcock wrongly accused role it lacks balance neither heroic comic nor suspenseful this could have been a good film i am reminded of the lady vanishes which did combine suspense romance and comedy in a serious film dealing with fascism,0
6283,maybe it is unfair for me to review this movie because i walked out well before the end that s odd because i usually like shakespeare on the screen and i enjoyed midsummers night s dream once many years ago when i saw it on the stage i think that two things did me in that squeaky twerp with the shakespearian name calista flockhart and michelle feiffer sitting in a giant clamshell well i suppose you could say it supposed to be a comedy but when the scenery is funny and the actors aren t i d say we have a bad movie on our hands,0
9719,it is really a shame that imdb doesn t let you give negative votes this is the most hideously awful show ever foisted on the american public by our usually likable neighbors to the north the parents are a troglodyte and a neurotic hag he is as charming as a well used fire hydrant with the same hygiene standards she is a wax museum mannequin programmed with more neuroses than the entire cast of the view the kids are non entities if female and repulsive beyond belief if male especially the title character the boy is a serious contender for most insanely smug self satisfied arrogant and vain male character on disney which is saying something this show was obviously conceived as the anti brady bunch but it comes off as the anti christ and why is the photography so dark,0
18839,i ve been watching buffy the vampire slayer and really didn t begin to love the show until season 4 started this episode hush was view by me alone in the dark just after midnight with my windows open and the wind blowing through furiously by an after storm the writers of this episode did an excellent job scaring the heck out of me i was in awe the entire episode which i just finished 2 minutes ago amazing doesn t touch the surface of what this episode accomplishes with almost no dialogue if you ve never given this show much thought at least watch this episode if this doesn t impress you then no episode probably will btw my heart is still racing,1
15688,robin hood men in tights 1993 was a much needed parody from mel brooks he has the assignment of spoofing the robin hood legacy and the couple of movie dealing with the mythical honorable thief of english folklore cary elwes stars as robin hood he s looking for a few good men who ll join him in his quest to topple the evil sheriff of nottingham roger rees and win the fair hand of maid marian robin also has to deal with prince john richard lewis as well tracey ullman co stars as prince john s personal witch latrine who has her eyes on the sheriff will robin find his merry men how far will the prince go to throw his weight around in the absence of his father why does the sheriff hate robin so much to find out you ll have to watch robin hood men in tights check out the hilarious cameo by dom de luise who plays the duke of jersey highly recommended,1
4488,a boring movie about a miserable loser that s factotum in a nutshell matt dillon plays henry chinaski alter ego of author charles bukowski upon whose novel the film is based as we meet chinaski he may be a writer but he s certainly not a successful one he floats through life getting fired from one menial job after another and not caring a bit the fact that he s always drunk may have something to do with his not caring he meets a woman jan played by lili taylor and a relationship ensues chinaski moves into jan s apartment and now instead of getting drunk by himself he can get drunk with somebody else good times eventually he s had enough of this relationship so chinaski strikes out on his own unfortunately he still can t hold down a job so soon enough he s broke at this point marisa tomei shows up and for some reason her character laura decides to rescue this miserable drunken loser whom she doesn t even know we soon meet some of laura s acquaintances and the film veers off into a sort of bizarro world with this rather eclectic bunch soon enough tomei and friends are out of the picture and once again we re left with chinaski and his drinking and his miserable little life there s some more time spent with jan but mostly there s just time spent being a drunk unemployable loser and then the movie s over and not a moment too soon 94 minutes of absolute monotony and it seems infinitely longer as the movie drags on nothing happens nothing ever happens if you want to spend an hour and a half of your life watching matt dillon drink then this is the movie for you if you re looking for a compelling story well developed characters or any entertainment value whatsoever then you ve come to the wrong place dillon s performance actually isn t bad at all too bad the movie which surrounds him is in fact rather bad,0
17416,bonjour monsieur shlomi is simply a wonderful film writer director shemi zarhin has created a story unlike any other and cast it with such consistently fine actors that it remains a puzzle to me that this film has not become an audience favorite throughout the world it is intelligent emotional edifying and warm entertaining and in all categories it is a winner shlomi oshri cohen in a brilliantly understated performance is a 16 year old lad who takes care of his highly dysfunctional family his mother esti zakheim is about as distasteful a shrew as ever concocted and in a constant state of ill temper because of her husband cheated on her and because she is stuck working double shifts to support her ailing father in law ariek elias who as shlomi s grandfather is a bright funny wise loving old man who deeply cares for shlomi a married sister ziva rotem abuhab who periodically moves back in to the house because of constant spats with her husband who doesn t help her care for their infant twin sons his brother sasi assi cohen whose life is loud electric guitars braggadocio about female conquests and the favorite son of his mother stir this mixture and the result is the penultimate dysfunctional family unit shlomi cooks gourmet meals for them shops cleans house runs errands bathes and cares for this grandfather and in general leads a life of submission to a family that views him as a retard shlomi longs for a girlfriend and practically fails his school because of his lack of time devoted to caring for his family and a lack of concentration serendipitously his math teacher begin nisso keavia notes his natural mathematic genius on a discarded test and with the aid of the headmaster yigal nair the two encourage him to be tested and discover that he is a genius with dyslexia and arrange for him to try for a special school in haifa shlomi s mother will hear none of it but between fights with shlomi s absentee father albert iluz and confrontations with the teacher and headmaster they finally consent to his testing for the school meanwhile shlomi discovers a girl his age rona aya koren who has moved in next door and gradually the two become intertwined in a physical and intellectual relationship always in the background is the support of shlomi s grandfather and when the grandfather dies shlomi sets off on the journey to live his life for himself to realize his gifts to find his happiness the manner in which the family comes to grips with this is the peak of the movie and need not be revealed for the sake of loosing the power of the message the film is beautifully photographed the musical score is creatively lovely and the final result is one of exaltation of the human spirit highly recommended on every level in hebrew with english subtitles,1
24441,everyone is entitled to an opinion the only critic who counts is yourself i think this is a great movie much better than the original in caddyshack rodney dangerfield is funny but obnoxious he was asked to do the sequel but things got in the way jackie mason shows the saying that less is more he is funny but a man with real family issues a more rounded person it s no drama but a movie that makes you feel actually in some points you feel sorry for jackie mason especially when his daughter walks out on him it has a good soundtrack and overall a good sorry a good end to the series in the tv show alf alf says that he cried in terms of endearment the wife kate tanner played by anne schedeen also says he cried at caddyshack 2,1
21414,the one thing i really can t seem to forget about this movie is its beginning classic comedy brilliantly crafted i love it see it for yourself no spoilers here the sparring between devito and crystal also glows in this movie with devito as the perfect oppressed son one of my favourites highly recommended for fans of crystal,1
22665,this is the best 3 d experience disney has at their themeparks this is certainly better than their original 1960 s acid trip film that was in it s place is leagues better than honey i shrunk the audience and far more fun barely squeaks by the muppetvision 3 d movie at disney mgm and can even beat the original 3 d movie experience captain eo this film relives some of disney s greatest musical hits from aladdin the little mermaid and others and brought a smile to my face throughout the entire show this is a totally kid friendly movie too unlike honey and has more effects than the spectacular muppetvision,1
12673,the story told by the cranes are flying is not admittedly all that original young lovers are separated by war bad things happen to both we ve seen it many times before nonetheless we haven t seen it filmed this well with bold shots that take liberties to emphasize separation or destruction or hopelessness all the more remarkable coming from the soviet union and reason to conclude that tarkovsky is not the last word in modern era soviet cinema i was reading chekhov s three sisters the other day and chanced upon what may be the meaning of the title of this film in act 2 masha objects to the notion that we must live our lives without meaning or understanding masha surely mankind must believe in something or at least seek for the truth otherwise life is just emptiness emptiness to live and not to know why the cranes are flying why children are born why there are stars in the sky either you must know why it is you live or everything is trivial mere pointless nonsense likewise veronika has a hard time believing that the war and her and others sufferings have been pointless better to assign a meaning to live as if one s life is significant and not to give in to despair it is perhaps this thinking that prompts her to her final act in the film btw as a minor correction to one other comment here there may be a pattern of v s in the film though i hadn t noticed them myself but the first letter of veronika s name is not a further instance of this in the cyrillic alphabet her name begins with a letter which looks like an english b,1
7147,i like a lot of myrna loy movies this film was produced before her character actor personality was developed it would be an okay short film but seems to go on forever in it s complete form myrna loy it seems is told what to do with her acting and does the job that is about all you can say about her her gypsy character is shoddy and the film has many flaws such as the jewelry shop scene this film will probably be interesting to myrna loy fans but even as such is something of a disappointment,0
4261,opie tom gilson was my brother so i went to see the movie and i never looked at it again in all these years sorry it was bad i m told i have to write 10 lines so i ll put a little trivia in tom and tuesday weld were to be introduced in this picture and tom was told to take tuesday to the premiere but tom said no he was going with joan collins and he did and because he did only tuesday weld was introduced i found this very funny back then and still do the movie while the concept was a funny one and the actors in it were impressive but some how it just did nt come out funny the continuity was abstract at best it was like i was watching 2 different movies at the same time each running into the other sorry bob gilson,0
23116,first let me review the movie this movie creeps me out and i don t even believe in aliens however the movie has its flaws there are three acts to this movie act one is perfect it sets up the movie and really builds up the creep factor i must say the score is great everything is set up and it s set up perfectly act two begins when jillian playing sherry burton goes to the shrink they hypnotize her and she recalls the abduction act two ruins the film when the aliens show up screaming mad george did the effects for the aliens i must say they did a good job except with their depiction of the gray aliens no offense but the grays looked like inflatable door prizes on a side note i liked how they treated hypnosis in acts one and two if you paid attention you would notice that the husband and wife had two different memories in the husband s version of events the blue light zaps them and his wife says somebody s here or something like it it makes sense the husband is concerned for his wife someone may hurt her that s his issue however in her version of events she says help me she does not say somebody s here this also makes sense the aliens are after her wanting her husband to help and save her is her issue now back to the film act three turns the film into a gore fest it begins with a strange ultrasound procedure it s a typical gore fest but it does have a surprise ending i won t ruin it because it s actually an interesting development the dvd and commentaries takes itself too seriously but if you think wilford brimley saying horsesh is funny you might want to check it out in the cast interviews section now on to my praise of jillian mcwhirter i could only hope jillian will read this i had never seen her before but wow what a performance let me tell the rest of you this first of all this is supposed to be a serious film the details i will now describe may sound campy and fun like humanoids from the deep 1980 but it really isn t got that okay jillian is hot naturally good looking she is naked for a lot of the film a good thing unfortunately she is usually being assaulted terrorized and raped a very bad thing however she must act in a lot of this film naked she gets points for overcoming that she has to act happy sad horny afraid and physically hurt all in the span of a few moments the turnaround of emotion is astounding she has to cheer for joy when she learns she s pregnant she has to scream in terror when the aliens take out her guts she has to act very angry when her husband suggests that the baby isn t his she has to act like she s in denial saying nothing is wrong with her baby when her husband says otherwise a denial i should note that is really forced upon her by the aliens controlling her i am talking oscar caliber performance here then there is the rape scene it s disturbing but since it s just some rubber alien it s not too bad in this scene the alien is not a gray alien so i will describe it the alien has tentacles and it s kind of like a table jillian is on the table like part restrained by the tentacles by her head is the alien s head the alien s head is long and it flips down so that its head is now above jillian s legs then the alien s hey nanu nanu comes out of his forehead it s forehead sounds pretty campy right well jillian plays it straight and she pulls it off she has to act like an alien with its hey nanu nanu coming from its forehead is raping her and she pulls it off it s a very intense scene but that s not what makes it you see this scene is done in a flashback what makes the scene is jillian s performance recalling these events she is just lying in a hospital bed under hypnosis recalling the alien abduction but her acting here is more intense than the actual rape scene how many actors can pull off a performance in a scene that describes a rape that is more intense than the scene with the rape not many however jillian does it i could go on and on jillian if you ever read this i want you to know that i name withheld alias of megamanx 1 believe you are the best actress ever you are the best actress ever i could only hope you read this and take it with you always as for everyone else progeny 1999 is an okay to good film i would recommend it,1
18389,i m not a big fan of movie musicals annie was a stage show i loved but the movie was a flop the phantom of the opera movies and i believe there were three failed to match the weber staging but i loved this the dvd will take a place of honour among my keepers even though it s a movie adaptation it somehow captures the flavour and the atmosphere of live theatre bette midler always a treat is just exceptional in this role there s great music lots of laughs and even a tear or two i ve seen most of the big musicals of the eighties and nineties somehow i missed this one so there s no comparison to make but if it gets revived i shall be first in line for tickets but this movie is so good i ll be in the odd position of wondering if the stage production will measure up to the movie,1
6197,having avoided seeing the movie in the cinema but buying the dvd for my wife for xmas i had to watch it i did not expect much which usually means i get more than i bargained for but mamma mia utter utter cr i like abba i like the songs i have the old lps but this film is just terrible the stage show looks like a bit of a musical but this races along with songs hurriedly following one another no characterisation the dance numbers which were heavily choreographed according to the extras on the dvd are just thrown away with only half the bodies ever on screen the dance chorus of north europeans appear on a small greek island at will while the set and set up of numbers would have disgraced cliff richard s musicals in the sixties meryl see me i m acting streep can t even make her usual mugging effective in an over the top musical her grand piece the winner takes it all is meryl at the met note to director it should have been shot in stillness with the camera gradually showing distance growing between streep and brosnan some of the singing is awful karaoke on amateur night the camera cannot stop moving like bad mtv one can never settle down and just enjoy the music enthusiasm and characters but what is even worse is how this botched piece of excre has become the highest grossing film in the uk and the best selling dvd to boot blair campbell and new labour really have reduced the uk to zombies critical faculties anyone,0
2539,when i think about tv movies i always think of this film i have watched it a few times on sky movies it was terrible its been a long time since i have seen this film was just browsing and came across it on here s a microbiologist linda flemming goes on holiday with her son william flemming at this holiday resort kinda place they meet up with paul johnson taxi driver owns a bar and kathy johnson its like a weird romantic thing william starts to fall for kathy and paul falls for linda some guy passes out in a street he has some mark on his arm joseph joseph was a deep sea diver who on some dive saw a light or something and converted to religion says he will take care of this person there is a gap in my memory then there is a wide out break of the virus i think linda offers her help to come up with a cure kathy gets infected william notices a mark on kathy s arm with the virus also does joseph paul says some lines to joseph then joseph stumbles away the next time you see joseph he is cured some how that information is used to cure the infected then there is a beach party the end,0

9435,the only good thing about persepolis is the shadows created in the german expressionism style of animation and a hint of history this movie bored me it was about a woman dissatisfied with her culture who tries everything else and then goes back to her roots here she finds great discontentment once again and finally leaves for final to let everyone else in her country figure out the situation and what they will do now that she is not there to support them it comes to no conclusion and leaves us with a feeling that this woman has no loyalties mind you she is torn between cultures and doesn t have enough of a background it seems to figure what is important and real she is listening to ever so many voices and will most likely end up a world citizen of some kind than one with any ties to her native culture of iran the only thing i received from this movie was angst,0
9163,i am a gigantic fan of both koyaanisqatsi and powaqqatsi but this movie is just not good the reviewer below is entirely correct that the stunning imagery of the detroit station is the first and last memorable scene in the film i really really wish i had left after that instead of continuing to hold out hope throughout the film maybe my expectations were too high but i felt let down the score is almost completely a rehash of the previous two not necessarily a bad thing if you re a fan but there s only one piece that stood out to me as being fresh it was good enough though that i ll still probably check out the soundtrack but just keep this in mind if you see this film if you come to realize at any point that you re not enjoying it go ahead and split you won t miss a thing because it won t get any better i ll even give the executive summary here warning spoilers lots of shots of athletes that look almost good enough for a nike commercial shots of smiling people inexplicably dull frontal head shots of famous people s wax dummies wtf were they thinking here some giggling babies cuuuuute some bitchin photoshop effects some imagery that s meant to suggest a comparison between the flows of water information money and people i think and then a bunch of quick unrelated scenes of mass violence and then a bunch of stock space footage i could remake this movie in 10 seconds here s my pitch 2 seconds of a happy daddy with a shaved head and lycra biking shorts playing with a toddler playing with a kitten playing with string 5 seconds of that scene in network where the guy talks about messing with the elemental forces of nature and how money flows in money flows out 1 second of reginald denny getting brained with a brick and then 3 seconds of alan bean bouncing around on the moon there you go that s 88 minutes and 50 seconds of your life i just saved of course i d get a copy of after effects and apply a filter or two so it wouldn t look as blatantly stock as it is if steven soderbergh s reading this hey i won t even need much money for this project if you insist upon watching a movie about life as war i suggest bowling for columbine instead it may not have the pseudo intellectual veneer so fashionable among the black turtleneck crowd but at least it s funny,0
23882,i loved it it was really gruesome and disgusting i thought that the tearing of the human flesh was thoroughly provacative the way that it was depicting the human crucifix about jesus christ was really interesting the tearing about limbs and jaws was awesome brutally gruesome don t watch this if you have a weak heart you wouldn t be able to stand it,1
17053,i guess i do not have too much to add i found the comedy to still be funny after more than ten years since it came out the one thing that i did notice was the music during the dialogue to be distracting and often made the movie very hook than it should have been the use of songs is fine during the movie but the orchestral background is too busy too contrived and if the movie was ever to be edited for dvd i would seriously recommend that the background music be toned down to an almost inaudible level it has cheapened the overall feel for the whole film and i can see subconsciously why a lot of people have passed it up the film had a lot of levels working for it on the script plot and comedy level it is too bad that the producer and director felt they needed the musical schlock to enhance the mood now knowing this i find it hard to watch and i quietly curse whoever was involved with the musical editing in the film it had all the subtlety of a jackhammer,1
2472,ok this is one strange film fans of ed wood jr will appreciate the inventive techniques director george barry utilizes like stock footage and cheesy voice overs he can make a crack in the wall into a plot device there is more humor than horror here but i found it an uneven blend you will be laughing and crying and probably wondering why you got your hands on this barry explains in the introduction that filming began on this movie in 1972 and was completed in 1977 at a cost of 10 000 that s 59 months and 9 900 too much if you like your cheese on the campy side with vintage 70s gore you might find this an irresistible and freaky snack,0
4330,this movie was a dismal attempt at recreating a crucial time in english history the film version of cromwell s growing involvement in the war is marginally accurate but the overall historical accuracy of this movie was way off this film implies that the war was started over religious differences but the civil war was in no way catholic versus protestant both sides were protestant cromwell was never present at the battle of edgehill nor did he ever save the day the royalists did not win the battle ended in a draw as another reviewer has noted cromwell was certainly not one of the five members who were to be removed from the house and arrested overall this movie was decent the producers tried way to hard and it didn t turn out so great definitely could have been better,0
22395,i ve noticed that a lot of people are taking opera to task for the way betty reacts to the murders i think they are basing these complaints on how they imagine a normal person would react the thing is betty is not a normal person due to traumatic events in her childhood she has problems way way before the movie ever even starts and by the end of opera in my opinion she has become totally unhinged spoilers you have to keep in mind that when she was a very small child she witnessed her mother s lover commit at least one brutal murder while her sadomasochist mother was getting off watching it she was raised by a woman who achieves sexual release tied up watching girls get hacked slashed and strangled to death that does not make for a healthy home life i think it s pretty easy to conclude that her mother would have employed all sorts of emotional manipulation and negative reinforcement to ensure that her daughter never snitched on her it is also likely that at her impressionable age betty might have been deeply confused by what she saw is this just something that adults do etc betty obviously looks up to her mother i mean she s become an opera singer just like her if mommy likes it it can t be bad can it mommy can t be bad can she she couldn t tell the police on her mommy or this mysterious hooded fellow she associates with mommy betty has a lot of deep seated emotional issues her mind has for years been trying to block out the memory of what she saw her mother doing but it keeps coming to the surface manifesting itself in the form of horrible nightmares skull throbbing migraines a dependence on relaxation techniques and sexual frigidity she associates brutal violence bloody death with sex on a subconscious level there s an inner struggle between the part of betty that has confused murder sex and the part of her which believes these things to be wrong after she s seen her boyfriend murdered by the hooded man she calls the police yet is unwilling to give her name the part of her that thinks murder is wrong forces her to make the call but the part that is ambivalent won t allow her to admit personal involvement the ambivalent part of her takes control before she can go all the way so she walks away from the phone in the rain and when she s picked up by the director she s acting surprisingly calm not as upset as you would think a normal person would be because the part of her that s been blocking stuff since she was a child is trying its damnedest to block the horror of what she s just witnessed the state of affairs in her life all contribute to an impasse within betty s psyche her singing career is starting to bear fruit she s going to be a great opera singer like her mother was but is she going to become like her mother in all ways in the darker ways or will she be able to make her own path add this to the re emergence of the hooded man murdering everyone around her it s not until the hooded man kills daria nicolodi s character that betty really takes an active role in defeating the killer here s someone who loves betty who s supported her wholeheartedly in her emerging career who is in fact a maternal figure in betty s life now since mommy s dead imagine how terrible it would be to lose your real mother and then to see the woman who is the closest thing you have to a mother get shot through the eyeball i could go on but i won t the main gist of what i m saying is that the character of betty is a lot more complex than most of the reviewers on here have been willing to acknowledge opera is one of argento s best and not just for the visuals alone although they are truly magnificent and not just for the inventive murders although they are there is a depth here and attention needs to be paid,1
5915,shrieker is a full moon production i knew what to expect very little quality but i didn t expect this to be as painful as shrieker was to watch it s just awful bad acting confusing script and direction annoying characters i wanted to kill the whole thing was probably made in one week i ve seen episodes of charmed that were more complex and convincing than this cheapie it has the look and feel of an orphaned episode of a badly conceived tv series no one has ever seen it was a chore to watch and i could feel my mind getting dimmer and dimmer by the minute watching a movie shouldn t be this much hard work,0
11984,well i must admit when i saw the trailer for this movie i was looking forward to it i am generally a fan of light hearted romantic comedies and from the trailer thats the impression i got of this movie however i spent most of the movie waiting for the comedy to begin although there were a couple of amusing scenes in general the outlook of the movie was quite depressing i also found it difficult to fall in love with any of the characters as they all seemed a little underdeveloped the time which the director could have used exploring the characters taken up by a needless overuse of opera making the movie feel dragged out and slow all in all although there are some touching scenes the trailer is quite deceptive and i would only suggest you go watch this if there is really nothing else that tickles your fancy not fantastic and as i have said before bland,0
8306,this movie shows what you can create if you have a camera some spare paint and cardboard a toy ship a few friends who acted in community theater and the incorrect notion you can make a film the end result is an unwatchable time waster that you ll skip through unless you take it out of the dvd player and toss it through the window first the acting in the opening scene especially by the rotund lee morgan as captain and the toy ship crashing into the rocks before the credits is a good indicator of what you re in for with all the foam it looks like this special effect was shot in a kitchen sink i guess boyette figured he save some cash by washing the dishes at the same time in terms of bad cinema the funny thing is dungeon of harrow seems to have inspired maybe by coincidence the twist ending of manos the hands of fate yep it s the same lame i was the victim and now i take the mad villain s place ironic ending the bigger irony is that two inept talentless filmmakers could make two equally wretched texas filmed horror movies and get away with it monotone nerd russ harvey is a noble in a great family line why they were great is never broached boring us while lamenting the death of his family line and crest before his ship even crashes we re also treating to a droning narration throughout the film sadly we aren t so lucky his family s toy ship crashes into some styrofoam in a sink and he s washed ashore with his bloated captain and some woman conveniently deposited on a mad count s island meanwhile the count is visited by an evil spirit who dressed in a blackstone s magic kit outfit assaults him with various puppets spiders snakes bats all the icky stuff the count william mcnulty overacts worse than shatner and has a visibly difficult time keeping a straight face through the typical madman ranting i d be mad too if i had to be in this disaster the woman is promptly killed by the count s ferocious dogs and the two jerks are captured by his manservant the count accuses them of being pirates apparently his worst fear he slaps his manservant around a lot apparently his greatest joy fatboy gets tortured there s a woman who s a servant and one who s a nurse the rotting leper hag in a wedding dress countess in the dungeon she digs the nerdy noble and is the only effective creepy thing in the movie a lot of inane dialogue at a dining room table the blubbery captain gets killed while making a pathetic getaway aking to watching a sloth battle a pack of lions it s all an ugly haze to me i spent most of my time on the fast forward button anyway the jerk noble and nurse make a getaway and think they re going to be rescued by three guys in a rowboat on the lake yeah we re supposed to believe a lake is the ocean they don t since the nerd s hair turned gray and he scares the would be rescuers away honestly i think they simply took the opportunity to row away from this hideous film while the had the chance they head back to the castle the nurse starts rotting like the countess and your stomach by this time and we end with these two getting ready to descend into the dungeon of harrow blech i love old lousy horror films but they must have some sort of entertainment value i feel ripped off even at the low low price of 5 99 for this biscuit mystery science theater would have a tough time making this one fun i was taken in by a few nutty reviewers who claimed this film had atmosphere and some creepy moments wrong avoid this tripe at all costs and don t even waste a buck if you find it in a dollar bin somewhere this movie makes corman s the terror like like a masterpiece of horror and atmosphere,0
7239,the only redeeming quality of this film is that it shows bands and their music when it was changing in ny during 81 as for the film itself it has at least three major flaws first of all there is narration throughout the film which is not required at all in the few places where there is some explanation necessary just adding a little dialogue would have gone a long way secondly there was no obvious attempt to synchronize any of the audio in fact it is quite apparent that most of the dialogue was recorded later with no attempt to match the film the third flaw was in the ending i will not give the ending away for those brave souls that would endure the torture of sitting through the film but it commits a cardinal sin in screenwriting not worth the money or time it takes to see this unless you are a fan of one of the represented bands,0
24785,the frozen limits is a big screen vehicle for the artists known as the crazy gang they were a group of british entertainers who formed in the early 1930s in the main the group s six men were bud flanagan chesney allen jimmy nervo teddy knox charlie naughton and jimmy gold hugely popular in the variety halls the group were also darlings of the then royal family the plot here sees them as the wonder boys troupe who set off to seek their fortunes in alaska after reading about a gold rush in the newspaper only problem is is that when they finally get to red gulch it turns out they are 40 years too late i often cringe when i see the statement it s very british because it implies that those not of the british isles may struggle to get it the reason it bothers me is because in this www internet age i have garnered a ream of non british film loving friends who have been known to split their sides at the best of ealing will hay and the imperious terry thomas so then is it true that something such as the frozen limits is unlikely to be appreciated by a non british audience well yes it s true so much here is topically british but really it has to be said that the classic movie fan is pretty well versed in history and when all is said and done the visual mirth here is universal with the anarchic not so wild west make over an absolute winner a winner that has every chance of being more appreciated by an american audience now than it will be by a british audience not all the comedy works and in truth the big 6 are trumped big time by a film stealing moore marriott but there are skits and parodies here that deserve respect and a nod of approval from more illustrious comedy acts you are unlikely to nearly fall off your chair like i did because of an ovaltine gag but if you be a classic comedy film fan i feel sure that you will at the worst acknowledge there s some very talented people at work here now then dose the mounties always get their man 8 10,1
956,danger watch for falling spoilers boy was this a bad movie i know that they were going for a true love conquers all kind of thing but about all this film conquered was about 3 which felt more like 9 hours of my afternoon which i will never get back the movie is about two young lovers named kai and gerta who live in a remote town in a fantasy world kai is the much abused bellboy at a hotel owned by gerta s father at first gerta ignores kai s advances but she eventually warms up to him much to the disgust of you guessed it gerta s father as if this obstacle wasn t enough to overcome an evil snow queen shoots a shard of glass in kai s eye and he becomes a mean person treats gerta poorly kai is eventually taken to the snow queen s fortress which is the same set as the hotel just covered in ice because the good people at hallmark like to go all out and gerta sets out on a mission to get kai back along the way she runs into the 3 other seasons that are evil in their own special way but gerta escapes them with the help of some dull and forgettable characters she meets along the way all the while you will want to turn it off but can t force yourself to do it it s probably the most evil and most effective spells cast by the snow queen anyways i will spare you from the ending because anything you can think up in your head right now is probably better then how they ended it so in conclusion the snow queen is an incredibly boring movie which takes the fan out of fantasy,0
11309,this is so bad i don t know where to begin the lead role is a good starting point it is a supreme mary sue character that has few things in common with the original one from the book who was a bit more credible no this one is invincible infallible indomitable and insipid even beyond the overinflated standards that this chicks with swords era that our medias are spinning out of late she is a twenty something top model thin as a match yet rich already a leader in her academic field a kung fu master a natural sniper and seems to have enough authority to naturally trump anyone official like puny fbi agents she is god to balance it out she is supposed to be socially awkward due to her typically harsh upbringing that transformed her into a spock which gives us some delighted moments where she wonders what is star wars or american idol but yet when it s really important she can conveniently reveal herself as a top negotiator and diplomat because she is so superior ya know to top it out she is played by a wooden actress the more talented boreanaz serves as a faire valoir token for this construct acting as a bumbling comic relief and house watson in fact everything in there is a pop parody of better works like sherlock holmes csi and x files from which it tries to emulate the sexual tension between main protagonists it is however cheaper as this is delivered with all the subtlety of an elbow poke in the ribs but a million million poor factory girls will doubtlessly buy into it hence the crazy rating this turkey gets in fact the lowest common denominator goes a long way in this sad puppy resulting in titillating sex details from the legion of sidekicks that aim to pass it out as daring and trendy while the overall tone of the show carries an obvious neo conservative view on things story wise there s not much here to feast upon as crimes that always start out with some gruesome remains are resolved using non existent technology while the squints lovable but so wrong the women less than the guys goes on varied theories all of them futile as the main character has it all from the start and once it is established she goes out and then punch the guy typically a real tough hombre with a spin kick here and a slapper there the end,0
15838,this epic brings together a superbly gifted cast and crew a narrative depth superior to most novels wonderful music philosophy and a connection to life that i find difficult to explain to immerse oneself in die zweite heimat is for me akin to a spiritual experience similar to the awe one gets when looking at the stars in a clear night sky the language and use of both colour and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic impact the film inspired me to go to munich and visit some of the locations including the edgar reitz office from then on i vowed to improve my german skills after die zweite heimat i feel almost german as if i am in the head of the characters i also try to match the piano playing of henry arnold hermann but this is the one thing that will always elude me this drama is unparalleled and i have been fortunate to see it on bbc2 in the uk and sbs in australia the sequel heimat 3 is currently being filmed in germany,1
14806,it was probably watching this tv movie that got me interested in the debate as to whether anna was really tsar nicholas s daughter anastasia since seeing it i have made a point of watching various documentaries and also bought a book despite the evidence that has been discovered since the film was released i sometimes still think she was such is the power of amy irving s acting in this 2 parter which is somewhat liberal with the historical facts but packed to the brim with tear jerking drama and irving s totally convincing performance i was not consciously aware of irving before this though i must have seen her without realizing it in carrie another favourite film in anasasia i never felt for one moment that it s only a film for me this woman was anastasia and when part one ended with her in the railway carriage meeting members of the royal family i knew that come hell or high water i had to see the second part i just wanted to see how she would prove that she was who she claimed to be and as the story progressed i felt an intense hatred of rex harrison s character though i greatly admire him as an actor when i saw the movie listed again in the tv guide i convinced my mother that we should watch it and afterward she thanked me for doing so being almost as keen as i had been to watch part 2 then i bought the video and can totally recommend it anastasia is one of those rare tv movies that you simply must watch for the sheer enjoyment of watching the finest acting i have ever seen on tv and it doesn t really matter whether you believe the legend or not,1
13920,this is the most difficult movie i have ever seen the emotional content is horrific yet unforgetable a woman who is accused of being a political activist is brought in for questioning the whole movie revolves around her interrogation alan rickman and madeline stowe have intense and powerful roles for which they deserve oscars for their performances,1
6254,this is a movie with a wonderful concept but very weak writing it should never have been released with out at least three more re writes assuming it got any the story is too loosly held together and there are too many 90 degree turns in the story to make it a cohesive movie it would be great to see what a decent screen writer could do with the story,0
3581,crap i accidentally watched this film thinking that it was the swimming upstream that was released in 2003 i seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it shame on whoever gave this junk an award i thoroughly loathed this film in fact i didn t see it through to the end after an hour i could no longer stand it i am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such ba ad acting painful i rate it 1 star out of 10 an amateur could make a much much greater movie,0
2911,the plot was really weak and confused this is a true oprah flick in oprah s world all men are evil and all women are victims,0
16800,as a local performer i thought that grease showcased what broadway producers are looking for and it highlighted a small bit of the acting population although my favorites did not win but came in second i enjoyed comparing myself to them and seeing what i liked and where i could improve as a performer they brought in olivia newton john because she is the obvious link between the broadway production and television audiences they sang songs from the movie hopelessly devoted et al because these songs will be included in the new production i agree with the earlier comment made that the b way cast looks so much older but you must bear in mind that these are people who have been on broadway and worked their tails off to be there if the entire cast was green and fresh then i believe that would have compromised the casting process by which producers choose their talent,1
13311,i can t really criticize this film it is literally the first film i ever remember seeing and lead to a lifelong love of science fiction and horror films and prehistoric animals fortunately seeing it again years later it held up fairly well rod cameron plays a big game hunter whose last safari was wiped out by mammoths no one believes him including his best friend played by cesar romero whose brother was among those killed and rod cameron was the only survivor the film was shot in india and has some good scenery the acting is on a high level i don t believe rod cameron cesar romero and marie winsor ever turned in a bad performance the mammoths when they finally arrive are fairly effective the ending also has an unusual twist particularly for a 1950 s science fiction film definitely worth seeing,1
13028,superbly crafted low budget thriller with more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at and plenty of ghoulish humour along the way as well the cast play it very well although richards self centered movie director is a bit hard to take at times the tiny two scene cameo by sir alec guinness oozing menace as the crime czar of moscow is simply the icing on the cake well worth repeated viewing but not on dark nights when you re all alone,1
21331,i was ten years old when i saw subspecies i instantly had the hots for michael watson and laura tate they really do have some great on screen chemistry in the earlier parts of the movie i ordered a copy back in 1993 from full moon and i learned this ion and rosa the servants have much bigger roles in the screenplay along with the king what most people don t know is that there was an alternate sequence that was supposed to occur in the ending scene michelle and stefan get cornered into a room and michelle has the idea for stefan to make her a vampire to help fight off radu and her demonic controlled ex friends however for some reason or another that scenario never made it on camera another scene in the script that can be confirmed from the original trailer shows stefan drinking blood from a wolf or actually in the trailer you see him coming up with blood on his chin this movie gets a 9 because it s one from my childhood and i have fond memories attached to the characters even though my favorite characters were stefan and michelle i think anders hove s radu is pure feeling evocative acting so much feeling in his work there,1
19726,yes they finally got it down to perfection what a great idea a refreshing exploitation epic for generation x whether they know it or not after disasters like sgt kabukiman nypd and getting screwed by blockbuster our hero lloyd kaufman just decided to go for it stop catering to distributors and let troma be all the troma it can be lloyd would make this one the most unapologetic outlandish and downright hilarious troma movie yet this time lloyd takes shakespeare s love story turns it inside out tromatizes it and adds that long lost entertainment value it was always lacking entertainment value such as lemmy kilmister the narrator debbie rochon the cook joe fleishaker the fat guy and of course brutal mutilations and toilet humor tromeo and juliet is the definitive edition of a rather lackluster story and the crown jewel of the troma universe years ago in tromaville n j business partners monty que and cap capulet start a film company called silky films which would produce supposedly tasteful soft core films monty considers cap his friend but cap is out to screw the poor sucker out of his share of the company on paper and in books it appears that monty gave away his life s work for free fast forward to mid 90 s manhattan we have two families who are extremely displeased with one another it s to the point that they re just looking for a reason to take a limb or preferably a life monty has a son tromeo nephew benny they with their friend murray martini who s just a little too excited about all the carnage wage war on the incestuous capulets except monty he s too drunk to care like in the original there is a confusing situation leading to tromeo falling for cap s daughter who he has never met or never even knew about unfortunately cap is a sadistic pervert who not unlike tromeo s dad has a thing for the bottle and this would of course lead to daddy s little chenshaw melon being physically and emotionally abused and molested and kept in a plexiglas cage off and on depending on how foul of a mood cap is in cap is also forcing his vegetarian daughter to marry london arbuckle a billionaire butcher who would make just about anyone uneasy with or without the raisin loaf with all these inconveniences the young lovers feel that eloping would be the best decision but how will this effect the big feud it might or might not go a little something like the original but figuring out how this one ends up is just simply not going to happen you ll never see it coming the one with leo is downright sleep inducing compared to tromeo juliet but if watered down over directed big budget hollywood garbage is what you ve been programmed to go for then by all means go for it but if you re in the mood for something a little more colorful something that really packs a punch and doesn t follow the normal movie pattern and if you happen to have a rather abnormal sense of humor then you just might not hate this movie tromeo and juliet gives the finger to all that is mainstream full blast exploitation with as much mean spirited humor as anything from a young john waters along with some badass acting tromeo and juliet flaunts a thunderous score which includes the legendary motorhead and not to mention much input from james gunn that really brought this one together for more awesomeness from james gunn check out lollilove and for more excellence from lloyd kaufman check out his next vision terror firmer tromeo and juliet is jaw droppingly priceless exploitation for the 90 s brought to us by the one and only king of the b movies thank s lloyd 10 10,1

9361,how poor is this movie well i got it less than two months ago and can hardly remember what it was about i also paid a 1 for this on dvd the old story of put a new cover on the box and some fool will buy it syndrome all i really recall it that the cast ran around a lot use of cars must have been too above the budget and that a vampire was involved then again guess you could know that from the film s title straight to video rubbish or straight to cheap jack dvd as it is now this stuff will be in the bargain bins at rental shops supermarkets and charity shops until the death of the sun only cockroaches will rule the earth but this trash will still be around god bless the dawn of the dvd age,0
10927,i m no director or writer or anything related to a movie but watching more than 1 movie everyday has given me the idea of what is a good movie or not so here it is the quick and the undead is a rip off of the quick and the dead i was thinking that it could be a little bit of a parody of a cool movie with lots of starts in it but oh no i was really in for an very big disappointment to put it simply the movie sucks i m a big fan of gore movies but this one just gives you gore here and there but they are not that consistent but i have to give them credit in creating gruesome characters which has given me a little bit of squirm if you re a big fan of zombies watch this if you re not better look for other rob zombie films,0
15323,this is ten times better than who wants to be a super model on bravo i think it is more true to the business tyra is strong and sensitive at the same time and is able to get the most out of each aspiring model the photos look for depth in each of the models in personality and beauty strength and demure attributes and the ability to endure and work for what they want i enjoy seeing tyra s personal experience brought into the photo shoots and on the runway i don t always agree with the judges decision s or tyra s comments and at least one of the winners i feel did not deserve to win but this is just a show and every girl on there is very lucky to have this chance,1
15245,tony hawk s pro skater 2x isn t much different at all from the previous games excluding tony hawk 3 the only thing new that is featured in tony hawk s pro skater 2x is the new selection of levels and tweaked out graphics tony hawk s pro skater 2x offers a new career mode and that is the 2x career the 2x career is basically tony hawk 1 career because there is only about five challenges per level if you missed tony hawk 1 and 2 i suggest that you buy tony hawk s pro skater 2x but if you have played the first two games you should still try this one overall there really isn t anything new but it is still very fun to go through the game hopefully this review benefits your needs graphics 7 out of 10 overall the clean visuals isn t really one of tony hawk s pro skater 2x s main characteristics the atmosphere has been changed around a lot from tony hawk 1 and 2 and the character models look a little bit improved when you look back to tony hawk s pro skater 1 and 2 on the old ps1 the thought that those old graphics are ugly run through your head in tony hawk s pro skater 2x the graphics are rendered a lot better the character models are no longer filled with jaggys the textures are more smooth but not to the farthest extent tony hawk s pro skater 2x s visuals do not compare to tony hawk 3 s graphics but activision probably didn t want to make tony hawk s pro skater 2x have extraordinary graphics overall the graphics deserve an average score of 7 because they did not put the full power of the xbox to use in here graphics are nice and clean that s all i have to say sound 8 out of 10 the sound effects don t deliver much to the imagination but the skateboards popping off of the ground sound great the main reason why i gave the sound factor a rating was because you are not obligated to listen to the below average tony hawk soundtrack because there is a custom soundtrack feature the sound effects sound a lot better than the sounds in tony hawk 1 and 2 mainly because it is more clearer and just the fact that everything sounds great one of the main reasons why i bought this game is because of the custom soundtrack the grind sound effects still sound the same as the first two games did just a little tweaked out one of the major problems of the sound factor is the fact that if the song is over it will not proceed to the next track the song that you have just listened to will just play over again i don t like the in game soundtrack but like i said you are not obligated to listen to it controls 10 out of 10 the controls are the best part of tony hawk s pro skater 2x the control set up is marvelously comfortable and easy to get used to back in the playstation days people thought that the controls were the best ever but it looks like 2x has done a better job with the xbox control surprisingly it is very easy to use the control stick to execute tricks activision has done great work with tony hawk s pro skater 2x s controls they have made the xbox controller the best for tony hawk games you will not be disappointed with the control style and that is a guarantee game play 10 out of 10 excluding the fact that tony hawk s pro skater 2x is basically tony hawk 1 and 2 put together the game play is still unbelievably fun the game play factor has been changed around a bit this time you get a lot more air than in the first two games and it is a lot easier to perform tricks in tony hawk s pro skater 2x each character has three career modes consisting of tony hawk 1 career tony hawk 2 career and the 2x career tony hawk 1 career is rather easy because in the first game you get nothing for air the tony hawk 2 career delivers the same amount of difficulty as the playstation version did the only amount of difficulty that applies to the 2x career is finding out where all items are but after you ve done that 2x career is no hard at all in the 2x career there is a total of 3 levels and the first two levels consist of finding the secret tapes collecting s k a t e and doing whatever else is required for that particular level the third level out of the three is the competition level where you have to get a certain amount of points to get the gold in the first two levels the secret tapes and collecting the letters s k a t e are featured in both of them overall tony hawk s pro skater 2x still maintains the old tony hawk s pro skater vibe story fun factor 10 out of 10 tony hawk s pro skater 2x is by far the most funnest game on xbox today i have played tony hawk s pro skater 1 and 2 and back then i didn t like them but for some reason tony hawk s pro skater 2x is really fun there really isn t much to say except that tony hawk s pro skater 2x is by far the best game on xbox today one problem is that if you ve already gone through the game once you will play it a couple more times but it will be repetitive replay value 10 out of 10 tony hawk s pro skater 2x delivers a high amount of replay value there is a lot of cheats to unlock and a lot of character videos overall tony hawk s pro skater 2x has lots of replay value mainly because it is so fun best feature you are not obligated to listen to the crappy in game soundtrack worst feature the custom soundtrack is a bit messed up final statement lots of people have complained in the past that they didn t like tony hawk s pro skater 2x because there is nothing new but they should stop complaining because your getting a lot of game for 50 00 graphics 7 out of 10 sound 8 out of 10 control 10 out of 10 game play 10 out of 10 story n a fun factor 10 out of 10 overall score 9 out of 10,1
2612,this movie was by far the worst movie i ve ever had to endure i couldn t believe that they tried to pass it off as a serious movie it was so bad i couldn t even laugh at it s pathetic attempt to entertain me if you want cheesy horror that you can laugh at rent dr giggles instead,0
3943,this is the first time i feel the need to comment on imdb to write some sort of a review and as it so often happens it s not because of a really excellent film but a truly appalling one take the narrating style the youngest might relate to the max payne video game series a cast of virtually unkonwns which is not a bad thing in itself poor dialogs some dark scenes but not many enough and make a film out of it don t worry about the bad acting the length way too long the lack of immersion the lead character has to be one of the lest interesting i ve seen in a long time couldn t care less if he died or the often ridiculous solutions they find to certain problems the lead character finds himself in i wouldn t have written anything if it hadn t been for another review here giving it 10 stars i gave it four but maybe three is closer to what i feel about it not only do i not wish to see it again but the mere thought of it takes me dangerously close to wanting to kill myself oh and a so called noir film is nothing without a good soundtrack not the case here the ending song sounds like it was more suitable to a western movie it s not romance it s not action it s not noir it s not good that would be my review if it weren t for the minimum of 10 lines,0
11151,this movie was completely stale and uninspired the central premise of this movie was basically a bunch of stereotypical black people sitting around a barbershop exchanging painfully unfunny repartee i did not laugh one time during the entire movie i could have sat in any barbershop in america and have heard this banal banter and maybe have even come out with a decent haircut i cannot understand why this mess got any favourable reviews much less why so many people have wasted money on this none of the characters here were funny or worth caring about i really didn t care whether the rival barbershop across the street would cause nappy cutz to go out of business don t waste your money on this one folks as that is the only way to get hollywood to stop churning out these shambolic pieces of rubbish 1 out of 5,0
16051,a formula for murder isn t a well known giallo but that isn t to say it s not a very good one the film is directed by alberto de martino the man behind cult classics such as the antichrist and blazing magnums the film was released late on in the giallo cycle but more than stands up to many of the films released around the golden period in the early seventies despite a lack of logic in some areas the film works mainly due to the competent way it mixes argento style death scenes with some genuinely surprising plot twists and a host of well defined characters the film is perhaps not as exciting overall as many other films in the genre but this is more than compensated for by the assured way that the central situation is fed to the audience and the tension resulting from that the plot begins by showing a fake priest raping a young girl named joanna before pushing her down a flight of steps we then fast forward several years and the girl is now a woman who is unfortunately in a wheelchair she is being trained for a sports event by craig a man who also has romantic designs on her however his proposal isn t met with glee by joanna s personal assistant who also has romantic designs on her the film features a plot twist half way through that makes up the backbone of the movie and while it s not exactly logical it s good to watch and hints that you re in for an interesting movie director alberto de martino is clearly not afraid to show a few outrageous gore scenes and the best of which in this film features a priest being battered to death by a spade and i personally wouldn t hesitate to name that sequence as one of my favourite giallo murder scenes the plot can be a little uneven at times but generally the action is very good the director spends what seems like an eternity on the conclusion to the film but it s absolutely packed with tension and the way that it plays out is good in that it takes advantage of all the plot points that have gone before it the musical score taken from fulci s the new york ripper works well in this film also and breaking a giallo tradition de martino s film also features some rather good acting performances from cult veteran david warbeck and christina nagy in her only feature film role overall this film isn t one of the easiest giallo s to come across but its well worth tracking down and comes recommended to fans of this sort of film,1
2703,few videos in recent history have been as amateurishly produced as this one at least none that have been released by such a reputable distributor every frame of this film is a plaguerism of better films of the past the word cliche is given new meaning by a talentless writer director who should reserve his imagination for lesser masturbatory efforts that don t victimize film viewers assisting in the amateur night horror effort is a number of less than capable technicians who contribute poor cinematography and laughable make up and special effects unfortunately the one or two of the amateur actors in the film who display a hint of talent that will go unnoticed due to the reputation that this atrocity will produce,0
14733,the slightly overlong set up episode of the previous week paid off in no uncertain terms with an episode that hit the heights there was a certain deus ex machina flavour to the resolution of the cliffhanger but it was a good start for all that as is now common with this doctor the moral ethical and emotional considerations of his actions were centre stage they were always there in the classic series but they were a side issue to be glossed over when the doctor was in the heat of battle this regeneration even says sorry to a cyberman during the battle this episode finally shows mickey embracing the heroic side that had been hinted at in previous episodes his journey from zero to hero is complete and it has been an utterly convincing one with scares humour and scenes that brought a lump to your throat this episode had everything after much consideration i can finally say that the new series betters the classic series in every single respect coming from a die hard whovian you can get no better recommendation than that,1
19880,everyone who worked on this film did an amazing job this is honestly one of the best lesbian films i ve seen in a long time the acting writing cinematography music visuals everything was top notch as an avid fan of the genre both lesbian films and gymnastics i was so unbelievably pleased by this film it truly gave me so much more than i expected across the board hearing the q a with the cast and crew was great the lead actress has so much positive energy and is so humble and gracious it s a pleasure to see people who can be talented and not lose sight of what s really important and the writer did a hell of a job as well as directing and the editing was awesome thanks so much for making a great film thanks also for the line about if you re going to slap a label on yourself it would be bisexual i m so tired of movies where characters who have a relationship with both sexes get passed off as gay or straight it s wonderful to see bisexuals getting recognition for existing and being part of the gay community and it was nice that labels weren t even necessary at all in this film what an ending just when i thought it couldn t give me more it did beautiful work and my applauds to all i will spread the word this is definitely a film not to be missed,1
20963,of course going into it one would expect it to be a typical stupid t a flick and it is but it really does have some fairly well thought out humorous moments given the era in which it was made and the obvious exploitation aspect it is still one of the better b comedies of the time while watching this movie you will see quite obviously the inspiration for many of the scenes in revenge of the nerds and numerous other films of the same genre most of the acting is horrible and way over the top but that s exactly what i expect in a movie like this what it lacks in the way of acting ability it more than makes up for with its camp value and complete disregard for anything of merit the amazing thing about this movie is that there was obviously some money that went into it films like this made today just don t have the same style if you can turn your brain off and turn your sense of humor up for an hour and a half you will enjoy this flick i dare anyone to not find at least something in this movie that they think is funny if not hilarious,1
1214,zzzzzzzzzzzz this one came directly from the jaws cookie cutter mold with some other bizarre cliches thrown in for good measure i was interested in seeing this after finding a still from it in a book about italian horror films and wow i guess i got what i deserved very slow moving and talky much of this killer shark movie takes place on land which isn t really that surprising it seems like the only method they had of showing a shark is through shots of a shark in an aquarium the shark is never in the same frame as any of the actors and that s too bad most of the characters are so annoying that you actually wish they would get eaten the plot concerns a group of four kids who meet up with a mysterious indian on the beach one day while roasting weenies the indian for some reason gives them an ancient artifact that will allow them to track an ancient evil that assumed the form of a monster shark to attack their tribe supposedly because they were too good at fishing the ocean and the ocean god was worried they would take all the fish or something like that it s a good thing too because wouldn t ya know it years later a monster shark appears and starts gobbling up people in the sleepy seaside community when one of the four guys are eaten by the shark the remaining three are determined to kill the thing especially since big shocker here the authorities have killed a shark and they think the threat is over yawn the obligatory death scenes are unbelievably tedious and you can see them coming a mile away my favorite was the girl who has a fight with her boyfriend while they re sitting in a van then jumps out and says i m going for a swim immediately to be gobbled up by the waiting shark they had a lot of nerve calling this film deep blood since you hardly see any just cloudy water the actors handle their cliched roles like they re all thumbs and there is even a hilarious subplot involving a greasy rocker type bad boy who threatens our goody goody heroes then turns good in the end to help kill the shark it took me a really long time to find this film it is rather obscure so i don t think there s any danger of too many people wasting their time on this however if you should be lured into it don t say you weren t warned,0
11506,you can generally ask two questions concerning 80 s low budget horror films and this demon wind in particular 1 is it a good film no 2 is it a fun film you bet demon wind is a gruesomely filthy and nauseating tale filled with cheesy make up effects and nasty violence the story is pretty much non existent and involves a group of young people revealing the horrible secrets of one of the groups ancestors apparently his grandparents used to live in a devil worshiping neighborhood and evil in the form of demons and fog still dwells around there but i got to hand it to this film from start to finish it breathes morbidity the diabolical undertones the playful gore and the relatively decent acting all together make this film raise high above the mainstream uninspired 80 s slashers for sure it shows some creativity and guts literally where other productions from this decade fall into routine and oblivion more easily this creators clearly got inspired by the success of the evil dead and perhaps even lamberto bava s demons but what the heck it s fun and made with lots of enthusiasm although this film does have a pretty high what the f standard at times especially near the end when flashbacks and laser shows are happily being mixed and what the hell is the story on those two wannabe magicians nonetheless demon wind gets my recommendation if your likes aren t too high concerning crap horror,0
11771,snowball express from the disney studios isn t quite as dated as some of their output from this era there are no hippies or hot rodders just dull as dishwater dean jones inheriting a ramshackle hotel ski resort from a deceased relative when jones and family pull into a sleepy colorado town the folks who give them directions looking like extras from deliverance are curiously vague about the hotel we expect it to look like a one room shanty but actually the accommodations are very nice jones teenage daughter has a sour look on her face throughout which doesn t prevent one of the local yahoos from leering at her and of course clumsy pop dean jones is a regular stumblebum on the slopes leading to a lot of pratfalls in the slush perhaps this square scenario might ve benefited from some magical whimsy for this script is a frozen stiff from,0
21285,what an awesome mini series the original traffik completely stole me away from anything else that was on far more engaging than the american remake the original traffik boasts an amazing cast formed of lesser known actors to north american audiences juliette binoche being the mainly recognizable actress who plays a drug addicted teenaged daughter of a government official but it s not star power that carries this film though i enjoyed the american version i felt it was dimmed by the famous americans in the picture unfortunately i saw the american version before i found the original bbc mini series of course there were no picture filters lush locales and the big name stars director however the grit and grime of europe through the drugworld perfectly compliments the impending sense of danger which permeates throughout this film the problems such as getting addicts off of drugs by giving them more poor anti drug campaigning and the resistance of foreign governments to assist with destroying their drug cultivators from within all make traffik bold immersive and horrific all at the same time the truly incredible portions of the movie all come from pakistan my god i never knew how bad the problem really was over in europe even all over for a real education on the problems of drugs beyond how they affect the human body you must watch both this and the american version each show one very clear and undeniable fact those countries which are leaders in the eyes of the world have a culture that has led to the death and suffering for many drugs are worse than war they work in the shadows the dark secrets of any successful society,1
1853,jerry angell owner of zombie horror s finest mullet returns for more undead action in the sequel to director todd sheets atrocious home made gore fest zombie bloodbath this time around jerry plays a sleazy low life thug who along with his equally despicable partner in crime some escaped convicts several teenagers and a bunch of screaming girls comes face to face with a horde of shambling flesh eating corpses obviously having learnt zilch about improving his craft in the two years since zombie bloodbath sheets delivers another shoddy mess of a film that somehow manages to be even worse than the original a feat that i thought was almost impossible to achieve the acting is uniformly lousy the effects amateurish and cheap most of the gore appears to be nothing more than a selection of offcuts offal and blood from the local butcher s shop the story incomprehensible as far as i could fathom the zombies rise from the dead because a scarecrow commands them to and the direction frustratingly laden with cheap looking video effects and completely meaningless cuts to black and white and as if that wasn t enough to convince you of this film s complete lack of redeeming features the simply mind bogglingly moronic ending should do the trick the few remaining survivors stumble upon an abandoned truck that conveniently happens to have a stash of flesh eating bacteria laying on its passenger seat just the thing for dissolving the undead but strangely enough not at all detrimental to the living,0
1252,this movie was really bad first they didn t even follow the facts for it half of the movie was made up and it was more about the deputy whose mother was one of ed gein s victims the acting was horrible except for the guy playing ed gein but its not hard to mess up playing a weird guy though i think it was horrible i gave it a three because they started it off with actual crime photos that was the best part of the movie as soon as the introduction of the movie was finished the movie went downhill the writer of this movie tried to spice it up but it didn t need to be the story of ed gein is interesting enough without falsifying information,0
2878,well the artyfartyrati of cannes may have liked this film but not me i am afraid if you like the type of film where shots linger for so long that you wonder whether the actor has fallen asleep or the cameraman gone for lunch then it may be for you a large part of it is like this with short sojourns into the realm of unpleasantness i did not find it shocking nor disturbing as some other reviewers have simply a little distasteful and pointless the only reason i did not give this one star is that the acting is commendable ans the film is fairly well shot the plot however has little to recommend a large part of the film just shows a grumpy woman teaching or listening to piano which might appeal to some people but lest you think this is harmless enough be prepared for some snatches of pornography and sexual violence just to wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth not recommended,0
8702,this is a stereotype plot a young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his fighting school this leads to separation from the fighting school and naturally he finds a strange new master to teach him to fight the fights are not of high standards they are way too simple in a way that 1 1 is simple to every adult the fighter has trained and enters the ring but does not do what he trained and gets an ass kicking the coach yells do this and do that with no success and after some more of this ridiculous beating he suddenly does what he is told and hits his opponent once this results in a turning point in the fight although our hero has been taking a beating of his life up until that point think about the rocky movies and you ll have a good point of reference of how much beating he really takes the fights are also shot poorly there final thing that screws this film up is the stupid romance cheesy music and awkward moments are not what i call entertainment these guys really could have made some quality entertainment but the director wasn t up to the task or the other crew in my opinion maybe they had a small budget i don t know but what matters in the end is that this movie is bad and deserves the rating of 3 out of 10,0
3420,jack frost 2 the worst horror film i have ever seen why 1 the premise is well beyond ridiculous 2 the damn thing doesn t even have legs to move on 3 it escapes after being completely submerged in anti freeze first film 4 get this it travels all the way across an ocean of salt water to a tropical island to get revenge on the sheriff that did him in the first film 5 killer snowballs i have yet to be drunk enough to see ginger dead man so as of the writing of this jack frost 2 hold the distinction of being the stupidest horror film ever even surpassing the inaneness of it s predecessor if you can believe that,0
6767,well acted yes very well i must say even though i don t speak chezck nice cinematography but the script is lame really lame a predictable soap opera in which you know exactly everything that is going to happen ok maybe the ending isn t as predictable but is it any good it is one of those films that you have the feeling that have seen already and forget about the day after i just got a note from imdb saying that my comment was not long enough that s really sad because i have no idea of what else to say about this movie which actually says a a lot about it don t you think the thing is it has no soul and no originality compare this movie with barrio or riff raff shot more than ten years ago or the extraordinary recently shot the child it s sad to see that this is a much worse film,0
14445,i watched this movie the other night and i have to admit it was quite possibly the best film of this generation turns out i wasn t born until 1988 but i can relate to this motion picture like cary grant can relate to having an std or burt reynolds to being a burnout marky mark did not decline in awesomeness after his brief stint in new kids on the block which i will from here on refer to as the best band in the world aka bbw like it s totally a morality tale about fargin trannies an poop so pay attention i love all y all and continue to support marky msrk because he needs us now more than ever he s the only boyee who survived the de sharted,1
4061,piece of junk would ve given it a 0 if i could have animation is good but not quite good enough storyline is absolutely the most ridiculous i ve ever come across and that s saying a lot this movie tried so hard to be interesting but failed miserably it s almost as if the writer started one story then got another idea and attempted to mesh the two together don t waste your time on this believe me you ll be as ticked off with yourself as i was the only actor of any note in this was james woods and his part was peripheral at best i m all for doing stuff that is edgy that pushes the envelopes but this simply didn t cut it,0
10150,this movie changed my life hogan s performance was nothing short of incredible and i still haven t recovered from his exclusion from the 1990 oscar nominations and as brightly as the hulkster shines in this movie you can t discount the brilliant writing and direction that vaults this masterpiece in to the highest strata of achievement in film if you haven t seen this movie drop what your doing right now and get yourself a copy i guarantee it will blow your mind and if you don t like it then i just have one question for you watcha gonna do when the 24 inch pythons and hulkamania runs wild on you,0
22097,five years after she teamed up with james cagney in the public enemy mae clarke makes another appearance this time as his fianc e with cagney s character on the other side of the law it seems like she was calling more of the shots in their relationship as well trying to get johnny cave to be a little more practical with his money and his career you had to figure they d get back together after she gave him the boot for challenging her crooked boss those things have a way of working out in pictures i got a kick out of watching cagney in this one i usually do and here he looked like he might have auditioned that characteristic shoulder shrug move that he used to good effect in angels with dirty faces portraying rocky sullivan it was right after he threw cavanaugh robert gleckler out of his office during the first attempt at bribing the new weights and measures boss he turns to the camera and hitches up as if entirely pleased with his response to the crook very cool it s my understanding that this wasn t one of cagney s warner films but it might as well have been warner s often took up the cause for the common man and the expose of crooked merchants and the politicians who protected them would have been right up their alley you also have those great new york city street scenes depicting cars and shops of the era with home made signs pricing flour at eighteen cents a pound hey how about the furniture store selling the living room set for a hundred eighty nine dollars you might get a single stick chair for that price today best part of the picture just might be that meat counter scene when cagney james burke aloysius and the butchers play catch with an underweight chicken one of the film s lighter moments but you get an idea how tense people can get when they re caught cheating same with the truck driver who s pressured by johnny into signing for an accurate delivery he just wasn t used to doing that all in all a nice diversion from cagney s more typical gangster presence even if not up to the standard of his feature films it s easy enough to obtain as one of a handful of public domain cagney pictures out there and often found in relatively inexpensive compilations,1
11302,marar a really disappointed me i can t consider it as a bad movie but the development just seemed too rushed and non believable for it to evoke any emotions dr ferm n displays some unprecedented bizarre behaviour out of a passion that one can t really understand where it was born from i mean how many times does he ever have a conversation with marar a maybe once also marar a never appeared to be a real character instead more like a film stereotype that just needed to be in the movie or else another title was needed some of the best acting came from a role that wasn t really important to the story that of marcial the sub intelligent yet humble drunkard of course the scenery the cultural tidbits of the canary islands and other wow moments were interesting but the movie fell short of a documentary in case this was its real intention and most importantly as a solid drama,0
7102,maybe it s because i m no fan of the comics but if the comics are of the same quality as the movie it s hard to believe there are any but this has to be one of the worst movies ever made non existent plot laughable acting dumb dialogue this movie is so bad that it hurts a lot that some people actually gave this one 10 10 is an insult to any good or at least mediocre or at least bad movie if you hate yourself then watch tank girl on another thought if you hate yourself that much maybe you should just commit suicide my rating 34 10,0
20456,slick tidy and well made old school version of how a great international thriller should be made determined to nail a feared global terrorist who is known as carlos the jackal jack shaw donald sutherland without limits space cowboys a cia operative and his israeli counterpart amos ben kingsley gandhi sexy beast get a noble naval officer annibal ramirez aidan quinn music of the heart to become carlos and use him in a daring plot to get the kgb to kill the real carlos because he took an offer from the cia sutherland and kingsley are both good here but the movie really belongs to quinn here who embodies himself here in a dual role director christian duguay and cinematographer david franco provide another great asset of the film here with hitchcockian like suspense and great sights of the world,1
12198,there are times when less than halfway through a movie i start to wonder what the creators were thinking that made them decide not to burn every reel of footage and instead release a movie that has no real merit of any kind and i mean any kind this movie doesn t even hold up as made for cable porn in fact heaven s tears is completely and utterly boring and at times a bit disturbing in its naivete the girl who is as i recall eighteen masturbates while thinking of an older nazi who hit her with a car the bumping into her in the hall as a way of introducing ourselves syndrome from sitcoms and robert zemekis films then on their second or third meeting get this he is the shy one the one who is resistant to the girl s sexual advances and yet all she has to say is i m old enough i m want to and he takes her to bed then after sleeping with this girl he hardly knows he feels completed as if he could die right there in the bed with her and he d have lived a full life it s like lolita without a shred of social and personal commentary the cinematography is the most boring part of the movie no interesting angles or originality at all not even for the sex scenes which are supposed to be the main draw for these kinds of movies the masturbation scene is just a camera circling the girl s bed very fake looking as if it s on a stage and it s interspliced with her fantasy of the man taking a shower in a waterfall the i am completed scene is just a close up of the girl s right side head down to her breasts with the guy on top of her and it s the same shot for the whole time even though there are repetitious cuts to a fairly unrelated scene of the nazi s older sister who has some kind of incestuous crush on him she s ridiculous and silly so it doesn t matter i think the whole thing lasts five to ten minutes and it s neither enlightening nor arousing,0
23386,i did enjoy watching squire trelane jerk around the crew in this episode though after a while the whole thing just seemed a little too long sure the histrionics were kind of funny for a while and the ending was a pretty good way to wrap the whole thing together i think the problem was that i enjoyed seeing trelane when he was full of bravado and fun the fun seemed to vanish when trelane became vindictive and nasty talk about a mood killer going from the obnoxious but affable host to the guy sentencing kirk to death but despite this the episode was enjoyable and worth my time for die hard trekkies this is a must see for others it s just a pretty run of the mill one,1
7206,i got hold of a discount copy of this i had seen it several years ago my only recent experience had been mystery science theatre where it was soundly spoofed one never really gets a chance to get into these movies because of all the byplay i love the beginnings of fifties horror movies they give us a pompous lecture on the defense systems near the arctic these were there to protect us from the expected soviet invasion but they should come in handy given the threat of very large insects this particular one flies for some reason despite its exoskeleton made of the stuff grasshoppers are made of they can still fend off air to air missiles and disable fighter planes anyway it s more fun first the obligatory deranged case who saw the flying thing cooling his heels in a hospital it just teaches one see an insect as big as a house keep your mouth shut i wonder if the poor guy got to go home after they found the bug otherwise this is a pretty ordinary effort it follows the usual efforts to come up with a way of dissuading the stubborn bug and leaves us open to other possibilities the russians next time i still get a kick out of these films and this one is serviceable,0
23726,by now the game s stale right the jokes have been done its all over the creative genius which drove this game for the first two games was gone after all wrong the game is still intact the jokes are here folks sure they re all rehash but so was monkey island 2 and 1 for that matter the difficulty is well placed somewhere between the slightly easy 1 and the ridiculously hard 2 the ship fighting sub game is badly innappropriate in the tradition of sub games and this game has the best joke of the whole series when asked for your membership card to an exclusive beach always select you don t need to see my identification its worth the price of the game by itself,1
1994,a pretty transparent attempt to wring cash out of the thriving british club scene sorted is a film that shows promise in certain departments but does very little else a perfunctory thriller plot which is there merely to string the club sequences together variable acting and a pretty ludicrous script all stop sorted from being the showcase that director jovy obviously intended however although jovy is sometimes over indulgent especially when using the often ill fitting dance music he does show potential and the lack of an anti drugs message is enormously refreshing overall however the film is a wasted opportunity and the prospects for a great clubbing movie remain out there somewhere watchable nevertheless,0
13222,i swear if i did ever tried cocaine i d be able to relate to this film perfectly its pace as well as the dialog churns out at speeds that some viewers might need to stop and relax their heads there are great little elements that pop up through out the film like how rob lowe s character seems to always be loosing a shoe or how some characters keep running spirals around his zigzagged path the story was put together extremely well and the direction seems flawless the movie reeks of clumsy and cuteness this is one i think most could enjoy a few laugh out loud even if you are alone moments ensure that i ll certainly be watching this again,1
7390,this movie is available as a special bonus feature on the double disc of horror 101 horror 102 endgame it has nothing to do with those movies except it does show that producers directors dudelson and clavell are in a rut like those other movies this one features young people who go to a building where they get trapped inside and run down the hallways a lot while they get picked off one by one in the end one or more characters are revealed to have another identity this is by far the worst of the three here people are invited to a halloween night only opening of the museum of the dead the museum doesn t have very many exhibits and they re all sort of ancient central american related there are also flesh eating infection spreading zombies in the museum as well as an ancient cannibal warrior and two female warriors the movie is very repetitious it kills people off fairly quickly to the point you wonder who they re going to have left to kill off at which point some more people show up without explanation so that they can be killed amazingly one of the characters does have a cellphone and is actually able to call the police who actually take it seriously and show up at the museum when one tries to pick the lock to get in the other tells him that would be forced entry if you ve got people trapped in a building who are injured i think that s irrelevant the cops are also stupid in that when they shoot a zombie in the head it goes down but then they shoot other zombies in the chest and they don t go down they happen to shoot another zombie in the head and it goes down they continue to shoot the rest of the zombies in the chest stupid the opening credits and a nightmare sequence are done in a sort of animation effect over video a poor man s waking life sort of thing but not so cartoonish it is sort of interesting however parts of some of the attacks are done the same way so there s no logic to it dreadful,0
17229,in this flame of emotion we are introduced to several different high school youngsters during one eventful day at school all of them struggle with belonging finding them selves and keeping their painful secrets from being revealed has the feel of a coming of age documentary focusing on students inner landscape and their way of dealing with everyday challenges gets of with a powerful opening and develops like a hymning requiem thalluri moves the camera with great skill and invites us slowly into the youngsters minds and hearts a fictional reconstruction that enlightens us all and reminds us of the frailty of youth one of the most important films of today every teenager should be given the opportunity to see this moving piece of film,1
9823,writer director patrice leconte takes a universal and potentially bottomless subject friendship and turns it into a flat and meaningless farce despite a list actors fine cinematography and elegant production design it s all in the plot and the plot is laughable teach me how to be likable art dealer fran ois coste daniel auteuil tells a random stranger dany boon and that about sums it up we learn next to nothing about friendship and daniel auteuil may be a fine actor but not one minute do we believe he could be the cut throat egoist the script depends on him to be just as we hope the travesty is over leconte pulls one of his usual cathartic third acts fast forwarding from damage to disaster like fran ois s treasured greek vase everyone and everything in this movie is a fake leconte s only asset is julie gayet in the part of coste s business partner catherine looking swell and sexy despite a major mishap of a haircut,0
5134,reading the book i felt once again drawn into castle rock needful things being the final part of the rock trilogy and the plot was a variant on the demon comes to small redneck village type story king likes to tell the characters were all described in loving detail and it made both a good psychological and gory horror the film on the other hand is awful gone are the character interactions and clever plot and replaced by a story that tries to be exciting but misses by a mile if you haven t read the book then you might enjoy this else avoid at all costs as with most films of king s books,0
11191,for many year i saw this movie as a real movie of ninjas but after study more about this culture i can only think this is just another karate film a black shinobi and some weapons doesn t make a ninja it s much more than that the ninja are the most dangerous warrior of the japan because they are trained in every aspect of life to survive to anything killing whatever try to stop them this movie is not a about a ninja warrior just about a clown trying to be something he cannot even understand,0
12556,i always loved this film the music story and the action i especially love the opening and closing of the film the music stayed with me throughout the years the wwi plane battles were great and the comedy is typical blake edwards slaptick is his forte after all julie s singing is amazing and keeps me glued to the screen the sets and the scenes are wonderful the characters are appealing i loved the scene with the wounded soldiers and julie s singing to them i wish she sang to me in vietnam i also enjoyed the old cars from the period and the wwi music i was glad when the dvd arrived now i can whistle in the dark watching it again and again,1
224,this film fails on every count for a start it is pretentious striving to be significant and failing miserably the script was banal in the extreme nobody at any time said anything remotely interesting it was impossible to care about any of the characters knightly was a self regarding waste of time whilst sienna miller was just a waste of time the bit about the soldier who went off to war was a clich even before the film atonement used it the use of the second world war as a backdrop was in itself a clich the bombs the sheltering in tube stations etc employed to import a bit of much needed drama why anybody thought for a moment that this film was worth making is quite beyond my comprehension it was yet another case of let s get the costumes looking authentic never mind about the story the script or the acting,0
7002,awful waste of time there is no camp or trash value in this one seen better amateur movies done by 10 to 12 years old kids in movie clubs how on earth someone can spoil movie about vampires and lesbians it s not a movie to put together a few vampire sadomasochism enthusiast in a same room and just shoot it could not find anything good about the film there was no plot no real actors no real special effects no humor a few overweight goths touching each other cannot be called a sex scene nothing at all well cemetery was nice but one should shot a vampire movie during dark purpose was probably good make a trash movie in a spirit of ed wood problem is that one cannot make a bad movie intentionally it takes talent and an effort to make a real movie ed wood might have lacked money but he sure had effort these guys lacked everything ed wood was a genius compared to these guys,0
9765,essentially a undistinguished b movie that mysteriously is directed by one of the golden era s major talents fritz lang even with the stellar names of lang walter pidgeon joan bennett and george sanders be prepared for a ludicrous storyline bad acting patently phony sets and miscasting for transparency sake i have to admit i am an ardent non admirer of walter pidgeon who was lucky to have found a niche at the artificial dream factory of mgm and somehow worked in secondary roles supporting greer garson and others he is wildly miscast acting in a chipper 30s ray milland madcap comedy tone in a role where his life is in danger and he is in hiding joan bennett s cockney accent is excessive but her lacquered hair perfect makeup and classy outfit belies a street wise cockney slum girl george sanders is incapable of bad acting but disappears after the preposterous opening finds pidgeon somehow pretending to shoot adolph hitler surprising for fritz lang is the unevenness of tone i found the film wavered uneasily between occasional moments of suspense thriller surrounded by light hearted comedic interplay hitchcock totally reversed the ratio using comic relief to occasionally pace the suspense there is a reason this film is unknown it didn t serve or propel anybody s career or reputation and is forgotten because it s a surprisingly bad film from such a pedigreed group,0
17164,surprisingly enjoyable movie a group of thieves lead by mark wahlberg rob a gold safe in italy and thankfully for them the heist is successful and they get away with it without any big problems before the group can celebrate however steve played by ed norton decides he want the gold all for himself and pulls a cout de ta on the group and shoots one of the members he and his accomplices leave thinking that the group is dead but luckily the group is not dead a year later we get back into the story where the group has tracked down norton and decide to steal the gold back and spend the rest of the movie coming up with plans to steal back their gold and settle a score this was a surprise for me it had all the makings to be a typical forgettable summer movie but it was actually memorable and really fun to watch what i like is how smart and well thought out the plans in the movie are and how the movie feels realistic watching the trailer would make you think it was some mindless action movie but in fact there are only two action scenes in the movie and they are all really well done the latter action scene is a very long 20 min scene that has one of the best car chases ever done i like how real the chase is and how everything is done old school style without the aid of cgi me personally i enjoyed this car chase more than the cgi filled chase in matrix 2 i remember watching music videos by director f gary gray and always noticed how well made they were and thought he d make a great filmmaker turns out i was right as always and he proves it here can t wait to see what he does with the sequel the actors do a decent job too with seth green being my favorite of the group the other thing i loved was the excellent score by john powell ever since i heard his score for robots this year i ve been a fan of him and paying close attention to his music and the man is really good he does a great job of avoiding all the typical summer action movie musical clich s and provides a very well done score i haven t seen the original that this is based on so i can t really say how well it stacks up to that one so yeah this is a great popcorn movie that actually has a brain unlike most of the summer movie crap that comes out has great characters is funny as hell and has a amazing score by john powell if you love heist movies then you ll love this one you know if i was in the group they d call me handsome mike,1
16848,this movie exemplifies a certain brand of comedy horror of a strictly adult kind but quite different to the troma movies with which it shares certain qualities the humour is rough and ready but fast and furious if the idea of hideous dolls with evil powers and twisted minds don t make you shrug with boredom reach for the six pack of beer and enjoy the best chucky film yet,1
24152,the first half hour of homegrown was rather boring and not absorbing but as the film progressed so did my interest in the characters and the plot several scenes are really scary and you fear for the main characters who you actually grow attached to the story is about three hired hands on a hidden illegal marijuana farm in southern california they witness the murder of the farm s owner malcolm john lithgow and they take over the weed for their own the three rather simple minded farm hands soon get swept up into a scary world of mafia and local interest while all of the time trying to convince everyone that malcolm is still alive while the movie had several faults and a slow beginning it turned out to be worthwhile 7 10 stars,1
24568,i don t know if it s fair for me to review this i m not a fan of gratuitous violence i ve never understood the movie industry making heroes out of mob members and cold blooded killers when the godfather came out i thought they had broken the mold but the decades have produced a series of well acted mob movies with major stars and directors doing them this one is obviously low budget but it is certainly well done at some point in all of these i feel like i want to take a shower if such characters actually exist it is hard for the soul i always intellectualize that humankind will rise above this sort of thing this kind of crud has to be stopped i hope the people that go to films like this are more voyeuristic and less vicarious i feel sort of the same way about slasher movies why do we have a fascination with death and dismemberment in fairness i am judging this on the acting and directing and for what it is it seems to work pretty well,1
5892,i managed to avoid reading hemingway in college from what i could tell along with his reductivist verbiage he offered reductivist story lines this film transfiguration of af2a into a simplistic hoary belabored narrative does not disabuse me of my suspicions a guy who barely sees action on the european battlefield hudson falls in with a nurse jones and they conspire to spend time together hemingway s big contribution to narrative was the romantic travelogue who knows what these two lovers have in common they re so utterly generic the movie never even brings up the utter irresponsibility it takes to abandon the front in favor of a lovers adventure the two have a season on the alps straight out of a j crew catalog a number of better scenes are undermined by corny conventional melodrama elsewhere the movie keeps piling on tiny improbable unspecific details that fight the epic treatment the cavernous hospital that miss barkley works in is virtually empty so that no secondary plot line can possibly distract from the flimsy main story complicated it is not the camera work is better than average with some amazing location photography director charles vidor or maybe huston does striking things in the first hour with an on location wide screen camera there are no second unit cop outs vidor shows massive panoramic tableaux pans over a line of hundreds of soldiers trooping through the mountains and then with a 90 degree swivel of his camera catches up with hudson s ambulance barreling down on him hudson looks great he s a better actor than he gets credit for but with unshaped material like this he can become very mechanical mercedes mccambridge plays a one dimensional shrew jennifer jones is puffy and miscast in the lackluster female lead the movie is best when she s off screen the love scenes are about as affecting as a coffee commercial,0
11367,over all it was a real good movie though all the actors besides jones sucked by the time i was half was through it i was really getting tired of seeing al only change i would have made to it would to have more flash backs possibly with the real cobb,0
24325,this indie film is worth a look because of the enormous talent of its creators wallace wolodarsky and marsha forbes mr wolodarsky has directed the young cast and he is to be praised for this effort the premise of the film is a cautionary tale of the danger for wanting something one can t have which is the story of alice and ed after living together for a while alice suddenly gets restless because she imagines she s lacking experience in the sex area alice and ed s relationship while not an example of ideal happiness is a comfortable way to share their lives with one another that is until the moment alice and claire her sister happened to bump into a sexual encounter by another couple that has no clue of being observed this incident makes alice reevaluate her own sexual life with ed she finds it lacks substance when she proposes seeing other people ed is shocked to put it mildly but not wanting to contradict alice he decides to go along what happens next is that both alice and ed enter into a world that s been unknown to them the people they meet in the end are not worth the trouble they sadly realize at the end they were made for each other the film is worth watching in order to see the amazing julianne nicholson who we happen to have liked in another indie film tully ms nicholson reminds us of a young shirley mclaine she projects such a luminous quality about her that is hard to take one s eyes from her whenever she is in a scene this young actress proves she is an accomplished performer who gets better with each new appearance basically she carries the movie her alice is a study in contrasts alice is a decent woman who thinks she is inadequate in pleasing ed because of her inexperience jay mohr is an excellent match for ms nicholson both do wonders together his ed is perfectly credible we have known people like him deep down inside he is a good person who suddenly gets himself in a situation he didn t call for yet he goes along only to discover he is too decent and not cut out for a life of gratuitous sex with the willing women that have no problem with a tumble in the hay just for fun the rest of the cast is wonderful lauren graham does some amazing work as claire alice s yuppie sister andy ritcher is also wonderful as the grounded carl the nerdy friend who finally finds out fulfillment when he meets penelope a single mother as penelope helen slater makes a felicitous albeit of a short appearance in the film the director is enormously gifted who will no doubt go places because he shows he is well suited for the job,1
6420,this allegedly based on a true story tv movie concerns a woman on the run from the fbi and a seriously stupid guy first we have roger paulson tim matheson a regular guy type with a mind numbing job an ex wife a kid he hardly ever gets to see and some cats next there is elaine lisa you name it tracy pollan a smart sexy good looking woman whose tongue would burst into flame if she ever told the truth roger and lisa meet when she answers a lonely hearts ad roger is one of these poor saps who can t seem to handle living alone so after his wife dumped him he places his ad it doesn t take long for roger to figure out that lisa is not a good person but he has no idea how to get rid of her he doesn t even have enough sense to change the locks on his apartment door after he throws her out go ahead and watch this if you don t have anything else to do,0
255,the opening of the jungle promises us a safari adventure with a science fiction element but mostly what we get is a travelogue with lots of stock footage and padding and the odd leopard attack the movie is leisurely when you want it to be gripping and tries to inject interest into the proceedings with badly staged matches between various wild animals i had no idea that lions and wild boars were natural enemies in the wild did you i thought the big cats stuck to hunting herbivores but apparently the producers knew better as for the actors cesar does his usual great job of rocking the mustache and marie windsor is reasonably believable as the progressively thinking rajah s daughter nice eyebrows btw however rod cameron is barely watchable as the hunter returning as the sole survivor of his expedition i m sure he was in demand in his day but here he comes off as a rent a center bogart rough looking but with none of bogey s range or timing he spends the movie going back and forth from stoic anger to angry stoicism and any time the screenplay attempts to crank up some romantic sparks between himself and windsor you just have to laugh that crabbed knobby face isn t a good vehicle for tenderness the screenplay is not entirely without merit although it does make some odd choices early in the first act the screenplay makes a point of spending several moments where the heroes decide to bring along the obligatory clever young boy and monkey mascot but then basically ignore them until spoiler the monkey somehow gets hold of a live hand grenade during the mammoth scene and accidentally tosses near windsor this is so cameron can prove his bravery by diving on it and saving her life at the cost of his own end spoiler it s possible that the indian version of this movie which i understand ran better than 2 1 2 hours might have given the kid and the monkey more to do another thing that makes the film show its age spoiler is the issue of the woolly mammoths the plot device that sets the safari into motion in the first place when they finally appear the way the scene is filmed it s obvious that the mammoths obviously elephants draped in shag carpeting aren t really attacking anyone or even moving all that fast and yet cameron immediately sets to trying to wipe them out with hand grenades these days the idea of destroying the last known specimens of a species thought to be extinct would be unthinkable especially when all they seem to do is roll through the jungle at a nice walking pace end of spoiler so imo four stars which is pretty good for a robert lippert production normally lippert hack jobs rate two or three stars at best it s not a train wreck of a film or anything plus it seems to mean well with the rajah s daughter arguing for amelioration of the most repressive aspect of the traditional ways and the elements of mixed race romance that was pretty progressive in 1952 and there s some nice scenery and exotic spectacle see it if someone offers to show it to you for free but don t expect much except an interesting historical chapter of early fantasy cinema,0
5989,by dane youssefi was kind of looking forward to this one i enjoy eddie murphy and i love it when a star hand makes a vehicle for themselves or when someone who writes decides to mark their own directorial debut but when the star s head gets too big for the rest of his body there s always a danger of a big budgeted hollywood vanity production will the filmmaker keep it real or will he just waste amounts of money the studio s ours and time the studio s ours his own patting himself on the back for an hour in a half sadly it s the latter here another thing i really like is when someone breathes new and fresh life into an exhausted and dried out genre none of that here the warring nightclub movies have become so worn through that even the parodies of it are dreary and done to death murphy does neither he does the most clich d he plugs into a routine conventional formula gangster picture and plays it as seriously as if it were the godfather it s like a script where the next draft they put in the jokes and the new ideas but it seems like someone with clout just looked at it and went no this is fine probably murphy he is credited all over this in the opening shot of beautiful white satin sheets his name headlines across the credits about five times the plot a young orphan saves pryor s life and pryor adopts the little ragamuffin 20 years later pryor s dump has become a first class hot spot they re pulling down big money and a gangster wants their action he s even got a dirty cop in his employ but pryor comes up with a scheme a la the sting murphy s screenplay plays like an unfinished first draft that nobody had the pair to call him on the actors aren t really allowed to stand out much if at all even the almighty murphy seems to be on auto pilot pryor shows class and gentlemanly manners as sugar ray perhaps it would have been better to name his character brown sugar ray further evidence that this one needed a polish but everyone here is basically just on vacation the oscar nomination the movie received is richly deserved joe i tompkins best costume design but the production values are the only part that makes the 30 s feel authentic some sets look somewhat fake but this is supposed to be a comedy of sorts it s rare one movie gets nominated for both a razzie and an oscar unless it s one of lucas new star wars chapters it s 1938 and everyone is talking like it s 1988 particularly the comedians this is a prehistoric white man s formula and with all these black comedians and satirists you expect them to skewer the genre or at least bring new life to it nope murphy is pretty much just coasting here the great roger ebert summed it up perfectly when he remarked in his review murphy approaches his story more as a costume party in which everybody gets to look great while fumbling through a plot that has not been fresh since at least 1938 jasmine guy is perfectly cast and seems to be indulging herself in her role and michael lerner has all the looks evil and mannerisms of the prototypical mob boss down pat and there are moments where pryor gives you an idea of what a more interesting leader and authority figure would sound like he gives every scene he s in a feeling of dignity would it have been too much to ask that della resse sing or at least quit embarrassing herself with all her kiss my ass talk and the late redd foxx doesn t get to leave much of a swan song here he has some back and forth with resse which could have been some great stuff nope murphy wastes another opportunity again here murphy s quick is charismatic and likable but those moments are few and far between for sure murphy has never looked better and never been duller his character made me laugh twice throughout the whole movie stan shaw s boxer with a horrible speech impediment isn t just painful and embarrassing it s annoying there s more to comedy than simply showing something unpleasant you have to incorporate some kind of light touch and funny situation watching him strain even the some of the easiest words just makes us feel sorry for him and annoyed with murphy can murphy write a screenplay well there was raw but that was really stand up material he wrote the outline for boomerang and coming to america for sure but her didn t have the last word there maybe a team of er like script doctors could ve revived this one murphy s direction is so slow and quiet you d swear he was asleep at the wheel some of the time he has too many static shots and doesn t seem to know how to build and release suspense on some level i think quick is the real eddie murphy angry young hot headed and ambitious but occasionally charming now if he were only funny sometime there s a scene in which murphy has a femme fa tale in bed who plans to make love with him and kill him you can probably guess how it turns out like everything else in the movie this could have been better but surprisingly murphy has not directed another movie since he got a razzie nomination and he no longer writes the finished draft for his films either he won the razzie for writing this it s great to look at and the music is beautiful and there are a few really nice scenes but that just falls under the category of gems among all the junk not enough of them couldv e been shouldv e been wasn t oh well by dane youssef,0
5161,i kind of liked the film it s just that the characters run around with no real point to their craziness as i was saying poor goat the goat was nahing while the guy was pretending to grind on it i would have liked the rape scenes to be more graphic not the one with the goat though jane ryall who played celia only did this one film she was very nude throughout this crazy couple who killed and tortured many people ended up in their rightful places i almost forgot about the gay transvestite couple who are also picked out for being sinners if you like crazy off the wall stuff then this is your film 3 10,0
5320,this movie was an embarrassment ulma thurman looked like she had some kind of disease and john travolta looked like he was walking in his sleep i was expecting this to be a so so sequel to get shorty not a half baked remake of the exact same movie except that some of the character s have different names and clothes i would not recommend this to movie to my worst enemy i feel like i was ripped off and hollywood has once again tricked me into seeing another horrible sequel i also suffered through alien vs predator the best thing that i can say about this movie is that it has my vote for the worst movie of 2005,0
3099,in efforts to make a somewhat comedic yet serious movie about the art of growing marijuana stephen gyllenhaal director fell a few bong rips short of a good movie while the cast is nothing short of amazing this movie is extremely hard to sit through the acting of billy bob thornton ryan phillipe jon bon jovi hank azaria and kelly lynch couldn t even save this movie from failure it would be wiser to flush three single dollar bills down the toilet then to check this movie out at the local video store,0

3228,i watched the first episode of the war at home because i thought it was worth replacing arrested development boy was i disappointed it should be clear to everyone that this show was blatantly ripped off of grounded for life titus and married with children since they are all similar in plot and overall mood the so called punch lines are all repetitious and formulaic even more those punch lines aren t even funny at all to me they re more along the lines as being crass and crude the main character dave gold acts like a white trash thug who thinks he s being funny and cool which he s not even hillary dave s daughter said so in the episode gaza strip in the episode dream crusher hillary wanted to be a singer but was actually pretty bad dave and vicky then gladly decided to crush her dreams by telling her she sucked after that she then wanted to be a child psychologist and planned on going to harvard after telling dave and vicky so and left the room the two of them began mindlessly mocking her also in the first episode dave said of hillary s black boyfriend does she actually think we re gonna let her go out with this guy i d rather drink my own urine that line has to the dumbest line in the history of television and dave is constantly making fun of larry his son when he breaks the fourth wall because he thinks he s gay and is a geek also let s not forget that he also made fun of larry s fat girlfriend dave is the father he s supposed to stand up for his son no matter what the war at home is without a doubt the worst tv show for family that clearly explains why the show should be canceled since it spreads a racism and homophobic agenda it s like the show wants to be funny for always putting in that stupid laugh track every time someone says something but the lines are all somewhat forced idiotic and pathetically juvenile another reason why the show s horrible is the acting mike rappaport and kyle sullivan are terrible terrible actors rappaport has to always move his hands around when he s in front of the camera he not only does this on this show but he also did that during his time with boston public sullivan talks and acts like some kind of robot every time he acts he also did this in malcolm in the middle so to wrap this whole thing up you all got your reasons of what s wrong with this show 1 it s unoriginal 2 the acting sucks 3 it s not even funny 4 all the jokes are the same 5 has lousy script 6 the characters are pitiful and unlikable 7 the dad s a rip off of archie bunkerfox needs to take this trash off the air because anything s better than this,0
11649,what is it about drug addiction that so draws first time filmmakers to offer their own take on the subject this subject has been done to death drug abuse is bad we get it drug addiction is painful to watch we get that too but the bleak subject matter doesn t give the filmmaker license to make a sloppy film every film need not be hitchcockian masterpiece of cinematic excellence or use orson wellesian deep focus but it s still a narrative movie verite does not mean pseudo documentary even consumer mini dv cameras are capable of producing white whites and black blacks and this filmmaker is just being lazy by shooting no contrast scenes with existing lighting the subject is bleak enough without artificially forcing it with sloppy cinematography and even documentary films have a sound mix vera farmiga is very talented given the right material but the director obviously over directed her and sucked all the life out of her performance addicts may live in a fog but they still have emotions but none of these characters seem to exist off screen the supporting players merely delivered their lines without creating real people sorry to be so harsh debra but some things are true whether want to believe them or not i m sure your next film will be better but please not another drug movie,0
11475,i can t figure out what jon voight could possibly have been thinking when he got involved in this tenth rate incoherent pretentious mind numbing slop he helped to write the alleged script himself and he should be damn well ashamed of it the film i can t call it a movie because it barely moves at all is rambling embarrassingly pretentious drivel sort of like a really bad oprah winfrey show but worse it meanders senselessly back and forth from medieval times to modern day los angeles with voight as a television producer who thinks he is the reincarnation of a medieval prince who must save the kingdom from the machinations of his evil brother and somehow this gets transferred to modern times where voight has to save the country from the evil machinations of an oil company executive if the bizarre casting wilfrid brimley frankie valli kaye ballard and armand assante among others isn t enough to kill it the stupefyingly inept direction the washed out photography it looks like it was shot with a really cheap 16mm camera the almost complete lack of editing scenes either go on and on endlessly or are chopped off in the middle of a sentence and voight s embarrassing apparently stream of consciousness acting are enough to bury it which is exactly what should have been done with it a jaw dropping experience avoid this dog at all costs,0
22146,family guy has been hilarious for so long but i feel like it lost it s sharp and random humor at the start of season 6 although i enjoyed blue harvest it felt like the remaining episodes were wrapping up episodes where the producers made little attempt to fulfill family guy s reputation of american social satire i have seen all the episodes from season 7 and i was utterly surprised and happy that family guy has found their true colors again season 7 delivers a lot of fantastic episodes and with a lot of jokes about the current situations in america which is exactly what we need right now more fun i feel that the simpsons has lost its spark all together this show however has made a terrific recovery from going down to proving how perfectly satirical they can be great job,1
17302,when you look at mexico s best movies you will more than likely find that the photography was performed by gabriel figueroa he is recognized in the world as one of the best that have ever existed his master control of the cameras gave an added asset to the movies he was part of if added to his participation we add the direction of luis bunuel you will never find such a pair of aces anywhere else in the world this story nazarin was written by spain s greatest writer besides miguel de cervantes don quijote de la mancha the story in itself is superb nazarin a priest that lives by his beliefs tries to live a very christian life but as always there are people that do not accept this he wanders through many places preaching his christianity but finding most of the time people that do not accept him but besides the splendid story it is always interesting to try to interpret the enigmatic messages that bunuel sends us throughout the picture in scenes that make you shiver,1
13519,gen y cops since i heard of the film being in release i have been wanting to see it because i loved gen x cops i was a little disappointed that a nicholas tse didn t return and b too much slapstick nevertheless i enjoyed the sequel because it may not be good as the first film but it is good in its own way stephen fung returns as the ultracool ladies man match who has a steady girl in oli note where is haze and sam lee returns as the insane alien this time sporting a mohawk and speaking a lot of english the real star of the film is newcomer edison chen he makes a great replacement for nicholas tse as edison i also enjoyed paul rudd s performance of agent curtis he seems to be the tough as nails smartmouth fbi agent you d love to hate but soon you d like his character the fight scenes are a lot better in this one even though there are very few but they are great courtesy of jackie chan stuntman nicky li look for a cameo from ron smoorenburg as a cage fighter who has a teeny little fight with match smoorenburg also is the stunt double for rudd if you liked gen x cops you ll love gen y cops,1
4859,this movie made me watch paul w s anderson s avp1 and enjoy it i am not even going to dream of comparing requiem to any of the alien or predator series movies this is a horrible teenage b horror footage set in an american small town no one cares about avp1 at least had heaps of handcrafted art carved into the movie sets it had bags of eye candy not previously seen in any of the original movies but was ruined by unconvincing characters acting requiem takes bad acting to the lowest imaginable level and it also lacks in every other department just as much it s a sacrilege to include alien and predator suits in this kind of rubbish,0
6288,i know terry gilliam is considered as a good director but claiming that this movie is good is just foolish what was the movie about what is it a spoof fantasy comedy satire no answer there from gilliam s screenplay totally confused and pointlessly hurtling from one historical age to another i find it amusing that some people actually call this movie magical is it because they have to praise any movie which is vague and indecisive on what it is about 3 stars for special effects considering it is 1981 roger ebert has it right in his review the movie is ambiguous and looks like gilliam s romp with money just to make a vague children s move masquerading as a historical revue the movie also tries to confuse the would be viewer by giving john cleese and sean connery top billing,0
8110,two years after this short the last our gang short was made after seeing this you wonder how it even lasted that much longer the quality of our gang nosedived soon after moving from hal roach to mgm and this short is a perfect example the gags are all very unfunny and froggy s last line of this being the happiest day of his life paints a bad picture in your mind of what it s like for him the rest of the time a very poor example of film making,0
7783,this film plays like a demented episode of vh1 s where are they now or behind the music in the first half of the movie that depict his glory days abbie hoffman is unintentionally portrayed as a sort of delusional rock star you know the kind the poseur lead singer the pretty boy who didn t write any of the music doesn t have a clue but gets all the glory for nothing and chicks for free consequently he takes his success for granted abuses it and ultimately destroys it along with himself indeed hoffman s glory days ended abruptly when he was busted for dealing cocaine skipped bail and went into hiding the second part of the movie deals with that time in hiding in it we see hoffman as a pathetic crybaby endlessly blaming everyone anyone but himself for his downfall eventually the times pass him by completely and he can never to come to grips with that how sad the end end credits roll and oh no we learn that abbie hoffman eventually committed suicide in 1989 i m sure this is not the image the filmmakers intended for hoffman in making this movie given that tom hayden and gerald lefcourt were involved i m sure they intended this film as some kind of homage to the life of a man who was after all an icon of the 60 s and of the left s anti war movement in this they have failed miserably the film presents abbie hoffman as a mindless caricature we are never told about what drives him how did he arrive at his views how did he manage to capture the imagination of a whole generation how did he organize such a vast movement why at the height of his fame did he get involved in dealing cocaine why who knows and since the filmmakers don t seem to ultimately who cares,0
4021,words cannot express how poor this film is there is no plot the acting is appalling basically the whole film is a joke with a running time of 97 minutes it s about 96 minutes too long it might have been ok as a short sketch on a comedy show but the premise is way too flimsy to work for that amount of time without boredom kicking in avoid this one go rent a good movie instead,0
6132,in fact parts of it i liked a lot it had some interesting twists but it just left me with a been there seen that feeling after all of the saw movies granted the ending was different from a typical saw but let s face it a group of guys unknown to each other or so they believe tossed together in an abandoned chemical factory but then it loses something there s no intensity there s poor group dynamic there s no sense of urgency some nice twists at the end and definitely worth a watch if there s nothing else on your plate but it just left me empty it passed the time but it didn t satisfy,0
7392,a study in bad bad direction bad acting bad writing and f x that ll teach you that you d better upgrade your computer before filming it s the kind of flick you used to do totally drunk in your cellar with dad s camera when you were young at heart but you certainly would not show it in public when you re sober again would you you wouldn t even view it avoid at all costs,0
23503,what can be said about one of the greatest n64 games ever that the action is fast enough to keep even a seasoned fps veteran sweating bullets quite literally that the graphics are great down to the explosions that everyone loves to see that nothing is quite as fun as playing multiplayer mode and shooting your friends and siblings in the back with submachine guns very little beats goldeneye 007 about the only thing missing was voice acting and a bit more intelligence in the enemy soldiers if you have an n64 and you like shooting people and things crossed with espionage get a copy of this,1
23983,if you want to see a film starring stan laurel from the laurel hardy comedies this is not the film for you stan would not begin to find the character and rhythms of those films for another two years if however you want a good travesty of the rudolph valentino blood and sand which had been made the previous year this is the movie for you all the stops are pulled out both in physical comedy and on the title cards and if the movie is not held together by character the plot of valentino s movie is used well sort of,1
17917,alright so maybe the impersonations of jay leno and david letterman are not spot on but you still get a sense of who these people are and how they operate behind the screen bob balaban and treat williams are excellant as warren littlefield and micheal ovitz the movie doesn t go for joke and punchline but it is still funny kathy bates in particular is amazing as leno s manager funny amazing interesting very watchable this is a good tv movie,1
6313,spoilers sorry the first word that sprung to mind whilst watching the film is gremlins it s the only critters movie i have seen from the four movies but i enjoyed it it wasn t too complicated as i hadn t seen the past two but i thought it was quite a good movie all the same critters starts with a man his son and daughter stopping off on the way to a vacation although it turns out that they end up at their own home which i have no idea what the hell went on the girl meets up with a boy played by leo dicaprio and they go hang out in a nearby forest they meet this weird guy who tells them to be careful and stuff because of the critters he seems a bit psychotic and if i was in that situation i would not speak to him the critters steal a ride of the girl and boy s car and end up in their flat thing they hide out in the basement and end up killing this lazy jerk they then nearly kill this fat woman and the girl s dad they are chased higher and higher up the flat until they hide in the attic the critters eat stuff in the kitchen spoof of the gremlins kitchen scene and i can t remember not a good thing but i m sure they have to go back for something someone anyway they end up getting out and saved the psychotic guy comes back and before he kills the last two critters he is told he can t because they are endangered and so he sends them home the ending was disappointing and i was annoyed that only the lazy guy died as there were quite a few annoying characters i would personally have killed off it s a thrilling exciting movie worth a watch but if you re looking for a better version of this genre i recommend the gremlins movies sorry,0
20908,when the episode was made and aired eisenhower was president kennedy was president elect as for the episode it was a passable episode if not a bit earnest the professor shows not much range here and the whole thing seems a little rushed a lot of episodes of the tz seem to not fit the time slot some seeming like they re crammed in and rushed some with little or nothing to it spread out over the half hour and some of course fit i guess you just expect a little more tension than to be taken back to some rooms and drugged but overall a decent episode indeed the what if motif of time travel is a nugget in itself and sets the table of with basic interest 7 out of 10 considering there were a lot of tz episodes not quite as good and some a great deal better,1
5750,the only riddle in this film was how it ever got made the british film industry needs to make films people actually want to watch and not look to get taxpayers money a la bbc to keep luvvies in their life style they have been accustomed to with doing nothing for it the film was every thing wrong with british films it relied on stereotypes it had to be about a london were people were either posh and corrupt gangsters luvvies or gawd blimey jellied eel types the story script was just pathetically weak to the extent when the police man pulled out his phone and the ring tone was the sweeney theme i just expected it the whole film was a happy shopper sweeney minder rip off the priceless manuscript i noted got left behind and lost on a few occasions and is something even i with my limited street wiseness wouldn t carry around in my breast pocket every where to the beach and fights etc saying that vinnie jones is likable which is about the only thing in the film poor bloke when derek jacobi walked into the water at the end because he was dickens oh my god what a load of crap and i am being positive here,0
7577,may contain spoilers this movie is the epitome of weirdness i rented it hoping for a film so bad it would be funny however i still honestly can t decide if this film was intended to be scary or humorous it combines the emotions in a rather disturbing way apparently this is trying to be clever but in actual fact it isn t for instance when the knife comes out and tries to kill the teacher it starts playing happy music when we go to toxico we have up beat quasi mr roger s neighborhood music however when the little kid s dreaming of falling in blood and when he finds the leg these are clearly intended to be tense so watch this film and decide for yourself it is too weird to be described in words and for that i say kudos nose dive wow,0
13899,the debut that plucked from obscurity one of the brighter stars of contemporary noir is an assured if limited stab at the con game and obsession filmed for zero money nolan couldn t have chosen a better subject than the drab and seamy underside of london to ply his trade given the lack of funds this short 67 min is at its best in playing with the audience s and protagonist s expectations about who is scamming whom though the initial set up does ring some alarm bells in the credibility dept the muddy cinematography he often used natural lighting due to budget can be mostly chalked up to noir stylization though the limitations do show at times one can easily see nolan s style developing in this fledgling effort many of the same themes of blurred identity and expectation smashing recur in memento and insomnia not a masterpiece but good and certainly worth a look for modern noir and nolan fans,1
512,i am a big fan of sci fi movies so when i saw this movie in the epg i thought i was in for a pleasant evening what a disappointment such a poor display of special effects i could not imagine in 1980 but in 2005 come on why would you do special effects of an helicopter flying in the desert when you can film a real one for a much lower price i guess and those killer muppets well i could do better than that in a couple of hours in the garage you can expect to have a low budget on a movie but i don t think it s reasonable to have a low movie for any budget as for the star of the movie i use a lot of quotes tonight lou diamond philips the guy is not even remotely an actor maybe he should have stayed to the martial arts movies all in all an awful movie maybe i am in a bad mood tonight then again maybe not a sincere 1 out of 10,0
55,oh my bad clothing worse synth music and the worst david hasselhoff the 80 s are back with vengeance in witchery an american italian co production helmed by infamous joe d amato on the production side and short careered director thank heavens for small miracles fabrizio laurenti directing marketed as a kind of sequel to sam raimi s evil dead series in italy that was dubbed la casa in there witchery delivers some modest gore groceries and bad acting a mix of ghost story possessions and witchcraft the film bounces clueless from scene to another without letting some seriously wooden actors and hilarious day and night mix ups slow it s progress to expectable ending topped with some serious wtf surprise climax i just love the look on her face surprisingly laurenti manages to gather some suspense and air of malice in few very few scenes unluckily for him these few glimpses of mild movie magic go down quickly and effectively the plus sides are experienced when the gore hits the fan this department is quite effective and entertaining in that classic latex and red paint style of the 80 s italo gore when things were made 100 hand made and as shockingly and vivid as modest budgets could allow i could only watch with sadistic glee and few laughters all the over the top ways that obnoxious characters and actors got mangled and misused one by one i only felt sorry for linda blair who apparently haven t been let to try any other than that good old possessed girl woman role ever in his career or so it looks like when checking out his filmography well folks not much more to tell and even less to tell home about don t expect too much when spending some rainy afternoon with this and probably you ll experience at least some mild fun it also helps if your rotten little heart pounds in the beat of 80 s euro gore horror and speaking of hearts every movie that has david hasselhoff getting skewered by a sizeable metal object and bleeding heavily around the room and corridors must have it s one on the right place this is my truth what is yours,0
19606,this film marked the end of the serious universal monsters era abbott and costello meet up with the monsters later in abbott and costello meet frankentstein it was a somewhat desparate yet fun attempt to revive the classic monsters of the wolf man frankenstein s monster and dracula one last time i say desparate because in the previous film house of frankenstein both dracula and the wolf man are killed according to how the vampire and werewolf legends say they should be dracula by the sunlight and the wolf man by a silver bullet yet somehow they return in house of dracula with no explanation this movie could have played as a kind of prequel to house of frankenstein if the frankenstein monster plot wouldn t be continuing chronologically into house of dracula from house of frankenstein and if the wolf man didn t get cured then there d be no plot holes but since this is not the case the plots of dracula and the wolf man make no sense however ignoring these plot holes house of dracula is a classic atmospheric horror film that s fun to watch it has many high points especially seeing the wolf man get cured i know i just said that this shouldn t have been included but it was nice to actually see him get cured after all this time and the scene with the lady playing moonlight senada on the piano then all of a sudden playing a haunting melody when under dracula s spell was very eerie dr edleman s transformation into the dr jekyl mr hyde type character was also done very well and it s great to see dracula frankenstein and the wolf man together one last time out of,1
537,hey i really do not know why this film has been appreciated so much perhaps i missed the point the way i see it a lot of international film makers have made brilliant films that have dealt with schizophrenia and have informed excited shocked evoked emotion and compelled the audience to step aside from their own reality and think while it is true that aparna sen s endeavor was an ambitious one in light of all the other movies this one falls short miserably it was too slow there were no details about anything and the ending was completely pointless it was not open ended or anything just pointless so watch it if you want to see a good concept completely wasted,0
14115,i first heard about commander s log when i was on the concom for the local science fiction convention craig bowlsby linden banks sophie banks and brian oberquell came out to show the video and give a couple of panels on making tv on a shoestring budget i have to say that i was very pleased when i finally had the chance to see the show comparisons with red dwarf are inevitable since the first seasons of red dwarf were also shot on a low budget although commander s log has to set some kind of record for the least amount of money spent per minute of air time and thus have to make up for the lack of eye candy with good writing and acting linden banks who plays chief petty officer blather does a particularly good job of presenting an earnest but clueless persona bowlsby s original idea was for the story to be told in two minute interstitials shown in between other shows over the course of an evening although for some reason space didn t get how cool an idea this would have been and so the interstitials were all rolled up into a one hour show which space normally showed in two half hour episodes the existing dvd doesn t include episode 3 which premiered at cascadia con in seattle in 2005 or episode 4 which was previewed at vcon in vancouver in 2006 but if you re in touch with your local fannish community you may catch news of a showing somewhere near you,1
10716,the pace of this movie is quite slow it takes about 70 minutes to get katie to china which we know that she will and leaves 30 minutes to wrap things up the storyline is so predictable that you know everything after about 5 minutes nothing surprises you i guess that the movie is a coming of age movie but the movie is full of stereotypes that are quite over the top katie a beauty that realizes that looks boys and shopping isn t everything she realizes that she can feel and see the real world touching the mother high strung nervous screaming mother wow very innovative that need taking care of by a strong man the father patient and always understanding and takes care of the incapable woman the boyfriend that only wants to get into her pants the comedian clown chinese guy that doesn t know how to speak english properly and made a laughing stock thought hollywood dropped those characters in the mid fifties the nurse that at times knows everything how to get around in china that in the next moment is a carbon copy of the mother i e a woman who cant handle the situation or knows anything the deformed chinese girl that with the help of us westerns get help and become a beautiful girl because in china a third world country according to the film don t have anything and hence needs our charity gah wake up and smell what you are shoveling sure that there are some poverty in china but the portrayal of the aid from western countries read usa is so shallow and happy ending ish that it is sad and revolting shanghai where the movie is set is the most expanding and evolving city in the world at the moment the chinese father that is so nice and goodhearted that in the end has one wish to be a cowboy with a white hat the teacher sean astin that has this really heart ripping story not that he tells without feel why sean why etc etc it is difficult to actually finding a real person in the entire movie this is nothing but a feel good movie for americans below age 15 if you want to learn anything about the world watch e g hotel rwanda instead for a better life story or coming of age movie i suggest you watch the italian cinema paradiso that won the best foreign film academy reward some years back the only nice thing in the movie were the small town sceneries that truly capture some not all of the beautiful chinese country side i have been there and seen some of it,0
4070,i had always eyed italian horror maestro dario argento s efforts as producer with a certain suspicion and these were only confirmed after my fairly recent viewing of lamberto bava s terrible demons 1985 the fact that this was supposed to be its third installment did not sound promising at all but i decided to give the film a rental regardless now that we re in full halloween swing i checked out the theatrical trailer on the anchor bay dvd prior to viewing the main feature the undeniably striking visuals had me intrigued to be sure but then the film proper which makes no more sense than what s presented in that frenzied two minute montage and in retrospect can be seen to have wisely compiled most of its highlights proved a definite let down opening promisingly enough with a medieval prologue straight out of alexander nevsky 1938 it goes downhill fast because it relies too much on surreal imagery at the expense of narrative consequently several characters randomly take center stage throughout with the insufferable male lead succumbing to the dark forces early on the sinister looking bishop feodor chaliapin resulting a mere red herring the mysterious black priest gradually assuming heroic qualities the leading lady is for whatever reason preyed upon by a goat shaped demon culminating in a sexual rite conducted in front of the other cultists lifted all too obviously from rosemary s baby 1968 and a reasonably impressive 13 year old asia argento as the rebellious but likable sacristan s daughter who emerges as the only survivor by the end incidentally the older argento also co wrote the film s story and screenplay along with director soavi and under a pseudonym after they apparently fell out with dario in the early stages of production original helmer lamberto bava and prolific genre scribe dardano sacchetti whom i met at the 61st venice film festival in 2004 the extremely muddled second half of the film then sees a group of people including the inevitable teenagers but also a doddering english couple whose constant bickering is given an amusingly nasty punchline similarly shut inside a building in the grip of evil spirits the church being the burial ground of a satanic cult not that this horror outing is likely to dispel memories of luis bunuel s sublimely surreal the exterminating angel 1962 you see in the end the film is all the more disappointing though sergio stivaletti s gruesome effects at least are notable given that i had thoroughly enjoyed the only other soavi title i d watched cemetery man 1994 which i own via the r2 se dvd that said i d still like to catch his debut feature stage fright 1987 and the director s follow up effort to the church entitled the sect 1991,0
22752,this film revolves around an arabian leader amir who dies and wants to live on so a dr lloyd trenton is being paid to transplant amirs brain into a willing participant but in the doctors basement his dwarf assistant dorro angelo rossitto drains young girls blood for the doctors purposes so meanwhile doctor llyod pays a man to kill the people who assisted amir into the country which is reed hadley grant williams and various unknown bodyguards grant is the only survivor when his car crashes off the road while this has happened the doctors other assistant gor is sent out to get a body for amir and hurts him so badly dr llyod cant operate meanwhile grant finds amirs girlfriend regina carrol and tells her his story grant sees the man who drove him off the road and dorro kills him then since gor failed to get a body d r llyod puts amirs brain into gors disfigured body then grant and regina go to the doctors lab an spoilers find out his secret soon amir gor are prancing around killing people and in the muddle of what i think is plot dr llyod has a brain ray gun which hurts amir on command it turns out dr lloyd wants a country in which all scientists can work without law so then regina dies and at the end amirs new body i think say that it shall be a new country blah blah i still don t get the ending but overall this was a very enjoyable piece of smelly cheese this film features grant williams in his second to last film roll i recommend it for any fan of al adamson or if you like brains,1

7651,i decided to watch this movie because it has been noted as the scariest movie ever so that s what i expected unfortunately what i found out is that the movie didn t have a single scary moment in it and i m the kind of person who jumps very easily the movie was nothing but terrible clich s and every time there was a jump moment it was incredibly obvious the pros of this movie would be the music and the odd scene thats actually shot well like the very last scene when she opens the door and you see tun in the reflection and when it swings back to him you see the ghost on his shoulders overall this movie really added nothing new to the j horror genre and all around lacked creativity and scares,0

12563,darling lili is a mixture of perfection and magic the stars julie andrews rock hudson could not have done a better attempt if they tried it s full of all the magic that a young lady wishes for and it makes it seem as if it can all really happen to you the brilliance of the director blake edwards is shown to be at his best he was truly capturing the woman he loved on screen the blend of each song went perfectly with the moment in the film the film opened with julie andrews singing whistling away in the dark and closed with the same song by andrews for a film of this excellence to have been such a failure when it was released is a total shock as it is inspirational purely inspirational one of andrews most memorable lines in this film,1
18283,i remember this film as the other person that commented said i recorded over it but wish i had it now just because it had to be one of the worst movies ever funny in a real bad way i remember the tag line on the box was the ultimate frontal lobotomy i got it from my mom who got it from a friend at work who said it was the worst cheesiest movie she had ever seen so my mom said my son will probably love it and the woman gave it to her just to get it out of her possession i then later taped over it which i regret i also remember the corck screw thing was one of those ball catcher things the yellow cone shaped things with a red button at the end and when you hit the red thing it sends a ball flying well they used that with a crank on one end and a corkscrew in the funnel when the killer killed they would show him coming forward with the weapon and then cut to a close up of what appeared to be raw chicken and fake blood on the victims head i don t know what else to say about this gem except that if you like bad films it doesn t get any worse than this,1

8512,i was a still photographer working in europe the summer that jim salter shot the movie three i did some swell pictures for him one of which i was told became the poster for the movie i didn t see the film until years later i thought it was bad a pity because the elements that went into it were compelling robie porter s girlfriend was almast as beautiful as rampling herself salter asked if i would stick around and be an extra cameraman so they wouldn t have to shoot everything twice i said sure but i had to return to ny promising i d be back alas i never did get back one of life s unsung melodies i wish i could post the pictures i made somewhere rowland scherman,0
3863,i could tell this would be a bad one from the trailer but the lure of the dvd box got me to rent it anyway boy was i right also for some reason the dvd version is very fuzzy and unclear at times in terms of video quality it appears as if they shot the whole movie with a 20 year old camcorder it looks so bad i really did not like the plot and after watching the movie i was very let down i will not tell any spoilers but let it be said that the end was so bad that i laughed it has been done so many times before the whole story seems like something that came out of a middle schooler s english paper if i had to peg one movie as the worst horror movie i ve ever seen this one may just be it i can t believe they actually released this film it really isn t worth the rent or a penny of anyone s money unless you want a good laugh at the movie s expense,0
6891,hadn t really heard too much about this movie so i went and saw it i realized that this movie only appeals to someone who has not lived in the real world and even those people would think this movie moved too slowly when the movie opens up you see nicole kidman going to a nudist camp whoa shock that scene the dialouge were all great and then the movie went downhill while i respect the vision the filmmaker must have this movie sucked it was too slow too predictable and not moving enough robert downey jr is great as usual but this movie is not good enough to sit through it tries to be shocking and abnormal but makes poor use of the talents of all the actors don t waste your money even the sex scenes were boring,0
9467,wow the storyline to this was just incredibly stupid i realize that this movie was supposed to be of a comedic genre but still even nonsense is supposed to make at least some vague sort of sense water has become incredibly rare substance well that s strange considering that hydrogenated oxygen or oxidized hydrogen is one of the most plentiful substances there is in the universe and pretty easy to make glomp together hydrogen and oxygen atoms and voil water instead of water the rarity of dilithium crystals or some such thingamajig should have been used as a plot device as something the pirates would go after water as a plot device was just dumb dumb dumb the comedy seemed labored and contrived and forced the comedy in the tv series red dwarf was labored and contrived and forced but it was actually amusing here instead i felt like saying ha ha that was just so funny i forgot to laugh sigh all that money put into sets costumes actors what a waste rather than just whimper and whine and complain at it s lameness my recommendations to make it better 1 use a believable plot device 2 get rid of the comedy none of the actors were really any good at it the movie would work better as a serious action adventure the obvious intention of the writers was to do a spoofy comedy but they didn t quite pull it off it s not likely i ll ever watch this again it s too much a total hack job,0
21478,peter lorre gives one of his most evil performances as the owner of the titled place the plot has a new government agent being put on the track of peter lorre s character when the g man s contact his killed by one of lorre s agents the g man is sent to prison for the killing even though everyone knows there is more to the story lorre has the man paroled into his care and brought to his island where he is mining diamonds lorre wants to know what our hero knows but he isn t talking and a battle of wills is set in motion this is a good solid little thriller that doesn t quite make a great deal of sense plot wise but even so the film holds your interest i had put the film on last night in order to use it as something to drift off to instead i found the tale riveting enough i was up an extra 70 minutes lorre is the reason that one falls into this his quite demeanor is unnerving he does very little but its clear from his orders and the way everyone reacts to him watch how they light his cigarettes that he is a bad dude worth a look if you should run across it,1
5124,without doubt this is the worst movie i ve ever seen poor acting poor script poor direction and poor production why did they even bother this entire movie was total nonsense suspension of disbelief can only carry so far but this pushes the limits completely for a movie with no humour content the audience laughed disturbingly often,0
5984,i m a collector of films starring ms weaver so i bought this only because of her being in it i find it really odd that her early career is filled with so many awful movies she started with incredible promise in alien but then had a slew of bombs these bombs include this movie deal of the century one woman or two and half moon street she also appeared in the year of living dangerously which was not a bomb but her performance was less than notable in the time between alien and it s 1986 sequel aliens the only movie she did that was worth anything was ghostbusters before the release of aliens i m sure everyone thought this woman was on her way out luckily she wasn t back to eyewitness though the film is boring it doesn t create any suspense william hurt seems like a cardboard stand in and the atmosphere is just to dry sigourney is decent but nothing worth remembering watch this movie if you must but don t go in with any expectations of a decent movie watch better movies with these two stars like accidental tourist and working girl,0
13142,i d heard about this movie but didn t see it until my daughter who saw it on a flight to australia told me it was a great movie i was interested in seeing whether rupert grint away from harry potter was showing the promise you see in the potter movies i wasn t disappointed he s become a fine actor showing a range in driving lessons from a shy boy being beaten down by an over bearing obsessive mother to a young man finding himself to be worthy of his own and other s esteem going over lines from plays and poetry with his aging actress employer it s obvious that he s ready to take on much more complex roles in films and the stage but the jewel of this movie was julie walters i d seen her previously in the potter movies billy elliott and calendar girls and loved her in driving lessons as she does lines from poetry and shakespeare i was awed by her timing command of the language and body language i m hoping it was make up costuming as she portrays an older woman with osteoporosis though no mention of it is made in the movie as a nurse i can say that she did this perfectly portraying a woman on the brink of old age but clinging to the sparkling past that she reveled in this is one of the best movies i ve seen in a long time and i wish i d seen it in a theatre first but i doubt it ever played anywhere here in albuquerque we miss out on so many of these types of movies here,1
7455,this movie sucked from beginning to end it was predictable there was absolutly no chemistry between pearce and the mumba chick the plot went nowhere floating off into oblivion all of these led to the movie being very hilarious in its stupidity and i wanted to strangle orlando jones the guy just needs to go away,0
10555,ok when i say wow i mean jesus please help me i have an old vhs copy that was printed before troma got a copy of the title the movie is about an alien crash landing on earth to terrorize us with a gun that blasts people into oblivion watch out and by that i mean watch out for those special effects there is an amazing number of mistakes the acting is terrible but i d say the only one putting forth any effort would be the sheriff the film itself is really grainy and poorly lighted in one particular scene it is day outside and then the shot shows the night beast shooting his gun with night behind him then it shows day again shakes head i usually like low budget horror films but i had to force myself to finish it because i never watch a movie without finishing it the only accomplishment this film achieved was an alien that wasn t stereotypical so for that and only for that i give it a 3 out of 10 don t watch this movie if you ve had a bad day you ll be even more depressed at the failed attempt this movie makes,0
20766,in my opinion the movie is an excellent example of the realities of war and a tribute to the soldiers of all nations who fought and bled into the soil gallipoli the lack of violence in no way detracted from the magnitude of the tale in hand it is honest true and brave just like the men that fought and died at the hellespont the lack of brutal depictions of violence are just and proper those men suffered enough for freedom liberty and the right to self determination in a free and better world they never wished to ever see such scene s again that is the legacy of the event of gallipoli to suffer scene s of gratuitous pyro technics and blood and gore is best not shown for the maintenance of proper respect for the combatants of this crucible of nationhood this film glories in the magnificence of men fighting for their lives with honour courage dignity and irrepressible spirit and humour in the face of appalling adversity this film is not interested in making a spectacle for fools to cheer over the brutal outcomes that occoured from these personal combats of these men is not a thing that those that survived ever wished to see on a screen for entertainment they saw enough of that at the time and would much rather have never seen it at first and never wished to review such scenes again on a screen in the name of entertainment the brutal horrors of the actualities of the vicious combat fought at gallipoli were scenes that haunted their waking and sleeping hours for the rest of their natural days it was the painful internal scars they the men of all those nations who fought carried inside to their graves they all fought and many died in the face of it all and somehow they those mighty hearted men managed to laugh in the teeth of constant dread death because they would nt insult their mates by not being prepared to die game beside them that s australasian for brave game is but it applied to all combatants to a greater or lesser degree but word from the boy s that fought was that johhny turk was as game that is as brave as you would ever wish for a soldier to be anzac s and turks were fighting to establish their place on the world stage and from 25 04 15 onwards their respective claims for equality in nationhood were made known and undeniable to that world the director has made a masterpiece that truly honours the spirit and memory of those soldiers and serves as a reminder to future generations of all ages for children can be taken without fear of frightening them for the sake of visual horror and it s morbid and pointless appeal and children should attend this movie so as to learn what happened at that sacred shore before they were born so that they can remember for it is the nature of men that they soon forget,1
5408,how can you go wrong with a film that mixes the sophistication of peter cushing the determination of donald pleasence and the bust of luan peters easy you give them a terrible script to work with peter cushing in an evil role leads a satanic cult that has captured a couple friends of donald pleasence donald plays a determined but aloof priest that desires to locate his friends but needs the help of fred from scooby doo to locate them he summons the help of a new york bloodhound who dresses just like the hero of the cartoon in his task meanwhile the girlfriend of one of the missing people luan peters joins the search if all this sounds interesting then you like myself were mislead it doesn t take long for the trio to sniff out the baddies but their methods of bringing the bad guys to justice are foolish also women will find this a crapfest every time they get on the bad guys trail our two male heroes tell luan to stay at the hotel even though she can handle herself better than the squeamish priest played by pleasence story the script really lets us down no tension is built no worthwhile dialogue is given the stars and you ll need both hands to count the number of times luan peters is told to stay behind and let men do men work if you re interested in seeing a minotaur on film don t bother we get a statue of a minotaur that spits flames violence there are some attacks and a few sacrifices but those of you who drool for gore will be letdown acting even though there are three of my favorite actors in this film there is nothing redeemable here peter cushing doesn t have much screen time donald pleasence is clearly aware that he is on the set of a stinker and luan peters is ill used this should have been much better given the talent involved but then again the yankees lose a game here and there too nudity luan peters takes a bath but you see next to nothing she isn t as obliging here as she was in the flesh and blood show,0
2898,this seemed really similar to the child s play movies except so much worse a lawyer tries to save a criminal who was convicted of killing his son from execution she fails the lawyer s daughter then finds a puppet that the killer had buried with his son and is immediately attached to it then after several people are seriously injured they find the little girl secretly talking to the doll saying that she didn t hurt anyone throughout this movie i found myself asking myself why am i watching this cheeze over and over the end sucked so bad that i went and watched the disney cartoon version right after and slept with the light on,0

7350,despite decades of tax incentives in terms of international visibility the canadian film industry still lags behind most central african and islamic states surprisingly few canadian films are released outside their native shores and nouvelle france aka battle of the brave is another example of why more than any other country commercial canadian cinema seems unable to develop an identity of its own and is stuck in pale imitation of other countries failures on paper this historical drama could look vaguely promising there s certainly a rich vein of untapped material in canada s history as the french and english warred over and bought and sold the colony though none of it makes the cut here unless you count the odd blink and you ll miss it scene of characters saying wolfe is dead or nouvelle france is no more before getting back to the soap operatics but while this isn t a history lesson it isn t a drama or the epic adventure the new title promises either there is no battle in the film unless you count 10 seconds of shelling by a half dozen re enactors and one collapsed shed the town square that is all we ever see of quebec is a rather obvious flatly lit studio interior giving many scenes an old tv miniseries look as does director jean beaudin s reluctance to offer much in the way of long shots or even exteriors what you do get for your money is a simple but drawn out harlequin romance about doomed lovers constantly separated by events beyond their control where the biggest surprise is that fabio doesn t turn up in the cast it s the kind of film where whenever two characters are about to make the beast with two backs the camera pans over to a convenient raging fireplace or waterfall an anglo canadian french co production that doesn t so much unite once warring nations as throw any country with a decent tax break into the stew this massive box office disaster was clearly intended to be canada s titanic though someone neglected to tell the producers they meant the film not the ship but turns out more like revolution done on the cheap without the battle scenes crowds or the few moments that threaten to briefly work in the face of overwhelming odds the montreal mirror described it as so bad that one can t even find the strength to mock it that s rather unfair because while for most of its running time the film looks like a below par 80s miniseries the last half hour suddenly becomes very funny with characters accidentally putting their legs in bear traps dastardly husbands declaring you ll never see your handsome lover again cuckold s honor you ll pay for this both of you and our heroine accused of murder and gasp witchcraft in a trial funny enough to have been in demi moore s version of the scarlet letter throw in caddish british governors devious slaves and celine dion singing at the end and you ve got something that at times almost feels like the kind of film that timbo hines was aspiring to and still managed to miss wildly with his legendarily inept period version of war of the worlds albeit without the staggering technical incompetence leading man david la haye s versatility seems limited to the number of other actors he can look like throughout the course of the film he starts out looking like andy garcia briefly adopts the al pacino revolution look flirts with the clean shaven tch ky karyo style before turning into a younger ted danson as his character ages while his opening scene where he reacts to news of his father s death with an expression that looks like he s waiting for the director to tell him he can go home now promises a feast of bad acting in reality he gives the impression more of a mediocre supporting actor who s lucked into a lead at the last minute when whoever was originally cast finally read the script and bailed he shows willing and gives it a go but the grace and charisma the part needs just isn t there billie piper lookalike noemie godin vigneau s leading lady doesn t exactly set the screen alight either despite occupying center stage as the peasant girl who is the prey of giggly vincent perez s corrupt and perverted intendant le bigot that really is the character s name the duplicitous goateed drunken lackey sebastien huberdeau and saddest of all gerard depardieu s bedridden revolutionary dirty old priest in a manky grey haired wig it s a truly pitiful sight to see a once great actor at the absolute rock bottom of his game as he shuffles through the motions looking like he s not just lost the will to act but the will to live along with it he clearly couldn t be bothered to stick around for the english dubbing sessions or even a couple of long shots where he is very noticeably doubled small wonder he talked of retiring around the time of the film s brief release some brief comic relief is provided by jason isaacs in his default patriot mode who overplays wolfe of quebec rather like an asthmatic alf garnett archie bunker played by timothy dalton on speed while tim roth s william pitt stands on the sidelines with the occasional bemused smile of one who s being put up in a rather nice hotel with excellent room service and plenty of days off though like colm meaney s benjamin franklin they re both in the film for less than three minutes voltaire and madame pompadour pop their heads around the door for a couple of minutes as well but fail to make any impression comic or otherwise the supporting actresses are generally better juliette gosselin and bianca gervais as the heroine s real and adopted daughters and a strikingly beautiful irene jacob looking for all the world like a young fanny ardant are all refreshingly good and deserve much better,0
10578,yeah a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction now it s a prison again kind of well it s more like an airport mixed together with a junior high school but there are lots of guys running around wearing orange jumpsuits so i guess in that way it s like a prison not really though when sasha steven seagal s character is being admitted into prison he s standing shackled in line and wanders over to a different line so he can talk to his friend like he s in line for the security check at the airport then before too long he and his friend are throwing punches smacking around a couple of security guards let me tell you something you assault a corrections officer in a federal prison they ll shoot you on the spot ja rule would have been shot about 30 times before he threw his second punch oh and there are guys wearing beanies and bandanas and whatnot in prison federal prison you can t dress like that at most high schools in america speaking of ja rule i have to say that the person who probably enjoyed his performance more than anyone else on earth including ja rule himself had to have been 50 cent just before i watched this movie i saw one of those shows on tv about the greatest celebrity feuds ever and like number 7 or 8 was this rivalry between 50 cent who had lived the thug life for real and ja rule who had not every time i saw ja rule on screen the only thing i could picture was 50 cent laughing his ass off ja rule looks like a rowdy 9 year old every time he appears on screen anyway getting back to the plot it s funny sasha is an fbi agent working undercover and he agrees to let himself be sentenced to prison so he can get behind the criminal organization he s sentenced to five years and that old line between determination and stupidity instantly vanishes nothing else in the movie matters after that it becomes a meaningless string of action sequences most of which aren t even well choreographed oh how about this a helicopter crashes through the roof of new alcatraz at one point accidentally freeing all of the inmates and what do they do they all run out of their cells and play basketball in the middle of the cell block without so much as a basket they had a ball but it doesn t matter the scene is so stupid they might as well have been playing hopscotch so some guy is being sentenced to be the first person ever to be executed in alcatraz s state of the art execution chamber evidently not for stealing 200 million dollars in gold but for not telling where it was hidden once he was caught hey good thinking people if you can t get information out of someone kill them that s a great way to learn the truth so some gang breaks into the prison planning to stop the execution and get the location of the 200 million for themselves oh and the 200 million is in gold bricks i doubt they thought ahead to how difficult it would be to turn that into exchangeable currency there s also the issue of the warden at the prison he s some tough talking vato who thinks he s a hardcore chollo from the barrio which reminds me of a joke i saw this comedian once talking about people in california who talk all tough calling each other ese and homes and all kinds of other such nonsense these people go to mexico the comedian says and they re like oh my god people live there that s like a total shack the best is when the united states supreme court justice arrives and this guy tells her that her men can t carry their guns inside his prison i don t care if she is a united states supreme court justice this woman could squish him like a grape and he thinks he s in charge ha and by the way the supreme court justice that gets taken as a hostage in the movie tells the bad guy that she is 53 that s a year younger than steven seagal i just thought that was funny the only good scene in the movie is the one in the prison where ja rule is getting slapped around the prison like a sack of cotton balls by this little asian woman that was the funniest thing i ve seen in a movie in a long long time you know i work for the company that produced this film which i why i watched it and i still don t have a single positive thing to say about it except of course for that one scene with ja rule getting spanked by that asian woman so read my review of malena and you will see how strongly i sometimes disagree with professional film critics like roger ebert but in his review of this movie ebert wrote something that i agreed with as much as anything else he s ever written i imagine the flywheels at the mpaa congratulating each other on a good day s work as they rated half past dead pg 13 after giving the anti gun movie bowling for columbine an r way to go guys,0
8838,this show is the worst show ever norris and his family write it produce it direct it etc etc the only reason i ever see it is because my goofy wife likes it how many times can norris fly though the air from plain sight to land a kick on an obviously blind villain no trees no building just whoosh thin air he always solves the case or is the best at whatever skill there is no co star ever gets the glory its all norris its truly apparent that norris is awful stuck on himself and will not allow anyone to one up him in any scene no matter what the content terrible acting terrible script terrible series,0
13717,this was a very good ppv but like wrestlemania xx some 14 years later the wwe crammed so many matches on it some of the matches were useless i m not going to go through every match on the card because it would take forever to do however major highlights included the huge pop for demolition winning the tag team belts from haku and andre the giant the first ever mixed tag match featuring randy savage and sensational queen sherri vs dusty rhodes and the late sapphire and the first ever clash between the ultimate warrior and hulk hogan some matches were a complete waste of time like the bolsheviks vs the hart foundation was only about 40 seconds long koko b ware vs rick martel was short and big bossman vs akeem was too short mr perfect vs brutus beefcake and ted dibiase vs jake the snake roberts were very good indeed overall grade b,1
20008,i had the pleasure of watching this two chairs down from one of the executive producer at the atlantic film festival which was interesting because he laughed at very different times than the rest of us filmed in atlantic canada the movie is about three teen aged girls who in one of their last summers of their youth devote a large deal of energy to sleeping with a married 30 year old man despite much protestation it s definitely worth a watch but the humour was geared a completely different demographic than the one i inhabit male 18 25 so i was shaking my head at the character s antics rather than laughing inspite of this the story is strong enough to hold up for itself make it entertaining without so much laughing,1
12362,director michael ritchie and actor robert redford s second documentary style drama the candidate is a political satire that still seems fresh and pertinent today so it s a pity that downhill racer made a short time before seems so dated by contrast the music is ugly and the perhaps innovative ski ing sequences are now standard in televisual coverage of the sport the world of ski ing seems strangely amateurish probably accurately given the time the movie was made but it s hard to relate to today s professional world and the theme of americans in europe likewise seems hundrum in an age of ever easier travel perhaps the biggest problem is the flat plot centred on the arrogant but enigmatic hero unfortunately it s a dreary performance from redford offering us little insight into his cares or motivations and a character driven film without much of a character is never a good bet i expected much but sadly this is a boring movie,0
22073,this is apparently the first film featuring gloria swanson the film that made her a breakout star while she was good in the film i can t see how this performance in particular was so noteworthy at the time but still it was a very good film gloria plays the wife of a rich slob that continually takes her for granted he cares little for his grooming eats onions and forgets their anniversary and at the same time a lothario comes into their lives and begins paying a lot of attention to gloria and her dippy husband doesn t even notice or give her any reason not to cheat on him ultimately she divorces her hubby and marries the smooth talking romeo however while the movie could have just been an overdone melodrama they were pretty common at the time it takes some interesting twists and turns and is an imaginative and fun film while not the greatest silent film i have seen it is a standout and deserves to be remembered by the way the dvd release from image entertainment is surprisingly good with a decent print and music this hasn t always been true of other image releases particularly how sloppily they handled the chaplin releases,1
12606,the dresser is a small but absolutely wonderful film brilliantly acted by albert finney and tom courtenay how in the world this tiny film attracted enough attention to garner five major academy award nominations back in 1983 is a mystery to me but it s nice to know the academy can be guilty of a display of good taste every once in a while of course they gave the award that year to terms of endearment after all they don t want to be accused of showing too much taste albert finney is a drunken shakespearean actor in a production of king lear tom courtenay is the man who works double time behind the scenes to keep this actor in front of the footlights it s both hilarious and piteous to see courtenay s character showering finney s with attention and affection only to see his efforts utterly unappreciated and dismissed even up to the very bitter end finney and courtenay work wonders together and though finney gets the showiest moments he does get to recite shakespeare after all courtenay is the heart and soul of the film grade a,1
12894,this film is superb wesley snipes plays blade the vampire hunter with pure class he kicks butt in such a fluid and violent way that would make bruce lee proud the movie is a fast paced thrill ride of action and superb stunts the first action scene and last are outstanding and wesley looks like a terminator as he runs around wiping out all suck heads the script is pretty good and there is sharp dialogue too wesley should have done more action films than he has i know he is a very good actor and in this he is not streched as much as in his more comic or drama roles but as far as action stars go he is the best actor of them all only bruce willis stallone and perhaps tom cruise if he counts as an action star come close also aswell as wesley being quality steven dorff is also very good as the bad guy it was an unexpected surprise that someone of small stature compared to snipes should come across as menacing but he does overall the film is sharp stylish and i hope the sequal is done with the same sort of pace,1
15843,i first saw heimat 2 on bbc2 in the 90 s when i was at art college living and moving among artists and musicians hoping for future success so the second home of friendships made after leaving the familial home of striving for a professional excellence strongly resonated with my living reality i was captivated by the characters the storytelling the lyrical camera work and above all by the music in it i could divine the beginnings of german electronic music of 50 s stockhausen kraftwerk can neue faust of the 70 s the sound experiments of john cage walter carlos and the british electronic psychedelia of the white noise the soundtrack composer nikos mamangakis studied with carl orff of carmina burana fame so i found its tastes contemporary to the electronic pop sound effects world i hadnt seen heimat or heimat 3 so i watched it as a whole in itself without a before or after as someone else has commented it is both epic and lyrical historical and artistic many favourite moments including the wonderful voice of gisela muller evelyn the bach marimba of daniel smith juan the piano playing of henry arnold hermann and the cello playing of salome kammer clarissa i could write more but it s already been said here why can t british or us tv produce such masterpieces the wire had the realism and politics and epic sweep of a city david lynch and dennis potter had imaginative tropes to their serialised tv work too but this is art house and soap at its most cinematic and narrative sublime it s never included in critics choices of best films but it should be still as poetic and powerful as when i first saw it over 17 years ago i watch the 3 boxed sets every autumn for their mellow fruitfulness inspired and inspiring,1
11928,i am having a hard time finding the words to explain just how much i detested this movie the historical trial of henriette deluzy desportes and the duc de praslin is a tragic and compelling story that i feel had the potential to be a fantastic film but failed although the cinematography certainly had something to say for itself it in no way could make up for the terrible structure of the film the badly written script and most of all the horrendously overacted characters the worst of them were the duc s children who were so over the top corny and sickeningly fake that it was almost painful to watch in conclusion this film left me feeling nothing more than irritated and profoundly disappointed,0
10738,when i first saw this movie in the theater i was so angry it completely blew in my opinion i didn t see it for a decade then decided what the hell let s see i m watching all hellraiser movies now to see where it went wrong my guess is it was with sequel 5 that was the first to implement the whole i am in a dream omg i see weird stuff oh noes what is happening oh its a dream oh its not a dream oh wait i see something spooky oh never mind sucky storyline those sequels don t even require the box to be opened or stick to the rules from the first 4 movies that if you saw pinhead you are pretty much screwed and dead the first 3 hellraisers sticked to this storyline which made it so scary in the first place nothing fantasy nothing weird the box got opened boom they came kirstey was the only one that could bargain her way out of it first because of uncle frank then because she had information about the cenobites this movie at least attempts to stick to all that even though it was a bad story it was still somewhat hellraiser no i m pretty sure part 5 was the first part to completely and utterly destroy the hellraiser series now they are remaking 1 and i don t even think i will watch it oh who am i kidding i probably will and probably will be disappointed again,0
22481,this is the very la nouvelle vague one of the best films of the new wave and i dare say one of the first ten ever made why the atmosphere the story the actors actress are all brilliant this is the theater a fairy tale the life the film paris thank you mr rivette,1
863,a box with a button provides a couple with the opportunity to be financially free but the cost is the life of someone they ve never met this is a very tedious film to watch richard kelly who wrote and directed it decided to make a film without any payoff you are taken on a ride of slow build ups one after the other with minor revelations at best at certain moments i thought to myself this will have major significance at the end but nothing does the film just leaves one thinking this story could have been told in 30 minutes without all the stretched out nonsense i will hope you avoid this god awful film and maintain your sanity by doing so,0
19327,i don t know what it is about this movie the charisma of the two leads their chemistry on screen the chance to see matthau s real life son you can t miss him or art carney s performance but i love it i ve seen it a few times and never tire of watching it again rent and enjoy,1
17442,you ve got to think along the lines of last tango in paris for this one because the mood and emotion runs along the same lines and maintains the same heights the difference being that in this exceptional intense and torrid depiction of love among the ruins of a dostoyevskyian dispossessed the setting is a gay subcultural milieu perhaps even one that is set to vanish in time and not the equally arresting but heterosexual context of bertolucci s own film the last third of this film depicts a passionate love never seen in gay cinema to talk of pornography or gay self effacement misses the point and intelligence of this work this film though on first impression appears to take us into the familiar often depicted underworld of gay street life then precedes to subvert the rules of this genre by exaggerating it to a super real degree the result is a hyper charged emotional heightening an exceptional strategy that elevates the drama to one of big universal themes and giant gestures this film snatches the high ground because of the brilliant performances by it s actors notably a young jean hugues anglade and the directing a tour de force of cinema outstanding in ambition and it s unceasing plummet into the depths of human emotion as a contribution to gay cinema this film conquers this difficult ground and makes it it s own triumph,1
23307,more and more french cinema demonstrates that s the only one able to confront hollywood s and to spend high amounts on money in their movies if bon voyage had been made in the usa no one would be surprised perfectly set in france in the 40 s when the nazi invasion technically irreproachable and with some of the most international french actors depardieu adjani ledoyen bon voyage centerers on two parallel stories an scientific and his disciple ledoyen who tries to hide one of his discoveries a kind of water that may work as an atomic bomb from the nazis and a poor guy in love with a well known actress adjani which ends up in prison accused of a crime he s not committed in order to protect her bon voyage seems to have been made in the old style without unnecessary camera movements and effects without big turns in the plot as i said before regarding to the production itself they ve made a great job but the main problem with this movie is about the script is it a spy movie a romantic comedy a spy comedy a comedy of intrigue it s not clear that makes bon voyage a little unbalanced when you think you re watching a comedy suddenly changes to another story line a more dramatic one more slow i think they should ve focused in one of the lines of argument the one about the spy plot and left the romantic parts in the background my rate 6 5 10,1
16755,could contain spoilers read only after seeing last episode season 2 think about it the guys on the north pole center of the earth looking for abnormal magnetic behavior they also said something about did we miss it again so there was another abnormality of course that was when the plain crashed i think this whole island is a setup set up by her daddy she found out about it and is looking for her desmond how else can she know what to look for so basically it s an island in a magnetic shield all of it is fake all the signs are there fake beards fake doors fake medicine fake observations stations with fake air shafts that lead to nothing it s a project indeed and because of the final scene in the season 2 finale i know it has to do something with desmond his chick and her dad and probably libby she s weird maybe she actually has something to do with the plane crashing ok now i m drifting off also in this episode henry gail tells michael to go to some coordinates and he ll find rescue their this is probably some sort of door in the magnetic shield once you re gone there is no way back i think it s pretty obvious despite of the numerous questions i still have and hope to get answers for in the next season if you think back on what we ve learned in season 1 and 2 i m sure we ll get loads of answers in season 3 can t wait can anyone agree on this theory hope to hear from you,1
5596,i just wanted to leave a quick comment as its not listen on here but i have just seen this movie the version i just rented was released in 2005 as far as i know and it was actually called don t go into the attic i only realized it was the same movie as devils harvest upon searching for some of the actors who looked familiar in the movie anyways i m in ireland so maybe this has only been released over here and in the uk now but thats what its called over here not really like it matters because i would not recommend this movie the only words that spring to mind watching it are cheese cheese cheese my one mark out of ten is purely for the one little jumpy bit o,0
559,all those who are into the pc culture are aghast at the dogmatic christian view of this film claiming it contains racist ideation and or religious intolerance those who don t care about this but are oriented towards slick production values and competent acting are dismayed at the lack of such here those who decry both of these are apoplectic that this production was let loose on the general public as evidenced in comments here what is an interesting premise which isn t original but is a combination of ghost and from beyond is dealt with in a rather immature manner in this film yet done with gusto what the crew and actors lacked in sensibility professional abilities and technical expertise is somewhat offset by the intensity they display it isn t nearly as bad as many here think and would have been fine in the hands of someone with maturity and common sense and it is enough below mediocrity to elicit laughs and groans however it unfolds with enough intensity to keep interest throughout and is close to on par with a corman produced entry of his earliest period of work or the material of arkoff or sam katzman if you get it for 2 or less as did i you won t feel disappointed but will wish you could have had a say in how it was made,0
12658,i watched this series after i had seen the naked gun films i found it much better than the films and i thought the films were great this series literally glues you to the television set in anticipation of the next pun sight gag or funny situation the all night wicker place club flamingo i don t think i ve ever laughed as hard at a tv series in my life even after seeing the movies first and thus knowing some of the jokes i think its a shame that only six episodes were produced but i agree that the writers would be very hard pressed to maintain this level of comedy for any more episodes overall the series is a must see for those who like puns bad jokes and slapstick sight gags,1
23939,you can t watch this film for a history lesson this was the first i had heard of the ma barker saga but i could tell almost immediately that the facts were way off and with a little internet research i realized i was of course right ma barker sure as hell isn t the sexy calculating woman the movie portrays her as and apparently did not orchestrate all the bank robbing schemes kiddnappings and murders that her criminal boys carried out but don t expect a brilliant crime drama the script and the acting are adequate the gunfights are excessive and mostly unrealistic and there is a very laughable slow motion death scene so why did i give it a 7 out of 10 because it was damn entertaining the gunfights are fun to watch but there are some deeper themes that emerge between them the movie has a strong sense of ego intimidation among it s cast of alpha males each of whom has his own agenda and i appreciate the minimal use of swears for the period the set pieces are great reproducing a convincing 1930s era so watch this film like you would a cult film and take the excessive bloodiness and ruthlessness in stride with the cheesy ultra serious comments from the fbi man who wants to take the barkers down at any cost inotherwords don t take it too seriously just have fun with it and if you like this you ll love serial mom,1
17728,hoot is a nice young person s film about a group of middle school kids that try and keep a pancake house chain from bulldozing a plot of land that is home to some endangered burrowing owls the acting is pretty good and the fresh faces are nice to see many well known comedians are in this film and keep the humor going almost nonstop it is a film for the young crowd perhaps 5 to 11 years of age i thought it was a nice change of pace from the adult films that pervade the screen these days there is no realism here or accuracy about life in general for adults or kids it s just a bunch of fun with a constant message about saving the beautiful places in this country from becoming over developed if you can remember back to the day when you weren t fight for a buck you may remember that money isn t everything not many people over 12 are going to enjoy it unless they really have a soft spot for the old after school special series,1
4363,the previews were so funny that i couldn t wait to see this movie i just got home and i have to say i couldn t have been more embarrassed at this movie yes there were times where the jokes were funny but the stereotypical roles were painful joan plowright is a fine actress but the scene with the negro spiritual was just in poor taste needless to say the laughs were few and far between in the movie house for a largely white crowd i was one of a very small handful of blacks,0
5188,rise of the footsoldier follows the unrelentingly cruel journey of gangster carlton leach and his associates through drugs violence sex violence guns violence and did i mention violence protagonist carlton leach ricci harnett member of the i c f inner city firm a group of football hooligans turned professional gangsters guides the audience through the events leading to the 1995 range rover killings in which three gang members fell victim to particularly vicious professional hits leach s success as a doorman and talent for locating aptly violent friends to control unruly punters at a local nightclub launches him into the company of notorious drug dealers and gangsters profitably benefiting from the 80s 90s rave scene and drug culture opening with brutally realistic shots of the dead men the viewer is left thirsty to understand what happened but left wholly unsatisfied the next 2 hours meander through a series of countless character introductions each of these basically establishes yet another typical hard man shows him assaulting usually undeserving victims before probably coming to an even nastier end what little emotional understanding the audience is allowed to form for a few of the characters for example a family man blamed for missing drugs is quickly destroyed when they are either anti climactically killed or their storyline left unresolved the hints of a plot introduced in the beginning are inadequately concluded with vague impressions of how the murders occurred as the events are slotted into place with little reward for persevering with the hazy muddle of previous events this film has been made with a standard formula in mind for an audience who prefer violence and ard nut slang to an actual storyline rise of the footsoldier borrows too much from football factory leaving out the good bits demonstrating no moral ramifications of hooligan subculture or establishing empathy with the protagonist the violence although brilliantly shot seems excessive and implausible because no one is around long enough for the audience to form an emotional attachment the implication that the gangs are untouchable by the police is fair enough but machete wielding doormen regularly committing blatant murder in public places pushes the imagination of even the most willing viewer the audience are left bewildered as to the relevance of many key events and developed characters that had no knock on effect on the eventual conclusion attempted gritty realism is further destroyed with a substance called truth serum which the turkish mafia use to coax honest answers from unwilling individuals this is not the genre in which to invent psychologically unrealistic drugs and renders the interrogation almost absurd the actual scenes of violence before becoming repetitive hold some tension spliced with rapid flashes of colour or the end of a film reel seamlessly choreographed brawls coupled with obligatory but effective shaky hand held camera work saves the film but unfortunately the plot or lack there of limits it to a niche demographic in essence the events this film is based on aren t deservedly represented and an adequately sequential storyline is sacrificed for stereotypical characters and an unoriginal plot this film has a place in the market but if you like a bit of brain with your brutality this one isn t for you http www obsessedwithfilm com,0

17976,have just seen this film in australia on satellite as i have been avoiding the news more so than usual over the last week coming from the us of a regarding gunmen well to be absolutely blunt this film is a prescient gem a big bravo to all involved i had only a small idea of what the film entailed as is most often the case for good effect and this certainly came up with cinematic goods the setting of the scene is effective in the truest sense of the word with all the hairy confronting subjects of today s world in relation to one s own faltering family albeit suburb the first forty minutes sets such a professional theater i was not ready for the out loud laughs when they came although the cathartic moment built via comedy and character as the family and neighbors came together in an extraordinary way all in all a foreseeing of who and what we are a most meaningful film and a must see please note the date of this review,1
8669,man oh man this was a piece of dog sh t i read a few reviews on here after seeing the case in the local video store and thought to myself ah this seems like a half decent movie vampires swords thailand how can you go wrong right no no no way f cking wrong jesus if only i could gouge out my eyes and not remember this film i would be happy the lead actor had the whiniest gayest voice ever man it really was bad amandaaaaaaaa i gotta save my girlfriend f ck off my buddy and i actually changed the audio track on the dvd to portugese just so we didn t have to hear the guy s voice subtitles and all and this improved the film i m serious if your anything like me and wondered what this film was like stop wondering i have the answer worst vampire movie ever no good action no good gore and only the smallest smattering of nudity just pure sh t for 90 mins don t rent this buy it think about it or watch it at 3 00am it just doesn t cut the cake at all in any way f ck this movie and watch all anal 7 real deep cover you d have a better time i m sure,0
2950,evil never looked so bad they meant it when a buddy of mine picked this dvd up at a half priced book store i didn t know what to expect i mean based on the title i knew it would be worth a laugh but i didn t realize how laughable it would really be the first time through i missed some of the dialogue if you could call it that because we were all too busy poking fun at the plot of the movie it seemed like it was written in filmed in less than a week and they hadn t the budget to go back and fix some of the minor flaws wait did i say minor i meant the exact opposite for instance the main character is credited as ken but several times throughout the film he is referred to as john if the plot holes aren t enough fun for you take a look at the acting nobody seems overly concerned about the zombie raids in their state including the mother of the main character who is missing for days while she sits in front of a fireplace reading a book the constraints that the budget puts on the movie are equally as hilarious maybe they didn t have a permit to film wherever they were because during the big motorcycle chase scene the characters are obeying all traffic regulations the zombies who had just killed twenty or so people actually stop at a stop sign coming out of a parking lot i don t even do that but then again i m not a biker zombie the ending of the movie looks like they just ran out of money it ends so suddenly that it leaves you wanting more on second thought it ends just soon enough so if you re looking for a good time with your friends seek out this movie it s a great unintentional comedy,0
10893,it seems to be a common thing in the 90 s to play with cliches some manage to do so with great talent herv hadmar doesn t on the paper the movie looked interesting though the weak plot could have been saved by great moments of comedy dark humour and a very d cal style director hadmar unfortunately kills his direction with his camera angles and his absolute lack of rhythm every joke is embarassing as no one reacts in the theater the movie is incredibly slow and the actors seem to be wondering what the hell they re doing in this ridiculous mascarade what could have been a stylish funny mindless comedy ends up being a cathedral of boredom,0
5645,man did this film stink it s obvious this film helped spurn hollywood s need to churn out tired sequels to appeal to the masses first of all it came out too quickly and second of all it just didn t have the same hipness which made the original film so successful no new ground was broken and it turned into a rather mundane effort,0
404,80 s sleazy glam rock is like 90 s house music or current boybands it s boring and has no ideas or ideals the only thing that makes it a bit cult nowadays is that it s a long time ago so we can laugh at its sillyness too bad rock star has no laughs at all as it must be one of the most boring movies of recent years chris mark wahlberg is singer of a steel dragon tribute band when he s kicked of the band at the same time the real steel dragon singer is kicked of as well he becomes the next lead singer you already know how this is gonna end up at that time with chris losing it with sex drugs and r r and forgetting about his long time girlfriend manager emily jennifer aniston there s way too much boring music in this standard formula packed excuse for a movie and should be avoided for it at all cost watch the over rated but still more fun almost famous instead or even better a movie about real people playing real music having real emotions that thing you do what a stinker 2 10,0
7186,the hills have eyes is not a great film by any stretch of the imagination for one the villains look almost normal not what you would expect deranged lunatics to look like for another the pacing is very slow at times and there are many scenes of the characters repeating themselves by that i mean there is a lot of filler in the movie with a lot of running around aimlessly the film didn t have a clear direction the plot of the movie is hardly original even for its time the texas chainsaw massacre came out a few year earlier and is a much more effective film as far as horror goes the film has little in the way of scares and the pounding soundtrack just served to be both grating and distracting all at once i suppose the music was used to cover up the fact that not much happens through much of the movie though it failed in its intended purpose i basically kept looking at the time every few seconds hoping something would happen or it would end when something finally did happen any promise the film had was ruined by mere chaos and loud noise i sat through it because i like to give a film the benefit of the doubt yes there is some loud screaming and yes people die but who cares much too slow getting to any sort of pay off if you can call it that my buddy enjoyed it so at least one of us got something out of it the hills have eyes isn t the worst film we could have watched but i doubt i will watch it again this film was remade in 2006 and i will also have review of that version anyway this movie was painfully slow at times while other times was chaotic and repetitive unless you like watching paint dry occasionally interspersed with someone running around your block screaming their head off stay away from this movie a better bet would be the original texas chainsaw massacre 1973 1 5 out of 10 which is being generous,0
15070,this show is amazing i love each and every episode carrie is a spitfire and doug is a lovable and at times a moron arthur spence danny deacon and carrie s boss add just a nice end touch to the show tying up all of the funny pee in your pants moments in one of the seasons doug tries to get carrie drunk because she is nicer when she is drunk nice husband right carrie isn t much better when her boss needs a ips driver to testify in a small case at her job carrie hesitates because she views doug as a slob and doesn t want him to embarrass her so she hires doug s friend instead wife of the year but who i believe to be funniest is yell at random arthur he is drop dead hilarious and angry hey you would be too if you had to live in a basement where the mold has a funny smell and makes you dizzy this show is hilarious and if you haven t seen it yet then you haven t lived,1
14384,i don t normally go out of my way to watch romantic comedy and maybe i will in the future after seeing return to me the plot was simple and no secret after the publicity you don t have to be einstein to guess what will happen after the first 15 minutes what you can do is relax and let the cast take you into a world where the chemistry abounds and the good guys win and you can just laugh and have a good time i love this movie and have the dvd on order,1
13442,i just had to add my comment to raise the average on this one paul giamatti lets it all hang out in this one and is a hoot he would probably say it was easy but he really does a great job and should have won something for it we ve had the dvd for several years and my kids boy now 4 1 2 and girl 9 will watch this one over and over and the humor is adult enough that i don t mind having to hear it in the background and i do run to the tv for the really funny parts simple moral message lots of decent action and slapstick bad grownups acting goofy to take the edge off minimal bad language and minimal potty jokes make it hard to beat for a family standard,1
17097,five characters in search of an exit clearly has to be one of the more clever and better twilight zone episodes ever made because of it s abstract ideas and thoughtful plan where the characters have to search to discover identity and it ends as a surprise you have a military major a female dancer bag pipe player a clown and hobo who all awake together in the bottom of a wall and none know how they got there and they don t know who they are so the episode starts out with very interesting drama and suspense from the very beginning making it so soul searching for the viewers interest to want to know the characters true identity and backgrounds plus the episode even adds more intrigue for the fact it places different types of characters with different views and lifestyles all with one goal in common to escape and find identity and peace that s very compelling for the viewer only in the end i don t want to spoil for those who haven t seen a surprise fall happens proving that many times you might want to stay where you are away in your little sheltered world and be away from the masses of other people s world as you will see the characters are loved in a different way by people in a much different form really great and cleverly done a real shock twist surprise that makes the viewer see the unexpected and cruel fate that happens sometimes when you search and seek,1
9588,the boys were the most appealing things in the entire movie the girls were lame and pathetic i mean how can they own their own clothing line dolls movies producing studios and not smell this bomb from far away in order to gain some sort of responsibility which i dont really see the sense in the punishment they are sent to paris far far far away from home to live with the so called strict grandfather who holds an important standing with paris i cant really remember what he was so who really cares the detail doesnt help the girls are sent to paris to learn something so what exactly do they learn when they meet two french boys and are able to manipulate the guy that supposed to watch them so they can meet these guys on scooters the typical pre teen movie having all pre teens wishing to misbehave and be able to afford the trip to paris or some far away country away from parents i dont really like the olsens anyways they never could really shake off the image of michelle on full house in case you didnt see that then you were lucky from the start f f,0
19334,a horror picture set ultimately to parody but still in it s play out could scare a few of those that are frailed nerved or easily disgusted when they see whats under their skin i laughed at it though it was easy to decipher the true killer and his acting didn t help this only led to potente looking even better anatomie is not much of a horror picture for those foreign of the genre but those contained should get a few unintentional laughs and an interesting peak at german horror cinema 6 10,1
10677,norris plays a chicago cop who stumbles upon a devil s apprentice who wants to well create armegeddon he eventually kills the creature by get this throwing a solid gold 24 inch spike not very sharp about twenty feet hard enough to penetrate the chest unlikely so is the rest of the movie much of it consists of cn and his sidekick driving cars and talking nonsense the israeli or arab kid is there ostensibly to humanize cn ok doesn t work makes no sense and advances the plot so called not one bit also no cops ever every get invited out of the country to be interviewed by other cops it is ridiculous as a premise the whole thing is bad unfortunately it s not so bad as to be entertainingly bad or campy just plain bad but one can see how norris was trying to find his way to the successful walker texas ranger series,0
18959,a skillfully directed film by martin ritt where a drifter and anti hero john cassevetes lands in n y to escape a tragic incident in his life where he killed his brother in an automobile accident as well as going awol from the army cassavetes always an intense actor shows grit in his portrayal of a film am surprised that montgomery clift didn t get this part ruth white is his mother and does remarkably well in two scenes on the telephone once in new york he befriends sidney poitier as the two work on the docks immediately jack warden a bully and villain in this film takes a dislike to him and tragedy ensues when poitier tries to defend his friend ruby dee plays poitier s wife in this film and is brilliant in a scene where she urges cassavetes to reveal the killer of her husband this is definitely an interesting film of moral values and the loner in society with the backdrop of tenements the right mood is depicted in the film,1
19589,i don t play video games at all but my children do i got a big kick out of this would like to see more of this type of film very cool as my youngest would say interesting characters and the overall story line was interesting like i said i don t play video games but i think that my children would enjoyed this it was not full of bad language and that is a pleasant change this visual concept was different which caught my eye plus the sound track was pretty good i might even try out some of the games my sons plays to see because of this film who knows maybe i ll be a gamer someday,1
17366,too much added with too much taken away from a great western that was written by mcmurtry about the texas rangers vs the indian this screenplay takes that away only to fill this mini series with a lot of warm fuzzy relationships that in truth were secondary to the main storyline it ends with a totally unbelievable and detached ending not written in the book that makes you question how we are to be transported to lonesome dove the series main characters were in truth cast very well the filming locations were excellent but this mini series should have stayed true to what is a great book,1
830,this is a classic example of what happens when a sit com is on tv for far far too long everything gets tired and the jokes start getting repeated over and over again ok from the start the first couple of series were quite good you had an entertainment manager simon cadel being pursued by his deputy played by ruth madoc a cleaning lady wanting to become a yellow coat an alcoholic child hating punch and judy man a bent jockey and a stand up comedian as said earlier it started well but went on way too long once simon cadel left it went downhill fast you were getting dire story lines and a new entertainments manager who ruth madoc again threw herself at when a comedy is all filmed in one place there is a limit to the number of jokes that can be cracked unfortunately this went on so long every joke was cracked 3 or 4 times over if this comedy had been stopped after 2 series it would have gone down as an all time classic as it is it will be largely remembered for the dreadful last few series,0
12220,we arrived at the theater too late to see rendition which was our intention and the comebacks was the only film that hadn t already started i had an inkling of how bad a film it was after reading the short blurb at the ticket counter the theater was empty when we arrived and only two other people entered before the film started the screenwriters and director threw every imaginable sports clich at the audience without creating a single laugh not one during the entire movie think of all the football movies that have been made and the millions of dollars schools and fans spend each year on football and you realize how ripe it is to be parodied or lampooned if you add texas to the mix you ought to come up with the sports version of little miss sunshine not a big yawn the first film that came to mind as we exited the theater was can t stop the music by comparison this was can t stop the music without bruce jenner valerie perrine or the village people if the film had a single grace note it was seeing matthew lawrence grown up,0
14582,i ve been a fan of heaven s gate since its first release i ve seen it at least half a dozen times and have long thought of it as a masterpiece so it was with excitement and a sense of anticipation that i took myself off to see the restored director s cut to my surprise i was disappointed on seeing it again and have since revised my estimation of the film heaven s gate touches upon greatness in parts but overall lacks the thematic and narrative consistency and the passionate urgency characteristic of a truly great film firstly two technical problems the sound quality is diffuse throughout the film verging on inaudibility at times some of this perhaps is intentional a way to mimic the chaos and confusion of history as it is unfolding but at key points one is unable to register what it is the characters are saying the cinematography is similarly diffuse the images lack sharpness and particularity of detail the result is a certain graininess and lack of pictorial sharpness which succeeds in blurring foreground and background structurally the narrative is off key throughout as if cimino can t quite make up his mind as to the effect he is after he wanted an epic for sure but a pastoral or dramatic epic the film sits uneasily and unconvincingly between styles and perhaps even genres at times it reminded me of terrence malick s days of heaven or even elvira madigan in its languid pace and elegant scene painting at other times it threatens to turn into a robust western more akin to the wild bunch in fact the latter film offers an instructive reference point for an assessment of heaven s gate as it shares the same period concern and employs a similar tone of ambivalent nostalgia for a darker yet more heroic america this structural and thematic uncertainty isn t helped by the poor quality script which often sounds forced and jarring to the ear the result is an inauthentic sense of period speech the near greatness of heaven s gate resides in its set pieces the roller skating sequence in particular is astoundingly beautiful one of the most evocative scenes ever put to film another set piece which works very well in terms of unifying theme mood and setting occurs when kristofferson and huppert go riding in the new rig to the lake and she washes herself while he naps in the shade the languid pacing evocative music and monumental scenery combine in this scene to convincingly portray the love story which might just lie at the heart of the film and which could have been its saving grace if pursued more convincingly some critics have complained about the length of the film this in itself doesn t bother me a good film can t be long enough the restored minutes are critical in restoring the motivation and characterization absent from the cut version and they are full of pictorial interest perhaps the chief glory of heaven s gate lies in the achingly evocative soundtrack the repeated waltz motif and its different scorings throughout full band guitar solo fiddle etc lends a haunting quality to the foreground action and establishes a thematic consistency lacking in the narrative itself despite its obvious flaws most notably the absence of a compelling narrative there is a sense of grandeur about the film one leaves the cinema with a rueful sense of missed greatness and a wish that cimino could revisit the film with the wisdom of time and hindsight to put right what is so badly amiss,1
11632,i absolutely hated this movie even though the movie wanted to transmit some kind of social message it was done in such a clich ridden and melodramatic way like a mexican soap opera also the acting was terrible especially charityn and her son that s one of the problems with dominican movies they use celebrities that can t even act just to attract the masses i m even more ashamed about the positive reviews here which sadly means dominicans are just being condescending to what s done here instead of giving honest and critical opinions that will help our film industry base itself on quality,0
21945,crossfire feels like an underdeveloped masterpiece it s well acted and beautifully filmed but thinly written and way too short as is it s just a decent police procedural with hints of film noir at its zenith in 1947 and social commentary also trendy at the time thrown in for good measure it s remembered today as one of the first two hollywood films to deal with anti semitism and as being much better than the similarly themed gentleman s agreement no mean feat but its real subject is the difficulty that wwii soldiers as trained killers were having as they made the transition to civilian life for a more genteel take on this topic try the best years of our lives a man is beaten to death in the first few frames of the film we do not see his attacker the movie is about the investigation of this murder which is actually pretty straightforward but it takes some unnecessary detours like when the main suspect a depressed soldier winds up in the apartment of gloria grahame a dance hall hooker with a really weird pimp played by paul kelly there s also a civics lecture halfway through the movie that slows the proceedings to a crawl and the ending is tidy enough for a cop show but otherwise it s a pretty decent mystery still what a great noir it could have been director edward dmytryk drops a few hints at the subject of the original novel homosexuality not anti semitism like when sadistic creep monty seethes at the image of his friend mitch talking with a strange man at a bar and the cast is excellent robert ryan makes for a very credible cretin and even becomes a little sympathetic in his final scenes not unlike peter lorre as the child murderer in m he deserved an oscar but lost to edmund gwenn that year you can t beat santa claus robert mitchum is onhand as a soldier friend of the accused killer was mitchum a great actor or a great star someone else can figure that out but his sleepy eyes and bemused half smile work very well here since they imply that his character knows something everyone else doesn t and he does and robert young as the detective assigned to the murder is surprisingly gritty discarding his usual avuncular affability even when he has to deliver the civil rights sermon midway through the picture there s no question that bogart or tracy would have been brilliant in the role but neither of them were at rko in 1947 so you ll just have to deal with dr welby still young is good enough to make you wish someone had cast him in a detective drama instead of father knows best which he hated and which drove him to alcoholism and suicide attempts the man deserved better than smarm and sanka,1
9540,i am one of those people that respect every film maker as having achieved each film i watch i usually respect although i admit i select carefully and appriciate for what it is not any more this is truly one of the worst scripts i have seen produced as a film so much so i felt compelled to warn others off it the dialogue was truly unbelievable the main protaganist was about the last person i would be interested in finding out more about a scene were an old school friend tells it like it is made me laugh only because it was a pathetic attempt to reveal the subtext of an already concluded plot the direction is glib at best and at worst film making by numbers to compare this film to the atmospheric majesty of a film like five easy pieces is a travesty,0
16603,it s just that chucky 1 was good chucky 2 was better chucky 3 sucked now the 4th in the series which is in my opinion the best out of the series jennifer tilly was just great in this movie for dolls they were better than a few actors that come to mind freddie prince jr for one and funnier than many comedies i ve seen in the past the plot wasn t great but i really didn t care about it just to see chucky and tiffany bicker and fight each other and the ending leaves it wide open for a 5th sequel which i hear is in the works idle hands premiers next week and looks to be another horror comedy but i doubt it ll top this one,1
6265,awful wot more can i say i remember seeing it in the cinema see how it sticks painfully in the memory as a 16 yr old lad mark hamill was the older generations skywalker and wasn t great at that he was worse in this plus a dour soundtrack by then jericho aaaaarrrrrrgggggghhhhhh there is one film equally as bad as this i saw in the cinema arthur 2 on the rocks funny how that question what is the worst film you have ever seen is is easier than what is the best film which incidentally varies between the italian job original untouchables casino things to do in denver goodfellas getting a sense of what i like this will fool you finding nemo pirates of the caribbean and moulin rouge please never watch this film or it will stick in your memory too,0
13230,when i first saw this film it was about 1956 and even though i saw it again recently i have not changed my mind about it i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real life my father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt my mother and brother had to do this when i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed,1
21993,i ll admit that i ve never seen waiting for guffman 1997 s critically acclaimed comedy mockumentary about a small town thats that stages a pageant when the advertising for best in show had the tagline from the team that brought you waiting for guffman a fair number of critics out there implied in their reviews that only people that are familiar with the film or its filmmakers and cast would have a good time seeing this film for shame critics for shame times two any critic that implies something like that with any film probably doesn t want to share the film s wealth with the rest of the world but this is one film that i hope people will experience now that its video dvd best in show is without a doubt the best comedy of 2000 the film begins with a mockumentary style introducing the main competitors not to mention screwballs of the annual mayflower best in show competition where dogs of all breeds come to compete to see who is the top dog we have the loveable and gullable harry pepper guest with his bloodhound the simple gerry cookie fleck levy o hara with their terriors nut case yuppies hamilton meg swan hitchcock posey the gay dog groomers scott dolan stefan vanderhoof higgins mckean and the airheaded millionare sheri ann ward cabot coolidge along with her trainer christy cummings lynch they all have their minds on one simple object the blue ribbon which will be awarded to the best dog and do i have to tell you the rest director writer star guest s idea of humor is one that assures me that there are comedies out there that are worth laughing at and that the idiocy of films like american pie or other pointless teenage flicks won t take over the world after all his idea is simple make your comedy not just funny but smart funny but instead of following in the brilliant footsteps of films like zero effect and high fidelity he used a rather unusual approach and as i understand he also used this approach for guffman whether you notice or not a very large part of the film is improvisation in other words what the actors say and do were probably not written in the script maybe even not even dreamed of by guest and co writer star levy but with a gentle hand from guest he and the actors pulled off a hilarious theatrical feat that probably would have flopped if handled by other less adept actors now that s smart the cast is of course what makes improv work the most all of them are a comedic marvel to behold especially guest as pepper but the real standout has to be fred williard as buck laughlin the clueless announcer at the competition who can spin out the most outrageously funny stories and comments that no announcer would even dream of that is if the announcer was trying to be funny williard can go from talking about the dog to suddenly going on and on about how much he can bench press there s even a part were he gives out an idea for a new marketing strategy have sexy women pose in tight shirts and shorts with the dogs and imply something like have a doggie style of a time its priceless as is his performance i hope that people engage in this 90 minute dogumentary the film deserves so much recognition it did get nominated for best picture comedy at the golden globes but didn t win i can t see why i mean in the comedy department it is best in show grade a,1
19940,i think this movie is underrated to me it felt like a gulp of fresh air some people complain about the implausibility of the plot overlong sequences and lack of sex the latter being i believe the main reason for implausibility and how come there are no drunken teenagers talking dirty but it s just not their thing and good for them if they can t relate to the story the performances are great i d really like to see more of the actors in other movies the emotions are genuine the whole unrequited love thing is presented with uncanny subtlety and it does give you the tingly feeling you expect to get from a good movie,1
16607,it s always a good feeling when a movie delivers the goods when you weren t expecting it the dead end kids bowery boys found themselves in a lot of uneven films and usually did better when in a support role as in angels with dirty faces here their presence as a backdrop to the story of a boxer framed for murder gives them a lot of screen time without distracting from the main action john garfield is light heavyweight champion johnny bradfield a southpaw hitter who s a lot different from the image he portrays to the sports world and the press when a newspaper reporter inadvertently learns that johnny s a party loving womanizer his plans to spill that information in a column is interrupted by a whiskey bottle to the head from johnny s manager doc ward robert gleckler in turn doc talks johnny s girlfriend goldie ann sheridan into running off with him to avoid the legal hassle of dealing with the reporter s death as both flee a police chase winds up in a fiery car wreck and doc s body is misidentified as johnny from the gold watch he was wearing claude rains adopts an edward g robinson sneer that doesn t quite work as a detective who s been reassigned to morgue detail after a bad arrest years ago his character is monty phelan and he has a pretty good hunch that the body in the car crash wasn t johnny he pesters his boss to hand over the closed case to him and is given the assignment to get him out of town and out of the way meanwhile johnny looks for advice from his lawyer and winds up being screwed even worse when he gets conned for most of his ten thousand dollar savings making his way cross country johnny winds up at the rancho rafferty date farm in arizona run by a crusty granny rafferty may robson the farm is the legacy of granny s brother a deceased priest from brooklyn and is now the home of a band of rag tag street boys the dead end kids who work the farm billy halop is the nominal leader of the boys in this one and his sister peggy gloria dickson becomes the romantic interest for johnny now going by the name of jack dorney i get a kick out of the historical perspective offered in these pre war era films when johnny and the boys take a joy ride in the farm s truck they fill up at a gas station for a 1 28 tommy halop gets the idea that a gas station on the farm would be a good way to earn some extra money and with that thought jack dorney decides to take on a barnstorming boxer offering 500 a round to anyone who can stay in the ring with him the clich d premise is turned on it s ear somewhat when jack gets knocked out in the fifth round but by then he s earned enough to give the fruit farm a fighting chance of it s own maybe grandma rafferty should have been in the ring she just about took out everyone sitting around her at ringside as johnny jack comes around in the locker room detective phelan is on hand to take him into custody knowing that he can redeem his reputation with this collar it s a toss up as to whether phelan follows through on his arrest you ll have to watch the film to find out i like the dead end films where leo gorcey s in charge but he doesn t have a lot to do in this one however he does a great film flam on the ticket taker at the gate of the boxing match another thought wouldn t it have been great if the ever present picture on the wall of the priest had been that of pat o brien all in all this is a pretty good entry in both the john garfield and dead end kids filmography and an entertaining way to spend an hour and a half if there s one downside it s not enough screen time for pretty ann sheridan the film might have wound up even more satisfying if the roles of sheridan and gloria dickson were reversed as the on screen chemistry between dickson s peggy and jack seemed more forced than natural,1
23747,this has become one of my favorite movies and certainly one of the best westerns i have ever seen having a soft spot for the genre westerns are or were since they are no longer made very often morality plays that too often have been denigrated by critics with intellectual pretensions i purchased the dvd sight unseen because i had read enough about william s hart s work much of which he wrote and directed to pique my interest and thought i should have at least one of his films in my video collection i must admit that i approached the actual viewing with some trepidation my previous experiences with silent cinema classics had left me feeling let down chaney s the phantom of the opera griffith s birth of a nation and fairbanks the mark of zorro were fine but not nearly as good as their reputations would lead one to expect they were either too long or too theatrical or both the toll gate however emerged as a pleasant surprise it is a story told in a simple and straightforward manner black deering played by hart leader of a notoriously successful outlaw gang thinks the time has come for group to disband before its luck runs out he is however opposed by his chief lieutenant jordan who goads them all into one last holdup by promising great wealth but leads them into a trap in which he is complicit everyone is killed except deering who is taken prisoner when his captors recognize him as the man who once saved a number of soldiers and settlers by warning an outpost of an impending indian attack they allow him to escape free he tries to find honest work but is snubbed and ridiculed and ultimately must rob again to survive soon he is pursued not only by the sheriff s posse but also by jordan now prospering from the reward money he has collected and his henchmen his flight leads him to a remote cabin inhabited by a single mother and her little son after some initial misgivings they take him into their hearts deering sees a chance for a new life but with the posse and jordan closing in realizes that this may not be possible hart was the first great western star and the first to inject realism into the genre as one of the pioneers of movie making he created many of the characters and situations that have become clich in westerns for more than ninety years what keeps his movies interesting however was his ability to go beyond the clich perhaps his imitators did not go far enough so that the material appears fresh and innovative even now three such instances in the toll gate illustrate this 1 in one scene his character shoots into a crowd in an attempt to kill jordan and kills a bystander instead a subsequent close up shows that he is clearly frustrated the frustration however comes not from the fact that he has gunned down a man who had hitherto caused him no harm but that he missed his intended target 2 in another as he flees from the posse his borrowed horse steps into a gopher hole and breaks a leg hart pulls out his gun to put the animal out of its misery but before pulling the trigger gives his head a sad loving pat as if to say farewell to an old friend 3 and finally after he has strangled jordan and thrown his body over a cliff he returns to retrieve his guns and spots his adversary s pistol lying on the ground nearby he steps forward and gives it a swift kick before mounting his horse it is a simple gesture but it underscores the deep loathing he feels for the man who betrayed him and his comrades and i love the title the toll gate it is allegorical in its implication that a man cannot begin a new life until he has paid for the sins of his old one deering s payment comes in the form of sacrifice today s more sophisticated audiences may not buy into that sentiment entirely but it can still work on you if you let it viewers who like their videos in pristine condition will undoubtedly object to the dvd s picture quality especially the badly deteriorated final reel i don t mind at all that a copy of this 1920 movie even exists at all is a miracle since prints of so many other silent movies have been lost if you bear that in mind and look upon the film as a piece of history its visual flaws are not that difficult to accept william s hart was born in 1870 in new york but grew up in the minnesota and wisconsin where he learned to speak sioux and indian sign language he counted wyatt earp and bat masterson among his friends and collected remington paintings so his knowledge of the west was first hand if his vision seems overly romanticized by today s standards it is nevertheless rooted far closer to reality than the spaghetti westerns of the 60s and 70s and the revisionist works that followed both the star and his films are overdue for re evaluation,1
6731,this movie starts out with this creepy song that gave me some chills like the song used in nightmare on elmstreet it immediately sets the mood the sequence that follows also shows what to expect we are made aware that a ghost is present the mystery concerning this ghost is what keeps this movie together but the structure of the plot is so complex that it is difficult to make sense of it the ideas behind the plot are quite interesting only the way it is told to us is far too abstract i understand that the director believed that he had to maintain the mystery as long as possible the problem is that when certain matters get revealed you never get a satisfying explanation the motives of the important characters are left out and some questions raised in the movie don t get answered at all since we don t learn enough about the characters it becomes hard to care for them and as a consequence you will loose interest only some scares and a twist save this movie from becoming a total failure the twist is interesting but no real shocker the experienced viewer will see it coming some reviewers complain that this movie is too much like ringu and is not original at all well it is true that some of the effects and scares are borrowed from that movie but there is a main difference the suspense in ringu mainly was based on this one twist where the viewer finds out how the characters get killed in ryeong the ringu like twist is used as a creepy effect to accompany another crazy twist ryeong heavily depends on a complex structured plot and twist that doesn t contain enough scares to hold your interest simply put this isn t a scary movie,0
20931,spoilers ahead for the first ten minutes or so of star witness we re introduced to a quote typical urban american family unquote in a nameless city which is another way of saying warner brothers version of nyc except for the young children including the charming dickie moore and sprightly sally blane they re a pretty dreary lot and their dinner table conversation is tedious and we wish the story would move along and bring in the star walter huston but wait folks wait all of a sudden serious gangster movie action breaks out drawing the family in against their will and after that this baby never lets up there s suspense an oscar nominated script good acting everything you want old movies to be it is here i do question chic sales performance he must be an acquired taste but his presence turns out to be crucial to the plot he s treated to special status in the credits so warner bros must have really been high on sale but how his corny old man routine fit in with the public then is something lost to me perhaps it is lost to time period an unknowable factor you had to be a 1931 moviegoer to understand also the climax is typically melodramatic nevertheless this right now is the best release of the studio that year i have seen so far however i ve only seen eight so perhaps that s an inconclusive view do not miss this when tcm shows it 8 out of 10,1
22217,the undoubted highlight of this movie is peter o toole s performance in turn wildly comical and terribly terribly tragic does anybody do it better than o toole i don t think so what a great face that man has the story is an odd one and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in parts especially toward the end but it is also oddly touching and does succeed on many levels however i felt the film basically revolved around peter o toole s luminous performance and i m sure i wouldn t have enjoyed it even half as much if he hadn t been in it,1
17408,iron eagle has always been one of my favirote films for a long time now it looks like topgun but with a different plot and a lot of people will disagree with me here in my view it s better than topgun this film has some amazing dogfight scenes when the fighter jets are zooming through the air it also has the queen song one vision thumping in the background which in my opinion is a fantastic song to be honest iron eagle was very good but it s sequels were rubbish,1
19304,although it has been off the air for 6 years now promised land was one of those shows that comes along once or twice in a generation good cast supporting cast among them richard thomas and ossie davis and crew the plot is believable with mcraney packing up his family and just saying to hell with it all after being subjected to so many disappointments and incidents since his return from vietnam years earlier i think a lot of vietnam era veterans myself included could really relate to mcraney s thought process in finally deciding on his course of action many of us did precisely the same thing in real life after returning from that war and finding that america was not the same place we left the show imparts not only values but a glimpse into what took place in one veterans life in those two respects alone i think it is one of the more poignant tv series of our time why this program only ran for 3 years is beyond me,1
23523,film follows a bunch of students in the nyc high school of the performing arts there s coco irene cara a black singer who will make it to the top despite everything she s helped by bruno lee curren a white musician then there s doris maureen teefy who wants to be an actress but she s shy and scared she becomes friends with motgomery paul mccrane purportedly the only gay student in the school and is romanced by raul barry miller then there s leroy gene anthony ray who sadly died in 2003 who s homeless and a great dancer but can t read then there s various teachers albert hague anne meara stand out trying to teach the kids the songs are great the title tune and out here on my own were nominated for best song fame won the dances are energetic and the young cast shows plenty of ambition and talent but this film misses the boat in the drama department many plot lines are brought up and completely left open ended by the end of the movie why did coco do a porno did doris and raul remain together afterwords did either make it how about montgomery what happened to him and did leroy ever graduate and how there are too many long speeches raul has two and moments that just lead to nothing i m assuming there were cuts in the script i can t believe the movie just left all this open still it s worth seeing for the acting and again the music there s basically not one bad song and the dances go full force and at one point stop traffic literally my favorites are fame out here and i sing the body electric which is a great closing song so i recommend it but can only give it a 7 the script really needed to tie up loose ends and it didn t trivia they wanted to shot this film at the actual school for performing arts but couldn t get permission the dean of the school read the script and said there was way too much swearing in the film that is true there is a lot of foul language but that s how high school kids talk avoid the tv version which abysmally overdubs it,1
2190,though some would prefer to comment on the value of bond movies in the connection of learning frequency and while most of the jargon that tends to limit bond to a meager 007 following has been exploited beyond all reasonable contention there are several redeeming plausibilities that extend the credibility of sean connery in this doubling role that had seen its counterpart adaptation in part of a previous performance by jessica tandy in driving miss daisy while connery had been less visible in the latter his woman seeker qualities had maybe not cast a frown on the face of embittered spectators as it would in this latest rendition which to most involved approached the 007 theme with kind resentment albeit while the general flavor had been altered great for those who interest others while faking to be who you re not,0
8837,the fact that this cruddy series could elicit dozens of comments much less hundreds of votes speaks volumes as to the decline of western or at least american civilization read proust you morons or at least dave barry or calvin and hobbes anthologies chuck norris wrap your brains around the fact that in order to rate or write about this series you d have to have spent minutes nay hours viewing this poor sod treading the boards and spewing lines with less emotional impact than the gal who used to call off the correct time on your local service please don t watch this show spare your few remaining brain cells,0
14253,i just finished a double feature night of an american werewolf in london paris let me start by saying london still holds up after all these years and the transformation sequence is by any standard quite impressive the film was funny and scary also a bit of gore now lets get to paris its enjoyable a few scars lots of gore not as exciting or eerie as original but it does have a few laughs in what has become quite the fashion these days in films so maybe in that sense it was ahead of it s time the transformations al a cgi while good for the technology of its time are nowhere near as impressive as the original i gave this movie a 7 because i have to admit it was enjoyable i laughed a lot and found tom everett scott to be so silly that at first i wanted to dislike his performance only to end up liking it go figure julie delpy was competent as was the direction it s the script that lacked a bit of shine finesse i read here that john landis was supposed to direct to bad he didn t i am quite sure it would have been a different movie altogether i also noticed some discussion of a sequel what if well no one has noted the obvious it should be in american and here is my title an american werewolf comes home or in dc that would be fun all those political dogs need a good scare you simply must see the original in it s new dvd transfer with dolby 5 1 sound and see both of these on an hdtv with upconvert turned on nice,1
22560,the film is excellent one of the most noteworthy things about it is that flynn s performance is superb this is worth stressing as he was often derided as an actor by bette davis et al i remember the scene where flynn gets arthur kennedy drunk in order to take him to his doom at the battle of the little big horn the cold calculating look on flynn s face as he does so is extraordinary much better than the much vaunted spencer tracy or many other stars could have done the other thing to note is the excellent performance by george p huntley jr as lt queen s own butler it is baffling why he stopped making films shortly afterwards one would have thought that he would have been set up for years after as a character actor,1
18708,despite later claims this early talkie melodrama has very little in common with citizen kane it s a biopic of a ruthless but human fictional plutocrat told in flashback but hopping around time the scriptwriter preston sturges shows none of his later gift for sparkling dialog and none of the myriad cinematic innovations of kane are evident still it s very watchable with a young spencer tracy his old man makeup makes him look just like well an old spencer tracy showing depth and authority and colleen moore a little past her prime and not physically well matched playing a multifaceted woman behind the man there s also helen vinson as one of the most treacherous femmes fatales in movie history sending the final third into ecstatic soap opera reverberations the surviving print is jumpy and has missing audio snippets and there are some plot holes left open how would she know whose son it was if she s sleeping with both of them and the music is awfully hokey for all that i was quite fascinated,1
8154,i probably have to blame myself but i sure as hell expected more from a movie that goes by the title black dragons and revolves on secret wwii conspiracies nazi plastic surgeons and revenge this film is a dull failure with an incomprehensible structure the actual plot which basically is rather ingenious and intriguing only becomes clear during an explication near the end but the problem is that you stop caring a long time before we see how horror icon bela lugosi infiltrates in a society of prominent american politicians and kills them one by one the story is timed right before wwii and especially after witnessing the ending it surely is a premise with lots of potential so it s quite a shame it isn t elaborated more proper there is however one great dialogue that i can t resist sharing man towards woman do you want to marry me why so i can beat you up it s the only way you ll leave this place it s the only highlight in an overall very boring movie bela lugosi is lovely as usual but his spooky performance alone is hardly worth purchasing this film if you re interested in seeing other ghoulish performances of his in movies with decent screenplays check out invisible ghost the corpse vanishes white zombie and of course the 1931 dracula version,0
24289,i have seen this film more then once actually el padrino was one of the best feature films that i have seen in a great deal of time there was a big cast jennifer tilly faye duanway brad dourif and damian chapa who really shined like a real star in this part of kilo i heard this film was shot for under two million dollars i have seen films shot for 33 million that cant compare to the quality and production value damian chapa why are you not getting offers and more film work excellent job i cant wait to see the sequel and i hope it has the same action jennifer tilly has made a cult classic character with sabeva damian chapa moves coolly in every scene much like the movie stars of the 40 s and 50 s so sick of seeing these non charismatic actors like ben stiller getting all of these films when there is talent like this that have something to show a great film go go go kick some but in sales el padrino,1
22704,lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock s black and white low budget original nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master s stable,1
14728,excellence seems to come rare in hollwood today many consider just two out of the year s best picture nominees to display sense to the movie industry and in everything is illuminated the mark is hit directly the film initiates its brilliance with the beautiful setting the scene entry from the beginning you receive a sense of warmth and true family connections and relations between one and another and also the cast is introduced perfectly for elijah wood s character jonathon his sensibility is expressed through holding his dying grandmother s hand and for the character entitled alex it is easy to see his life in his perspective the true ukrainian rock star with the cast illuminated at first the story slowly eases into our minds as jonathon decides to venture to ukraine to meet the woman believed to save his grandfather thus the entire family and from there the story movies slowly yet kept at a fast pace from the contrast of tear dripping drama and laugh out loud humor included in scene by scene every scene although the movie itself is rather awarding there are several complaints from other sources commenting about liev schrieber s inaccurate adaptation of the jonathon safron foer novel personally i have never read the novel but any movie especially this movie in particular should not be graded on whether the storyboard of the film matches the storyline of the book but rather how the major concepts from the novel were expressed and exploited through the film just because it may be far fetched from the novel does not mean that this film is no longer a must see it still is throughout the film new information inundates the audience s mind very slowly some of these thoughts are never answered and in fact the second half of the movie refocuses its entire topic and reason of travel through ukraine onto something different yet rather similar to the original intentions of this film the film does however leave you on a satisfied note yet to the weak hearted souls a tear may be dropped and throughout the film to the saneful people with common sense of humor may just have to laugh from alex and john s fun and ongoing conversations i would recommend this film to several different types of people to those whom enjoy movies that share the genre drama comedy for those who have an interest in family connections and to those whom have an interest in holocaustic subjects and to those insane people who find slapstick as hilarious comedy this movie is not for you and for you whom think that this is a seriously funny and absolutely ingeniously funny film you are wrong this film shares comedic moments and dramatic sequences and to those whom judge a movie based on their likeliness with its corresponding novel you may or may not enjoy this film but this film should be taken for much more than whether or not it was close to the book all in all everything is illuminated is an ingenious piece of work that will enlighten anyones hearts,1
3419,jack frost 2 is out of the question i m actually surprised people are allowed to make these sort of movies as sam and his wife take to the tropicana for a relaxing christmas jack returns to kill off the fun and take on a revenge with inbreeding don t take a swip at this film at all most people say its a laugh with your mates but frankily its a waste of time if the people who made this film can get a job by doing what they do they can at least take the time and effort to write up a better story especially the cheesy character names,0
11125,this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing i have to admit that the whole audience i was in was laughing hysterically but the majority were greek or italian so i guess that this humour will probably make them laugh but not me all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes god and i can never get that 90 minutes back,0
827,undoubtedly the least among the spaghetti westerns i ve been watching lately basically a low brow rip off of leone s the good the bad and the ugly 1966 with three disparate characters outwitting one another and occasionally forming shaky alliances in their search for hidden gold leonard maltin rated it a bomb while it s harmless enough it s also totally routine and fatally the three main roles are stereotypes that is to say uninteresting eddie byrnes is a bank employee with ideas regarding his consignment being transported by train gilbert roland is the legendary but ageing mexican bandit his frequent lapses into spanish when excited are quite corny who apparently is still irresistible to women george hilton as an enigmatic bounty hunter tries too hard to emulate clint eastwood s man with no name figure director castellari whom i saw at the italian b movie retrospective held during the 2004 venice film festival where he came off as the most pompous of the cult movie directors present shows little genuine feeling for the western on the strength of two above average franco nero efforts in the genre i ordered his collaboration with castellari keoma 1976 i m keeping my fingers crossed now and the film s tongue in cheek approach is equally lamentable,0
20056,the many comments made by others have been very informative and i join in their calls for the release of porgy and bess the 1959 film in my early teens i joined a record club and this album was one of the free ones i chose for joining i knew some of the voices were dubbed but only robert mcferrin was acknowledged on the album recently my daughter purchased a cd from austria i think the quality is excellent so i am confused about why it is available in europe by cbs records inc when i have had no luck in local stores actually i never saw the movie but for years have pleaded with local video stores to get it now i know why it has never been available i add my voice to others who plead with the heirs of the property and rights and that they agree to release it however imperfect they perceive it to be the beauty of the music and story reached so many of us who would never have had the experience otherwise trudy,1
14256,this movie is not as bad as some say it is infact i think it s more enjoyable than the original maybe that s why some people hate it as much cos they dont want to admit it s a good not great movie most if not all fx were done by c g i which i didn t mind at all cos it was an enjoyable movie phil buckman chris was in my opinion the best guy in the movie julie delpy was rather attractive she brought the sexiness to the movie there were a lot of wisecracks in the movie which i thought were good this movie is in my collection but the original is not because i dont like it as much as this one i was not bored when i watched this movie it kept me watching unlike some horror movies i could mention like oh say driller killer suspiria dario argento s movie thats to name but two this is an ok werewolf film it should be in people s collection if they like werewolf movies maybe i ll get the original at some point maybe i have only one complaint and that is phil buckman chris should have been in it more than he was but apart from that the movie was fine rating for this movie 8 10 an ok werewolf movie not the worst one out there,1
19640,i m not american but meatballs still really hits me maybe because it s a sweet sweet movie watching it again today made me sentimental for a time i can t really put my finger on and a place i can t quite remember meatballs is just a great movie it reminds me of innocent days when nothing really mattered and anything was possible if you re reading this you probably know what i mean all i can say on top of what i ve already said is that meatballs must be even more nostalgic if you re american i guess you know what i mean by that too,1
98,like singin in the rain cover girl has a trio of two guys and a girl in cover girl phil silvers genius is the comic relief he corresponds to donald o connor s funny man part in singin in the rain in cover girl gene kelly s love interest is rita hayworth and in rain it s debbie reynolds that s where the comparison ends whereas singin in the rain is a classic american movie musical cover girl is mediocrity incarnate the story isn t very complicated rusty parker rita hayworth is a dancer in danny macguire s low rent nightclub in brooklyn rusty decides to enter a cover girl contest sponsored by a wealthy publisher john coudair who made an unsuccessful play for rusty s grandmother years ago coudair introduces rusty to broadway producer noel wheaton who makes her into a star danny feels slighted when rusty starts showing up late for rehearsals at the nightclub and decides to close the club down and go on the road entertaining the troops along with his sidekick genius at the last minute with rusty at the altar with noel she realizes the error of her ways and runs back to danny they live happily ever after gene kelly has the least developed part in the movie all we find out about him is that he owns a nightclub and is madly in love with rusty coudair and wheaton act like besotted teenagers toward rusty and phil silvers delivers some thoroughly goofy but unfunny shtick the most interesting aspect of rita hayworth s performance is the scene in which she gets drunk this foreshadows what happened to her in real life anyone who has read her biography will learn that she disliked hollywood pined away for a normal home life which she could never attain but eventually began drinking and ended up with full blown alzheimer s during the last years of her life almost all of the songs in cover girl are old fashioned and not very tuneful gene kelly has only one really excellent dance number and that s the scene where he dances with his alter ego earlier the trio has another number which is a pale precursor of make em laugh from singin in the rain the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal a couple of decades later raquel welch had the same problem both actresses later in their careers would always try and find scripts that showcased their acting abilities they wanted to be known as actresses and not pinup girls unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain,0
4499,the game of hockey i play and watch has something called speed which the actual hockey scenes in this limp movie never even come close to capturing add to that a storyline that is clich predictable and stupider than stupid with some of the lamest 80s music numbing your senses in every scene and you have youngblood oh keanu as a french canadian yeah whatever gimme dunlop braden and the hansons anytime one out of ten,0
9827,going into the movie with the right expectations i somewhat liked this movie like most reviewers who have seen this movie i fully agree that the plot was razor thin clich d and i could predict every plot twist from the very beginning of the movie but the dancing sequences were very well done and i really enjoyed the fusion of classical and hip hop dance both which i enjoy watching the music soundtrack of the movie was also very good which made the drama scenes more bearable the leads jenna dewan and channing tatum were ok as actors but their dancing throughout the movie was impressive and mesmerizing all in all a movie worth watching if you like to watch good dance sequences and this movie is much much much better than you got served in terms of the plot and drama then again that doesn t say much does it p,0
24402,i just got the dvd for hardware wars in a shiny new package looking irresistable stuck it in my dvd player to find a slew of extra fun stuff the extra content on the dvd is even longer than the movie for those of you that have shame never seen hardware wars it one fantastically silly star wars spoof of episode iv of course household appliances such as irons toasters vacuums and a waffle maker stand in for ty fighters x wings r2d2 and the death star instead of princess leia we have princess ann droid complete with cinnabon hairdo you get the point i m sure mad silliness and a fun ride for any star wars geek like me now the dvd wow a director s commentary where he basically goes off on the movie making fun of himself and the project throughout an interview with fosselius on creature features remember that and hilarious director s cut and foreign version of the movie all jokes of course anyway this is great i loved hardware wars in the theater and am so glad for having the dvd in my collection wedged in between mst3k the movie and thumb wars,1
21283,i enjoyed this programme immensely it is exceptionally well written with finely judged performances and clever visuals it is also very frank and honest refreshing compared to the sanitised representation of drug use in films and television unmissable one of the finest television shows of recent years and triumph on all scales for channel 4 9 10,1
22221,i saw this back in 99 and i remember loving it still to this day i can remember parts of the movie in my head like the slanted pitch unfortunately from 99 now i could never remember the name of this until i was looking through the filmography of a friend of my uncles and came across this he played clive kennard straight away after reading the description i knew what it was after catching up i was shocked to find out that not only did it not make a release on video or dvd but still has yet to be repeated this is a massive shame i am begging you itv at least repeat this superb tv movie nick hancock showed in this movie he could do more than just host a show with his character mike tonker this is a movie that most football fans would love and even those who aren t too keen on the sport would be able to enjoy the comedic value of this yes this is a brief review but there is not much to say apart from this is an underrated movie deserves to be repeated or released on video dvd so itv myself and other fans of this movie beg you please consider one of those,1
13900,i just finished watching following and i thought it was great i rated it 8 out of 10 i plan on watching it again with the director s commentary and then again in chronological order i rented this movie because of my fascination of christopher nolan s more recent movie memento following has some similarities this movie was probably the blueprint for memento even the music in some parts is very similar shooting the movie in black and white gives it a mysterious feel the story and dialogue is really good the performance of the actors is believable christopher nolan made this movie on a really low budget i look forward to his next release insomnia a big budget movie with my favourite actor al pacino,1
1605,i have seen most of john waters films with the exception of several of his very early ones which are not available i have actually seen just about all of them so it s obvious i am a big fan and it s certain that i have a high tolerance for the gross and irreverent in his films while way over the top and disgusting i adored female trouble and polyester two monumental tributes to bad taste and excess that are seriously funny films so i am certainly not squeamish and can take most of what waters has to offer however in pink flamingos he has created a film so repellent so unfunny and so offensive that i couldn t even stand it in his other films he made before he became more mainstream they were funny yet here the humor just isn t there as it seems the intent is to shock the viewers and not entertain them in any way i am glad that after making this film waters sense of humor improved as divine consuming dog feces as in this film is shocking but not the least bit entertaining my advice is to skip this film and just pretend it never happened and then watch his infinitely better films of the 70s and 80s,0
24178,this movie is based on the book a many splendored thing by han suyin and tackles issues of race relations between asians and whites a topic that comes from han s personal experiences as an eurasian growing up in china that background and the beautiful hong kong settings gives this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time other than that the story is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that is perhaps more remembered than the movie itself the beautiful jennifer jones looks the part and gives a wonderful oscar nominated performance as a doctor of mixed breed during the advent of communism in mainland china william holden never looked better playing a romantic lead as a journalist covering war torn regions in the world the acting is top notch and the chemistry between the two lovers provides for some genuine moments of silver screen affection sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined the cinematography really brings out fifty s hong kong especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments the ending is a real tear jerker some may consider sentimental romances pass but for those who enjoy classic hollywood love stories this is a shining example,1
4143,this movie was horrendous it had absolutely nothing to do with dark harvest and the dvd was very misleading because it showed a scarecrow and a scythe neither of which appeared in this movie the beginning was a jumble of random scenes that most of which had nothing to do with the movie except that they sort of show that the man is psychic but not too well after the first 10 minutes of the movie there is an hour of just the man character looking for his daughters it gets vaguely interesting when the daughters meet two girls who died the year before but that s the extent of it and why might i ask was this movie rated r there were two drops of blood and 4 curse words and how on earth did it get into a video store this movie was poorly acted poorly filmed poorly written and overall horribly executed,0
1959,well it is about 1 000 years in the future and we have finally breached traveling the vast distance between galaxies but sadly we still use guns that shoot bullets black men are still calling each other brothers and getting high stoned fighting etc common stereotypical urban black men are still getting the short end of the stick babes in tight black rubber pants that look like they re from baywatch share close quarters with the captian and crew crippled people still require wheelchairs to move no fancy cures implants or robotic legs dracula still looks and acts gay need i go on in short this move was shot on a typical sci fi set low budget props actors and no real special effects to speak of the beginning the middle and the ending was pathetic i have to go off and shoot myself now there is nothing left to live for,0
8445,this film is terrible and don t blame jesus franco because its not his fault this film was shot silent over many years by welles as he got the money to bring a crew and the actors together to do some shooting how much film welles actually shot is not clear although not all of the film or all of the sequences are here since several key sequences such as quixote in a movie theater are in the hands of collectors or backers who wouldn t give them up the film here is just under two hours and i would be hard pressed to imagine it ever really working at any length i m of the opinion based on several comments that welles made before his death that he never really intended to release the film but was putting it together as a personal toy what exists here is for the most part is beautifully shot but dramatically dead very little happens for the first hour other than quixote and sancho wandering around the country side dull would be a kind description of the material in the second hour quixote ends up in modern spain and in a series of not very good sequences deals with everyday life this isn t to say that there isn t a few nice moments the windmill and the chicken sequences are quite good but mostly this is a vast waste of film and time completed by jesus franco who was welles assistant director on the vastly superior chimes at midnight we have a bunch of film fragments that have been put together as best as possible many people have crucified franco as having been the reason the film stinks but frankly one can not make a good movie from crap material one critic has gone on record as having seen a different cut of the film in the 1970 s which meant that franco made this version up on his own and ruined it while that maybe true i ve run across stories of welles cutting and re cutting the film many many times over the years since he could never get it right this film is terrible no matter how you slice it ultimately i m left wondering just how good a film maker welles was aside from citizen kane almost all of his films have been plagued by lack of budget or interfered with so we are left with the excuse that many of his films would have been better if only how do we know how can we know perhaps welles was a man of less talent than we thought and many of his borderline films just aren t that good and never would have been while this is no place to argue the place of welles in film history the surviving material of don quixote assuming it approximates what welles intended i think it does is a good case for rethinking how we view the man and his work 4 out of 10 for the good sequences though 2 out of 10 is probably closer to reality,0
24573,i enjoyed this for a couple of reasons the emotional tangle was at times confusing and imperfectly resolved but the blend of newsreel footage with the film s narrative was often compelling the other element that i appreciated was the depiction of the werewolves the fanatical nazis who continued the fight after the formal surrender i don t know of another film that deals with them they assassinated burgomaster oppenhoff of aachen on palm sunday 1945 for example and did create problems for the occupation the film then challenges the sanitized version of victory and occupation with some gritty realities the human issues are presented not so much through the characters here but through the historical reality that was gripping those who had survived hitler both conquered and victors,1
23141,the marriage of an upscale new york city couple with child falls apart when the wife wants out it took a lot of courage for her to walk out that door a neighbor tells us the busy distracted husband takes on the motherly responsibilities and grows closer to his son but soon the wife returns highly manipulative picture doesn t give us a very realistic familial unit with young justin henry certainly not resembling the product of a marriage between dustin hoffman and meryl streep but the dynamics are intriguing and involving and director robert benton keeps the pace popping with lots of cleverness marvelous classical music canny editing and surefire bits of humor streep s character is designed to be a cold self centered witch but i was ready to feel a lot more for her than benton probably wanted it all has to be painted in terms of black and white good and bad with hoffman learning how hard his wife had it and getting a second chance at being a good parent the film never falters from its preconceived path and very fine acting nearly saves it but i m not sure where benton was steering the film in the final act and the closing scene is awfully abrupt from,1
10147,hulk hogan plays rip a professional wrestler who has a big heart but is pushed to the limit when his girlfriend joan severence is kidnapped by thugs who are forcing him to take on another wrestler tiny lister jr bottom of the barrel actioner is such a failure that even hogan looks ashamed to be in it and with the evidence portrayed he should be,0
13115,since i am a fan of natalie portman i had to see the movie i enjoyed every minute of it it plays out in a very sincere way throughout the whole movie at seemed as if natalie was the mother and susan was the mother susan s character kept making bad decisions and kept getting burned because of it i heard that there was supposed to be a love scene involving natalie and some guy he s in outside providence but natalie would only accept the script if that scene was removed and i think that is great i think that a love scene would have ruined the tone of the film natalie must have a knack for picking good movies to be in because i haven t seen her in a bad film yet so any movie that has natalie portman will no doubt be seen by me a good film 7 10,1
19702,i ve seen the previews everywhere before deciding to watch it and what do you know i actually liked it it has a new twist of the 18th century england although the music in the dance scene were obviously modernized and also the colors of liv tyler s clothers although it is pretty it fit quite perfectly if you just want a good time you should check this out very different from other 18th century detailed films,1
8924,it s painfully obvious that the people who made this movie have never seen such brilliant spoofs as the naked gun and hot shots this movie is terrible and so are the actors they wouldn t know acting even if it hit them in the face as i felt like doing while watching this total pile of rubbish the movie is stupid and has no humor in it what so ever i m sure that i could make a better movie with my friends to me it s amazing that a movie can fail this much not a single clever or funny line no trace of intelligence behind it it s a pathetic movie and i d like to meet the person who actually likes this movie yuck,0
15824,the killing yard is a great film although uneven at times morris chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and judicially jilted prison inmate and the presence of alan alda as his defense attorney is none other than genius the emotion and raw reality portrayed in this film s flashback scenes have the ability of putting viewers directly into the midst of the events being pictured i was not even born when the attica riot took place however through extensive research i find that the killing yard does the story all of it s fair justices i would definitely recommend this film for viewing by any educational or activist group as a much needed learning tool,1
6413,two l a cops track down a serial killer nicknamed the family man who has wiped out whole families and when one of the police officer s wife takes the deep six questions are raised and it turns out that a serial killer isn t responsible but rather mobsters the idea of seagal in a serial killer movie is an interesting concept indeed one could see seagal play a good serial killer however making him a cop who has a ridiculous penchant for prayer beads and razor sharp credit cards comes off more stupid than likably ridiculous also a running joke involves wayon s enjoyment of eating powdered deer penis and well this raunchy material is utterly out of place not to mention the beginning of a school being taken hostage due to a boy s breakup with his girlfriend after seagal neutralizes him the girlfriend tells the young lad that she loves him now there is a lesson to be learned from all of this if you want your girlfriend back taking the school hostage may get you back on her good side i myself would think flowers or the old fashioned phone call might work then again though i m old fashioned besides who am i to put a damper on somebody else s brilliant reconciliation plan out of 4 bad,0
10958,this is a pretty simplistic romance girl finds boy girl loves boy girl loses boy girl finds boy colleen moore is the outstanding ingredient in this recipe delivering a wonderfully varied dramatic romantic performance well deserving of an oscar nom equally fine are the aerial combat special effects moore plays a french girl whose mother has turned over their field to a british aerial squadron during wwi she is the daughter of the regiment loved as a little sister into this mix comes a fill in for a downed flyer gary cooper at first they hate each other then they love each other then the entire squadron is sent out on a suicide mission cooper returns but crashes in the village and a red cross unit removes him moore searches for him is told at a hospital he is dead then wanders the streets until he calls from a hospital window and they are reunited it s a nice little romance but hardly more than that recommended for fans of ms moore and mr cooper,0
260,if you are ever in the mood for a truly terrible film it would be hard to find something that could even compare to this i have spent a lot of time watching a lot of terrible movies just for the sheer joy i get from it and man this is one of the worst this movie was so bad i had to buy the third beastermaster online that one wasn t as bad which is amazing since it was straight to video this is one of those films that is hard to comprehend how it was made in the first place i mean someone had to actually have read the script or many scripts i m sure they made several drafts and said yeah that s it here s some money actually they probably just wanted to make a beastmaster 2 before they even had a script then went with whatever they had ack horrible so if you are a fan of really bad movies watch this one it is a true classic and film doesn t get much worse than this and if it does please let me know,0
12044,his has to surely be one of the worst gay themed films of all time who told any of the so called actors that they can act bad sound bad script gestures so overboard that they defy reality a nightclub scene with only one actor and dubbed crowd scenes after seeing other low budget films similarly made i was prepared for something innovative but not plain pathetic parents and friends really should not encourage anyone to make such tripe and the dvd no menu access its worse than a vhs tape once you start you have to watch the whole thing through luckily the fast forward button works with this film and dvd nothing else does,0
1306,besides the fact that this guy is a liar he is also a total idiot and a thief in the comedy community once when i attempted to watch this excuse for a television show i believe i actually threw up in my mouth a little i can t help but feel a little bit dumber every time is see one of his horrid commercials while i am enjoying great comedy central programs like reno 911 and american body shop it shows like this that make me worry about the continual existence of mankind it s hard to believe that even joe rogan can make someone look like an moron please begin praying now that comedy central will realize their mistake and end this show as soon as possible haven t we suffered enough,0
21783,i suspect there are several cuts of this doco doing the rounds the copy i saw focused heavily on joe s erotic films and referred to his horror output in passing there are numerous x rated films presented in their x rated glory and emmanuelle in america s legendary snuff footage the breasts being cut off is given generous screen time the interviews with the highly likable joe are informative and candid he is an unassuming articulate gent and discusses his interest in shocking audiences why he wanted to mix erotica with horror and how he may have been responsible for one of his performers turning gay his friendship and working relationship with indonesian beauty laura gemser is touched on as is his indifferent attitude to shooting hardcore joe d amato personifies an incredible period in continental cinema that has now passed it is great to see a documentary dedicated to him and his fine unique work rip joe,1
22671,when one watches the animated superman shorts of the 1940s the similarity of the plots can become a bit boring the adversary is most often a mad scientist in a hidden headquarter threatening metropolis with some evil invention death rays mechanical monsters electric earthquake magnetic telescope what have you this one is refreshingly different the bad ones drive around in a car shooting and bombing but the center of action is the gold train on which lois lane travels as the only press reporter it seems train movies have their own typical ingredients from the 1903 great train robbery on and quite some are featured here decoupling cars in motion running on the roofs taking the steam locomotive from the tender in the back fighting with the engineer a switch turned to deroute the train on a side track the fall of people or the whole train from a high bridge it s all in the few minutes of this lovely piece but it wouldn t be a superman film if he didn t do some incredible feats involving balancing and high precision placement to ultimately win the day if you re a fan of train movies don t miss this it s in the public domain and can be legally downloaded from archive org,1
6484,my wife and i watched this abortion from its beginning i hated it immediately but my wife became hooked on it for a couple of years for me it just got worse and worse and the characters were all without question dreary and depressing without any redeeming features my wife then grew tired of it and we stopped watching altogether occasionally i catch a clip of it or pass through it when channel surfing there is always someone yelling at someone else or doing something dreadful there never seems to be any lighter moments or happiness of any kind that was always my main gripe with it when we first watched it no humour the writers seem to have no idea about drama they seem to think conflict is drama and of course that is only one element of it light and shade is sorely needed and actors who can bring something to it i am sure the actors in eastenders are competent but they have nothing to work with it must be the most depressing acting job in showbiz i fail to understand why the british public watch it and love it what on earth does it say about our psyche i have heard it said that it is just like real life its nothing like my life or anyone s life i know otherwise we would be flinging ourselves from high buildings or under public transport the themes it tackles are far from family viewing but still are shown pre watershed i love series like breaking bad or the wire but i would not expect to see them at 7 30 or 8 00 in the evening the programme is trash writ large and should be avoided at all cost,0
5675,you know that this film is in serious trouble when the best acting job is the support role played by arnold schwarzenegger while this was still relatively early in his career and he wasn t the best actor compared to brigitte nielsen he s sir john gielgud in fact this film proves that the only reason she got much of any attention were her boobs and because she was involved with the incredibly self destructive football player mark gastineau so instead of this being her break out film this and a beverly hills cop movie mark about as high as she went in her one note career it was obvious too that the financing wizards gave up on this movie as well because the supporting cast aside from arnold is pretty lame and the script is dull dull dull fans looking for another conan movie would no doubt be very disappointed in this slow and uninvolving film,0
19580,this film is so wonderful it captures the gaming life i laughed so hard while watching this the movie is about a gaming group that have a hard time with a campaign that their dungeon master came up with the movie switches from the real world and the gaming world as they play the campaign it shows them in the gaming world as their character and then switches back to the real world when they are not playing the campaign is the basis for a module that the dungeon master lodge is writing the problem is lodge can t finish his module because the characters can t finish the campaign they are more for killing and looting instead of role playing lodge wants them to role play through the campaign something they have never done before they decide to bring in some extra help so they bring a wait for it girl in to play lodge also makes a npc a non player character a paladin who can not witness or do wrong to play the film is how they do all this and more i don t want to spoil any of the film so i won t say any more this movie may not be a big budget film the acting may not be oscar worthy but if you are into gaming or into dungeons and dragons then definitely watch it they had a lot of fun making this film and it shows i am not going to bash on it for any movie problems such as continuity or any thing it was a low budget film that is just fun there is some slap stick comedy which i enjoy and some damn good writing in my opinion so if you want a fun film try it,1
13742,thank god for this movie it s a document of talent that three decades later seems even more unique and rare in retrospect the music is just extraordinary packed with so much talent in writing performance arrangement and production that it s absolutely infectious the lyrics and vocal arrangements are incredible the performances by under appreciated talents like nell carter and ren woods uplift my spirit every time i hear them while the film may be different from the stage version i prefer the soundtrack to the cast album which i find truly grating and under developed here the arrangements are filled out and expanded into dynamic pieces that couldn t have been produced in a stage setting but the music isn t the only thing extraordinary about this movie the juxtaposition of almost hyper realist dialog scenes reminds me of altman films intercut with exuberant musical and dance numbers really works all the talent in this movie directing writing photography editing music choreography casting acting costuming art direction merge perfectly into one of the best musical films i ve seen i think it s amazing how much we know about the characters in hair based on very little information or plot they re not drawn as caricatures but as realistic and very human people we see little glimpses of where they come from but the portrait is completed by vignettes that draw the characters to the surface through accomplished acting directing and editing there s an undercurrent theme of the misogyny of berger and hud which colors their characters by exposing their reckless macho hippie ideology the scene of berger s home life reveals important details about his psychology and the brief glimpse of claude s home tells us volumes about his background through the simple realistic and genuine interaction between claude and presumably his father i love the fashion in this movie it defiantly mixes sixties ideas with very seventies looks one does have to overlook treat williams hair extensions it s a document of how chic much of the late seventies was contrary to the conventional wisdom that the era was all about bad taste claude s beige knitted tie was a hot trend of 1979 and the hair and clothing of the singers and dancers particularly those in white during the central park scene mixes up the decades in a way that suggests the timelessness of the musical s themes these elements merge with twyla tharpe s extraordinary state of the art choreography in a way that enhances the artistry of both hair isn t a film that rewards cynicism if you come to it with expectations then you re most likely going to be held captive by artists who aren t bound by your rules for me it opened my eyes and ears and spirit to an insightful and passionate musical dialog about war friendship and family that transcends its time and is still meaningful and relevant to me to this day,1
21889,since others have complained about putting sherlock holmes into a contemporary setting i won t do that basil rathbone could have fit in in any era with that voice that savoir faire this is a nicely put together mystery based loosely on the dancing men one of the best of conan doyle s stories instead of the original plot it makes the men part of a nazi plot holmes becomes a spokesman for the british war effort his adversary is moriarity who seems to die frequently enough to rival the central figure in the friday 13th films he is certainly creative but the rathbone holmes is unflappable watson is just along for the ride in this one he isn t given much stupidity to spout in this film and that s a real plus the plot is complex enough to keep ones interest there is a concluding speech that is almost a parody of itself but then i can t be critical of a time and nation that was under great duress if they needed to call in holmes so be it,1
17713,i laughed out loud several times during this film though give it a cursory glance and you would think it was something else altogether i adore the pace and the way it slowly burns into you as you are presented these gobsmackingly beautiful tableaux andersson gives us something else here shows us something i had not seen since his last film he is compositionally exceptional and via his method of fixing the camera and allowing action to take place before us he opens the door on humanity and we peer into a place that reflects our own lives our little lives it is powerful stuff it is the simplicity with which he allows the events to take place that creates the opposite feeling of complexity everything in front of the camera is anything but simple andersson s attention to detail is extraordinary i believe most scenes if not all are sets built from scratch according to his designs i cannot recommend this film highly enough for me it took me to a place and i came out of it having witnessed a world frayed and beautiful starched and pained barren and splendid at once alien and familiar this film is brilliant and life affirming i know because i came out smiling feeling wonderful it has taken him seven years to make this if he only made this one film he would still be up there with the greats,1
4931,creakiness and atmosphere this film has but so unfortunately does the print i just viewed raymond massey provides a laid back sherlock holmes almost comically so in early scenes in his bathrobe which he trades in for a laborer s garb to investigate the creepy mansion of dr rylott lyn harding what wasn t clear to me was why rylott would have wanted his stepdaughters dead if as in the case of helen angela baddeley he didn t want her to run off to get married he would have accomplished the same thing by having her dispatched other curiosities abound as well after setting an early wedding date with helen the fianc e is no longer heard from for the rest of the picture the presence of a band of gypsies at the time of violet stoner s death provides merely a diversion and what could have been an interesting murder tool a poisonous snake is diluted by the fact that it was not a cobra the musical renderings of the indian man servant notwithstanding athole stewart competently portrays holmes aide dr watson though he takes some getting used to if nigel bruce is more your cup of tea as rylott lyn harding is sufficiently menacing a trait that would be put to good use as holmes nemesis professor moriarty in two later films 1935 s the triumph of sherlock holmes and 1937 s murder at the baskervilles with repeated choppiness and an unsteady camera it s surprising that the story line isn t more disrupted than it is it s integrity is generally maintained even if one stretches a bit to fill in the gaps i guess that would be my main complaint with the film as mentally bridging some of the jump cuts in the picture proved to be a real pain in the asp,0
19322,walter matthau is best remembered for the long series of comedies he did with his equal comedy partner jack lemmon from the fortune cookie to the odd couple ii but people tend to forget that in the late 1970s he appeared with another partner in two films a female partner this was glenda jackson the english double oscar winner who demonstrated her comic abilities against matthau s first in house calls and then in hopscotch matthau s role was slightly larger in both films because his characters were more central to the plots but the chemistry between them was quite good if you ever want to see two pros demonstrating how sexual intercourse can be crazily funny watch walter and glenda as dr charley nicholson and ann atkinson experimenting to see if two people could have sex on a bed under the old movie code rule of the two parties each having one leg on the floor never has sex been looked at from such a clinical and mechanical point of view matthau s charlie has just been widowed before the film began he has only had one woman in his life his wife so now he s the eligible bachelor he also is the leading surgeon in the hospital he works out of but the chief surgeon is dr amos weatherby art carney carney is apparently senile there are moments later in the film that show he turns his senility on and off see the scene where he rams richard benjamin s car amos is up for re election charlie is his closest competitor for the post if he wants it however amos manages to convince charlie to let him keep the job for reasons of self esteem one day charlie notices ann in the hospital she has had a slight accident and is resting in bed but amos has put her into a cage like apparatus which charlie remarks has not been used since about 1920 he gets her out of the device and soon is romancing her she joins the staff of the hospital but she is critical of charlie s willingness to cater to amos and she is critical of certain selfish tendencies she sees among the doctors in the hospital amos bungling causes the death of a wealthy patron of the hospital lloyd gough who owned a baseball team his greatest innovation being separate admission costs for double headers amos tries to calm down the young widow of the team owner delivering the eulogy at the burial service the line in the summary above is the peroration line of the eulogy however she is still determined to sue her lawyer thayer david says the hospital is the most incompetent he s ever seen so amos suggests that charlie romance the widow to satisfy her from that expensive lawsuit but how will ann react to this the film is quite amusing and was so successful that besides causing a sequel for jackson and matthau it led to a television series as well,1
3374,first off just to say i didn t get the edition i thought i would i chose the italian version over the r2 but what actually arrived was a uk release from 1998 claiming to be a special edition i never knew there was a uk dvd release but the promised biogs were not actually on the disc just a couple of duff trailers anyway as to the film itself just as i was recovering from night train murders my second genital mutilation thriller turns up in the same month this time in an italian uk nubile schoolgirls are being offed and teacher fabio testi unhappily married but nailing one of his students becomes the main suspect joachim fuchsberger is the detective on the case sorry to say i was less than entranced it was watchable but more than equally miss able and aside from the aforementioned gruesome nature of the crime the surprise killing of cristina galbo which was actually spoilt by the dvd cover telling me about it grrrrrr and a surprise twist that cast the victims in a new light i thought this was very routine itwont put me off the two sequels though with karin hannibal brooks baal and camille i spit on your grave keaton,0
22367,the inherent problem with any staging of the merchant of venice has never been the pseudo controversial anti semitism but the fact that there are two story lines wildly different in both tone and content a frothy romantic comedy and a searing tragedy while mixing genres was all the rage in the sixteenth century and mocked by shakespeare in hamlet it rarely fails to grate with modern audiences as a result most directors are forced to place an emphasis on one storyline at the expense of the other and it is no surprise that the decision falls in the favour of shylock like so many of shakespeare s great tragic heroes shylock continues to fascinate after 400 years because he is such a difficult and complex character pitiful proud angry vengeful weak arrogant his behaviour defies simply analysis and continues to be argued over he is flawed not because he is a jew but because he is human rarely do modern screenwriters imbue their creations with such richly textured contradictions and it is to everyone s benefit that we have shakespeare to draw on for inspiration shakespearean language is wild and rambling saturated in multiple meanings word play and metaphor to be understood it must be wrangled and tamed by an actor with the strength and knowledge to do so when an actor fails the words pour forth in a torrent of incomprehensible words but when he succeeds the english language springs to life with an immediacy and vibrancy that takes your breath away al pacino is one such actor and here displays an incredible level of clarity and control that were there any justice would sweep every award in the offering he meets the challenge of presenting shylock head on and delivers an extraordinarily subtle and nuanced performance it would be a crime if we never got the opportunity to see what he does with king lear the supporting cast is noteworthy jeremy irons gives an original take on the familiar antonio presenting an older quieter figure that displays the unsavoury contradictions between medieval chivalry and ugly prejudice of the time joseph fiennes is a revelation as he matures beyond superficial eye candy to actually inhabit a character for once lynn collins is the only disappointment many of shakespeare s women are underwritten and require an actor to really work hard to bring them to life and collins gwyneth paltrow impersonation seems a little flat and unsuited to the darker tone that radford is aiming for the design team must be acknowledged for creating a unique and thoroughly believable vision of late renaissance venice the city has not looked this ominous since don t look now taking full advantage of extant locations and natural light the film has an appearance of authenticity that is greatly enhanced by the dark and timeworn costume design all again are worthy of award recognition the financial backers of films such as this must be commended with a budget of 30 million they must go into such a venture in the full and certain knowledge that they will never make a profit and yet they invest nonetheless we can all be grateful for it as the result is a remarkable adaptation that is sure to be a benchmark for many years to come,1
16004,i saw the messiah the first killings and i thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes i have seen ever it was one of those programmes that you think that oh no i cannot watch the rest of this but you feel compelled to watch it just to see who done it jamie draven was an absolutely amazing actor in it to be able to switch between two totally totally different characters one of which is the evil nasty person that did it and the other person who is jez clifton the cop to be able to do that well i certainly wouldn t be able to do it well not without cracking anyway i really do love and care for jamie draven with all of my heart and i always will until the end of time i think that jamie is the sweetest cutest sexiest guy in the world i absolutely love jamie in ultimate force also because he looks god damn sexy in the blacks that he wore i love jamie love paula draven x,1
11569,komodo vs cobra is not going to set the world on fire it s not a hallmark of cinema history what it is is a group of underfunded filmmakers trying to make another movie make another paycheck and continue to support themselves and their families as such i give these efforts a lot of slack i mean come on it has to be hard to be a russian special effects technician not a lot of big budget films getting made there but they are a dedicated bunch and more than willing to throw their all into whatever lame american monster flick needs affordable sfx and i get a kick out of looking for the same locations appear time and again in these flicks if for some reason you find yourself watching this again look at the sequence where pare and company are walking through a jungle look at their feet and you ll see paved walkways and if you happen to still have a copy of ai assault shown a week or two earlier also on scifi you ll see the folks in there tramping through the same ersatz jungle come to think of it i think the helicopters land in the same clearing in both flicks i can admire the thriftiness of these films every dollar really does show up on the screen too bad there just aren t enough dollars,0
11093,this movie was awful plain and simple it will probably be revered by those who only see films and not movies and will therefore feel sorry for me for having such a limited understanding of the theatrical brilliance of this film but i am secure enough in my intellect to say that this boring self aggrandizing and painfully drawn out movie was a waste of two hours and nine dollars i was suckered into seeing this by the inexplicable good reviews it had been receiving and came out of the theater thinking that those reviews had to have been written by over excited film students and the aforementioned group of individuals who shun regular movies perhaps for fear that they may actually enjoy one someday the storyline is quite a promising one a man is imprisoned for 15 years never knowing his captor nor his crime he is then abruptly released and given just five days to discover the identity and reason of the man who imprisoned him however the great concept soon disintegrates into a pathetic joke as oh dae su runs around beating people up trying to have sex with a young girl who is attempting to use the toilet and eating a live writhing squid presumably for dramatic effect as there is absolutely no other reason for it all the while he is trying to figure out this horrible thing he did to earn himself fifteen years in jail and when he finally finds out it is both ridiculous and a major letdown his nemesis a man who supposedly went to school with him when he was a young man looks like a banana republic model twenty years younger than him hey i know prison has been hard on oh dae su but is it too much to ask to find an actor that looks a bit closer to his age of all the things wrong with this movie this one seems like the easiest one to fix and the big secret the one that kept me in my seat for 90 minutes when i could have been out doing something productive is some joke of a plot line involving incest and a rumor started in high school come on throw us a bone here was that really the best they could do i sat through stupid dialogue over acting gloomy sets and gratuitous violence for this by the way i m not at all against violence in a film if it seems to fit the story but in this case it seems i was forced to watch our hero knock out someone s front teeth and cut off his own tongue with a pair of scissors in order to distract me from figuring out i was wasting my afternoon watching a pretentious piece of garbage take my advice do something else with your time and money or take your nine dollars and go see a lowly movie one that you might actually enjoy,0
10174,my wife spotted this film on the aisle at a local video store from the cover it looked like a science fiction film but upon turning it over my wife saw rebecca st james was in the film realized it was a christian movie and suggested we watch it we are conservative evangelicals but we also know that christian films have a poor reputation in the mainstream nevertheless we decided to give it a screening to be fair there were a few things i liked about the film the musical score much of which was orchestrated was quite good the cinematography was also pretty good considering it was a lower budget movie unfortunately any virtue in this film s production work was lost on a regrettable script the film begins with an interesting premise ufo abductions but by midway through the feature the storyline veers wildly into an evangelistic crusade spearheaded by the movie s two main characters which then veers wildly into a treatise on the rapture at least the frank peretti inspired the visitation which was itself a deeply flawed film had an endgame that tied together the movie s premise unidentified ends nowhere even close to where it started which is a huge letdown as for the acting the supporting acting ranges from decent to awful rebecca st james plays a bit part and is passable for their part a few of the main characters are manned capably enough sadly their talents are wasted on characters so one dimensional in their personalities so as to be unbelievable the protagonists are anything but you know it s bad when two christian viewers find the most vocal christian character in the film to be the most annoying a final note on the evangelistic tone of this movie which will be of more interest to christian than non christian readers in a word it is embarrassing other christian films like carmen s the champion and peretti s the hangman s curse have managed to communicate a genuinely uncompromising portrait of the christian faith without sounding preachy or oppressive this film by contrast is a sledgehammer that feels so heavy handed and lacking in tact that a non christian would have a hard time taking it seriously i do believe that the filmmaker s heart is in the right place and i applaud efforts to create good christian film unfortunately this is not one of them if your church is looking for a screening of a good christian film consider mercy streets the aforementioned the champion or if you re pentecostal robert duvall s provocative the apostle as for unidentified rent it if you must but screen it before you show it to a non christian or a larger audience,0
2838,i m thinking of some things for this movie first really is a very bad movie this is really superbad the film looked very promising in the trailers but fell flat maybe the original idea was good but between a bad script and bad acting the movie became boring and empty my advise is don t waste 2 hours of your precious time you have been warned this is the first movie i rated 1 star at imdb com second none of the characters are likable you really don t care what happened to them third the villain is very easy to identify the grandson kills his father sodomizes the friend s son get the maid pregnant smothers his grandfather like jt says if you like evil with no retribution this is your movie nothing more to say,0
18547,i was first introduced to john waters films by seeing female trouble on ifc i was disgusted but for some sick reason i enjoyed it then i picked up the pink flamingos dvd in the john waters boxed set the movie is about babs johnson the filthiest person alive who lives in a trailer in maryland with her obese egg obsessed mother and her deranged son crackers in the movie you will see such sick sights as sex with chickens drag queens people eating feces torture and all other sorts of random humiliation the film has a soundtrack from 60 s rock and roll artists the only problem is that some parts of the film seem to drag on and can get a little boring i found female trouble a little more fun rated nc 17 for explicit sex violence and disturbing images enjoy,1
15626,saw this last night at the 7th annual nyc home film festival a rather tumultuous venue that quieted down for this sweet and touching two woman film the relationship between the two one older and blind the other a twenty something who helps her with her mail is established deftly and its depth is readily apparent there are no car chases explosions or mind boggling special effects just the sometimes difficult but rewarding task of humans reaching out toward each other to help and be helped see if it you can,1
19060,anyone looking to learn more about the development of skateboarding should find dogtown and z boys adequate research material this is not to be confused with lords of dogtown that sorry hollywood attempt to cash in on the success of the original dogtown revival directed by stacey peralta a former z boys himself as well as pro skater and mastermind behind the 80s bones brigade and co written with skateboarding photojournalist craig stecyk this documentary traces how a group of surfing kids from southern california s mean streets known as dogtown who formed the z boys skateboard team actually there was one girl peggy oki revolutionized skateboarding the film contains interviews from nearly all of the z boys chris cahill s whereabouts are unknown with the most noteable being bad ass tony alva and the youngest jay adams who s talents along with perlata seemed to transcend the rest of the teams there are interviews of the team s and the dogtown shop founders surfboard designer jeff ho skip engbloom and craig stecyk there are also interviews of folks like tony hawk obviously ian mckaye fugazi and henry rollins who were young kids in the 70s when dogtown was making it s influence on skateboarding skateboarding was a whole other context in previous years as the documentary explains it really shows you not only who the dogtown team was and how they formed but why their style changed not only skateboarding tricks pool skating became immensley popular and thus gave way to vert skating but also facilitated the sport though not into the extreme commercialism it is today as more than just the fleeting fad it had been earlier as these surfing kids who s waves ran out in the early morning needed ways to spend their time and eventually got into skateboarding the days of russ howell and alan gelfand were long over as the dogtown at least through the publicity of their skate team paved the way for the new generation of skaters because dogtown got all the attention they were able to push skating to the next step it s a great documentary in the way that it is put together though stacey peralta always knew how to do this even when producing the bones brigade mini movies skate demos like ban this and search for animal chin narrated by sean penn the film is accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack contains lots of terrific archive footage and lots of interview to give you a genuine feel of who the z boys were and how they made their mark on skateboarding,1
11443,i was looking forward to this flick being an old robert e howard fan mainly from a conan stand point i was not expecting a great deal and thought they could not mess it up too much oh dear how wrong was i the main flaw was it was fairly dull it needed to zip along with a nice helping of supernatural goings on sword fights and the like you got some gore but everything else was just pretty life less the middle section just seemed to involve 40 minutes in a muddy forest with slow plodding horse drawn carts and even slower dialogue and character development on the plus side costumes and effects were fine but not enough to keep your interest i think it would have been better to tone down the gore up the tempo and go for a 12a rating as a ten year old boy i may have liked this movie probably about the age i was first reading the conan stories funny enough perhaps that says a lot about my anticipation of the film or go really art house with tone direction etc but that s fairly high risk as far as box office is concerned oh well perhaps the next conan movie will make up for it,0
12716,bloody birthday plays on the assumed innocence of children and shows them as bloodthirsty monsters steven andy freeman curtis billy jayne credited as billy jacoby and debbie elizabeth hoy were all born on the same day during an eclipse besides sharing a birthday they also share a love of murder and they re not picky about who they kill either young billy elizabeth and andy play the parts of these emotionless monsters quite well but they know when to put on the charm too but they can t go on fooling everyone this is an overall good horror flick its not too unrealistic there are a few good moments of suspense and the kids portrayed the roles well the grown ups are pretty hammy though i d say its well worth seeing i own a copy myself,1
12476,ever once in a while i run into a movie that is so embarrassingly bad i wonder why movies exist this is one of them this is a terrible attempt to parody the godfather with annoying cartoon sounds and bad dialogue eddie deezen is just plain annoying as tony an annoying twit who upon his father don william hickey s request takes over the family business tony as i said is an annoying little twit this makes the whole movie a complete mess the movie is terribly daffy it s too cartoonish the main point i m trying to make is that you can t make a parody of an acclaimed drama like the godfather with so much cartoonishness it doesn t work that way believe it or not you have to take a parody of a dramatic movie seriously if you don t take it seriously it will feel too much like a parody the thing about doing a parody is that you can t seem too much like you re doing a parody you have to make it seem like you re taking the movie at least a little bit seriously it also feels like they re just mocking woody allen and that s what makes this movie absolutely terrible,0
18273,what can one say about any wilder film other than they are the most human and real stories about people and what drives them bugs them haunts them billy created pictures like paintings that stand forever reflecting the human condition he paints the good and the bad in all of us he also paints with love i can t imagine anyone having a list of greatest films without a wilder film on it they will last because they are true i first saw this movie on tv in the 60s when i was a kid and i had to leave the room because i felt tears welling up in me and was embarrassed now i m an old man and i still feel the tears welling but don t leave the room i knew these people and loved them and grew up around them billy preserved them in this film and not in a greatest generation way but in a most realistic way that preserved the power of the human spirit,1
11978,this an extremely horrible movie and if your thinking you ve seen another horrible movie exactly like this one before you probably have you probably saw scarecrow 2 made in 2003 yes thats what i said brian the director stole the movie idea and not only did he steal it he actually might have been able to make it worse i bet the even the actors were scared to tell people they were actually in the movie also i have to mention that the director was trying to make up for the cheesiness by showing as much tits as possible also the kissing scenes were put together like a porn movie in fact that is probably all that the director has ever seen and tried to put together a decent movie which will never work,0
1931,there is a reason to call this a teen flick out of 100 possible points i would put it somewhere in the teens it is predictable the acting is horrible especially the minor roles and above all else it is super predictable the ending is so hokey that i should have left early and maybe it would have passed by the way could you call the male lead a pervert i bet if it really happened someone in my school district would have said so finally in the school i grew up in even though the average class had over 1000 students we could have picked out a chump like josie as being a fraud and we would have singled her out of the crowd my final word is save your time when it comes on tv watch something better like the stock quotes,0
19661,i rarely even bother to watch comedic movies or television these days they re insipid vulgar and most importantly not funny this one could be seen as a refreshing blast from the past it s worth watching and i don t believe it would be dated in any significant way classic humor is classic humor and good writing is good writing regardless of the era in which created i would love to see this film again it came to mind after having seen the somewhat similar summer school on television recently like that slightly newer film meatballs is funny without being cruel overly sexual or indulging in bathroom humor the key of course is how the adult character makes such a difference in the life of the teen character maybe even a virtually life saving change and how they both grow up in the space of a summer,1
784,here in australia nights in rodanthe is being promoted in the same class as the notebook quite frankly what a lot of rot this film is a like a recipe on paper we have all the right ingredients richard gere normally perfect in this genre diane lane an old favourite from under tuscan sun and unfaithful ocean side location solitude and yet the movie sucks at the session we went to yesterday afternoon a women next to my wife fell asleep and half way through the movie got up and left the main problem is there is no build up or credibility to the relationship in the first place and perhaps there are too many long faces and downbeat if you like histories that gere and lane s characters bring to the movie there s hours of those balanced out with perhaps 5 minutes of what we can to see romance there s no warmth from gere s character lane looks dreadful at the start of the movie and all washed out so as the viewer we cannot really connect to the characters others here say the book is great well be it the screenplay direction or production someone here has made a real mess of this movie it s like the scenes and the buildup are a deck of cards except instead of being in the correct order they ve just been thrown together all over the place very disappointing save your money for when it hits the video shops and even then wait for a good deal when it goes to the weekly rate,0
7418,i knew that i was not about to see a quality film when this title was included in a b grade video night at a friends place despite the warnings i was still surprised at just how bad this film was it was fortunate that there were a lot of us there to share the pain with each other the film attempts to tell the story of a dark future one in which hawk a mad max type of character heads off to rescue a damsel in distress in reality the plot is a thinly disguised excuse for the producers to promote their own philosophies on life watch the end credits and the these people are not real disclaimer at the end for a real laugh the movie is frequently lacking direction and fails to develop its characters to any degree whatsoever what s even worse though is the editing of this film the film repeats scenes often 10 to 20 seconds long up to 4 or 5 times in a row i think that this was an attempt to emulate things like jean claude van damme fight sequences but if it is it fails utterly the film would probably be about 1 3 of its length if we weren t forced to watch the main character move his head in front of the setting sun half a dozen times yes that s all that happens in that repeated scene i give this movie my worst film i ve ever seen award i doubt that it will be topped any time soon,0
19963,this is one of the greatest films ever made brilliant acting by george c scott and diane riggs this movie is both disturbing and extremely deep don t be fooled into believing this is just a comedy it is a brilliant satire about the medical profession it is not a pretty picture healthy patients are killed by incompetent surgeons who spend all their time making money outside the hospital and yet you really believe that this is a hospital the producers were very careful to include real medical terminology and real medical cases this movie really reveals how difficult in is to run a hospital and how badly things already were in 1971 i loved this movie p s i noticed that the incompetent wheeler dealer surgeon played the head of the firm in la law the young doctor played in lou grant i also noticed that the registration nurse has appeared since in becker and other shows,1
8967,this is one of the few movies maybe the only that truly haunted me for years it was the first i had ever seen people tortured so much that blood was flowing of their mouths from gritting their teeth and screaming etc it was brutal the worst thing i had ever seen on film dr clement molloch played by joseph mayer is still one of the most evil characters i ve ever seen on film and i ve viewed thousands he was so sadistic that i would never watch this movie again nor would i recommend it he makes hannibal lecter look like mr rogers if seeing people tortured is not your idea of fun then stay away from this film i know there are a lot of sick people out there many of them professional film critics who probably enjoyed this sordid sick story it s a b movie anyway with stupid dialog and some wooden acting by charles bronson this is not one of his better efforts even if it was there so many horrendous scenes in here you wouldn t want to watch trust me on this one,0
10019,to summarize my group of friends and i spent about 45 minutes outside the theater sharing our favorites gaffes plot inconsistencies untied loose ends and other ridiculous aspects of this movie i found the story trite to the point of inconsequential and the plot lines as underdeveloped as the dino embryos still locked in the shaving cream canister from jurassic park 1 the editing was poor and none of the characters engendered any sort of sympathy or feeling in short this movie lacked any of the suspense and thrill that the first movie provided from a story standpointeven the new dinosaurs were few and far between although i really enjoyed the pterodactyls we got several brief shots of the new species and only 2 really were involved in the action as a scientist and former childhood paleontologist the lack of any real scientific content not that it had to be realistic but logically formed i e how they built the dinos in 1 and malcom s chaos ramblings was disappointing as well in short the movie seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to trot dinos back on the scene to make some money i hope that movie goers don t fall for this trap again although i did apparently,0
14917,i really enjoyed this movie i have probably watched it 2 dozen times or more and still enjoy it being an old navy guy im still stirred by the rousing rendition of anchors away i also love the mchales navy pirate atmosphere i could have done without the female dive officer but im just old fashioned i guess she was still good to look at lol espesially after the crew got done with her laundry the cook sonarman and electrician made the movie loved the salty old engineer and his first class po too and grammer actually did a very commendable job of being a misfit officer i loved the driving scene as they passed the golf course on the way into port lol pure navy and i swear i had an xo that was just like that little weasel im am so glad this is out on dvd about bloody time 0,1
4737,funny thing charlie sheen donald sutherland sam waterston and stephen lang have all had incredible performances who can forget sheen as the callow naif in wall street or sutherland as the the cynical korean war surgeon in mash waterston and lang have both also had successful tv and film careers law and order killing fields de niro s tribeca etc so what in the world would any of these fine actors be doing in a stink bomb like this shadow conspiracy s plot of a washington coup d etat is not really that bad unoriginal maybe but not that bad sure it s been done seven days in may a fine film but with a little tweaking it could still have been entertaining shadow conspiracy s main problem is in the execution early in the film sheen political strategist extreme ridiculously and implausibly resolves a potential public relations gaffe by blackmailing a congressman later gunplay with lang s mute hitman tearing up half of what is supposed to be georgetown is explained on the news as gang wars has anyone remotely associated with this film ever lived a day in washington sheen is about 20 years too young way way too young to be so senior in a white house administration sheen s response to avert a political crisis is so ladened with false machismo he looks as though he attended the david hasselhoff school of acting and when was the last time gang wars spread to georgetown we re talking about a section of washington where citizens voted against having a metro stop so that they could maintain their exclusivity i agree with another reviewer that this film would have been unbearable without the fast forward button i taped it off hbo a year ago and then took 3 separate viewings to plod through it in summary don t buy this film don t even rent this film if you see it at blockbuster run away as fast as you can,0
9760,hellboy revolves around classic comic book action superhero genre story lines essentially hellboy is a kind of demon who has found his way on earth he is brought up from a child by a priest and within a government society and has chosen to protect the people of earth from the supernatural rather then be a menace the normal career route for a demon the set up of the story involves creative uses of history combining nazi experiments with the occult it s preposterous but so is the whole idea of a demon roaming the streets i find the explanations of the characters who they are and how they came to be very well handled the sequences are to the point and very entertaining in fact the opening is the best part of the film therein lays the problem essentially del toro who both writes and directs this piece bottles it the film is absent of all tension or any major conflict hellboy is essentially established as invincible within the first act and so the rest of the film comprises of scenes in which any conflict is automatically rather crass because we know inevitably hellboy will be ok and the bad guy will die i hear you cry that this is the case for any action hero film well yes it is but once we are drawn into a well made action film we can t help but feel the hero may die die hard works because john mclane looks likely to die at all parts he escapes death by the slimmest of margins the stakes are raised as his wife is also in danger etc etc terminator and terminator two work because in both cases the villain is far superior than the hero the threat and tension is constant some of the other major weaknesses are del toro is also guilty of employing deus ex machina characters generally disappear and reappear as their skills are needed within the story the villain is featured in maybe three scenes he has no motives turns up unexpectedly and inexplicably in the one scene hellboy looks to be up against a real threat groups of monsters a character unleashes her abilities the screen fades to white and inexplicably the monsters are dead but everybody else lives a minor character established in an irritating and undeveloped love story becomes the key to the conclusion of the film her character is so thin the relationship so undeveloped it is clear she is nothing more than a prop of sorts to push the plot along and to make it all make sense i don t want to ruin the ending of the film but essentially a character that is dead is miraculously and unbelievably brought back to life the film suffers from poor dialogue and one liners that just aren t smart or funny after a while it all starts to grate what s more del toro blows the action scenes with some uninspired visuals and whoever made the creative decision to make hellboy s primary weapon a gun instead of his clunking arm should be fired essentially the use of the gun weakens the concept of the film degrading the fights to nothing more than a one sided shoot out the few positives include the cinematography is very good at all times a sense of mood is established by the dark lighting and the darker colour palette as well as the use of interesting locations yet perhaps it is all a bit samey as well the use of cgi and fx is well done never do we get an over load when effects are used they are used well and the sense of realism is kept rather similar to how nolan used fx in batman i much prefer this method to the overtop effects we often see all in all this is a pretty poor film the real shame is that despite not reading the comics i found the film wasted a lot of potential hellboy as a character has a lot of instantly apparent fascinating dimensions which are completely unexplored the film has watch ability in the sense that if it comes on tv and nothing else is on it might be worth a viewing but in any other situation i wouldn t bother with it,0
4780,new orleans is nothing like how it is portrayed in thisdebacle of a film quaid s attempt at speaking with a cajunaccent by the way hardly anyone speaks that way in neworleans is terrible plot elementary and mindless thispicture refers to itself as a mystery but a mystery involves agradual process whereby a viewer is given clues and twists throughout a film there s none of that here bigeasy tries to get by on trite new orleans stereotypes don t be fooled the real big easy is nothing like the townthat quaid barkin bumble their way through,0
12481,larry clark is not renowned for his talents as a writer or a director but he has made some undeniably important films kids bully and to a lesser extent ken park all achieve their intended purpose shock revulsion and even disgust these films are uncompromising in their content and use their controversial nature to expose very serious problems in modern youth kids exposed us to the proliferation of a i d s and sexual promiscuity among the young bully touched upon similar issues ken park dealt somewhat ham handedly with sexual abuse and suburban ennui irrefutably all of these films exposed something horrifying and left a bad taste in your mouth wassup rockers is about a group of poor hispanic skateboarders from south central las angeles who go to arbitrarily go to beverly hills to skate that s it wassup rockers is nothing it has no substance it has an essentially nonexistent narrative and like kids it features a cast of first time actors who were drawn out of the films setting however unlike kids none of them have any semblance of talent there is better acting in porn this film features without a doubt the most terrible performances i ve ever seen in a feature film one can respect larry clark to exposing these young men to the film making process but these kids are absolutely cringe worthy folks might i add that apparently these gents also produced the soundtrack which features some of the most dismally inept garage punk you ll ever hear my advice is to pop a couple of migraine pills before you enter the theater or you ll regret it afterward but then again it s not like they had much of a script to work with every line that is uttered is a contrived pathetically delivered and irritating beyond all measure the story itself is ludicrous it starts out reasonably enough but soon slips quite unexpectedly into sheer absurdity this begins of course with a capricious sexcapade with a pair of rich white girls followed by a series of clich d national lampoonish encounters characters being killed off for no reason and finally resulting in a ridiculous anti climax shots go on much longer than they need to be prepared to watch people fall of skateboards for about fifteen minutes straight overlong lingering shots of characters doing nothing or skateboarding down streets but then again with the script at a scant 32 pages they need as much useless filler as possible perhaps wassup rockers would have worked better as a short film anyways i could go on like this this is the worst film larry clark has made yet for those of you who are interested in seeing a clark movie if only for his shocking pederast antics look elsewhere this is by far the tamest film he s made yet and it s also the worst it s flat out horrible like uwe boll horrible definitely the worst one i saw at the festival 1 10,0
13641,i can t remember the series i believe it may have been american masters but it was broadcast on pbs around 1980 most people have some knowledge of the development of the a bomb and those that have little or none probably think it is a pretty dry subject anyone who has viewed this 7 part series does not feel that way you get to know the turmoil in oppenhemiers mind and how the development changed his life forever you understand the tragic figure he became and why with 7 episodes you get to know the major players and the intrigue and backstabbing i have contacted pbs about the chance of obtaining a video or dvd but have never received a response too bad i would love to see it again,1
11338,i saw this with my with my kids they love it but i don t she did not get run overfed by a reindeer in the song but what the heck in this crappy movie she got hit by the sleigh it s like what the heck why why when my kids heard the sinked they thought it was good but we they watched this they were like this daddy why did granny thats how my kids say grandma any way my kids said this daddy why did grandma get hit by a sleigh i told them that the movie was crappy they agreed it s sad why would any one name there dog doofas that s just dumb when every one dressed in black that looked so so i mean daphne looked like a dang emo goth girl every one looked like goths in the song they found grandma on the ground i think she died in the song but in this weird crappy movie she was gone i think they should take this show off ok every one would love this i give this a 1 out of 10,0
16631,to experience head you really need to understand where the monkees were when they filmed it this was as their series was coming to a close and the group was near break up their inventive and comedic series sort of an american idol of their day took four unknown actors and formed a manufactured supergroup around them this is their take on their manufactured image and status as the 2nd tier beatles they always felt they were in a box trapped and unable to find credibility despite their talents it is also a hell of a musical trippy inventive i have the soundtrack and full of surprises see it with an open mind,1
22888,some have commented on the subtitles not being a problem in this film i beg to differ the nuisances in the facial expressions and subtle interactions between the characters is such that you can not afford to take your eyes away for even a fraction of a second i tried to watch on the dvd in english to overcome this problem don t make this mistake the result is a travesty the only way to get the full benefit is to watch it two or three times in quick succession so you know it and then ignore the subtitles an acting master class not in the dialogue but body language it is the little things the postmaster shop keeper puffs out his chest and goes in to get his cap before delivering a letter from france the general s bemused expression as his delight in a bunch of perfect grapes elicits a biblical reference with a profundity worthy of being there the cinematography is awesome and the bleak minimalist village with its washed out colour just accentuates the sumptuousness of the feast when it comes i have a friend who claims to be descended from the borgias and who s family motto is if it is worth doing it is worth doing to excess amen i laugh out loud and cry each time i watch this film,1
16661,i just had the opportunity to see nuovomondo hitherto known in the u s as the golden door and was very impressed by both it s dreamy occasionally surreal tale of a family that immigrates from sicially to the u s in the early days of the 20th century it also worked as a proverbial middle finger jammed into the eyeball of homeland security preferably all the way up to the 3rd knuckle in it s depiction of the ill treatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they were getting from their original mother land the mostly italian cast with a few exceptions works well this is a quiet understated film that is lovely to look at the occasional but tasteful use of surrealism is always a pleasure while the screenplay is well written this is a film for those who are sick tired of mindless escapism from hollywood that serves little more than to sell popcorn not that i have any burning issues with popcorn mind you i actually love the stuff you would do wise to seek out nuovomondo the golden door or whatever it s being titled in your area,1
18836,the creepy demons the gentlemen capture the voice of the population of sunnydale to steal human hearts without scream giles find that in accordance with a legend if a lady screams the creatures will be destroyed but buffy and her friends including riley have to fight the monsters speechless hush is certainly the best episode of the fourth season of buffy up to this moment having lots of humor and funny situations i liked a lot spike is hilarious the romance between xander and anya is cool but i loved the intense dialog between buffy and riley in end the gothic scenario of the final battle against the gentlemen recalls the environment of dark city my vote is ten title brazil sil ncio silence,1
14107,morte a venezia is one of my favorite movies more than beautiful it s really sublime it gives you important aesthetic experiences it s a masterpiece i also recommend the novel luchino visconti is a genius,1
16195,capt corelli s mandolin is an old fashioned hollywood war romance but with sex and nudity and supposedly no americans the story takes place on a greek island during ww2 the italians arrive to take over the island but with german supervision there is a romantic triangle made up of a greek couple and the italian captain nice performances by all the actors penelope cruz s best work yet,1
11588,spoiler alert my boyfriend some friends and i rented this movie as part of a marathon of really bad movies we sort of knew what we were getting into but the lack of plot direction and special effects actually left us hoping for a great or passable fight scene between the two main characters the badly rendered swimming cobra and the super violent giant komodo that ate people like scooping ice cream we sort of get this in the end but had to be cut short due to possibly budget or time constraints its one redeeming quality is that its laughably bad with many salient details pointed out by other readers i recommend this movie if your into cutting onions to make yourself cry,0
20578,this movie is excellent i watched the french version there are many subplots which usually detracts from the whole but they nicely unfold and concur to the discovering of one s real self main theme in fact the whole movie besides his background is the journey to the discovery of one s or someone else s self is the king really a good peacenik monarch trying to wage a war to end all wars or is he just a disturbed blood thirsty hoodlum is he a true king after all is the attendant to the queen mother just a lusty career driven spineless sock puppet or rather a sharp thinking bold individual will the dame concubine realize who the king truly is what s between the king and the old chancellor what s the secret everyone knows but won t tell what s the true reason the assassin quit his job subplots something i m not particularly fond of are handled well and keep one watching until the end scenes are well crafted and cgi fits nicely in without going overboard suspense is properly maintained and actors are upto the task there is a lot of brain damaged smiling but that is how one was supposed to behave at the king s court as the dame concubine complains about realistic movie without superhero moments this chinese movie really puts hollywood cardboard colossals gladiator etc to shame,1
11470,not as bad as 1992 s nails where hopper plays an unstable cop but pretty bad how can a movie with such a great cast go so wrong this film manages to find a way the story was pretty stupid and hopper s direction seemed like he had never directed before all of the long shots in the beginning were bothersome lots of meaningless scenes with a lot of meaningless dialogue,0
4784,addle brained stupidity that the cartoon bullwinkle made fun of a quarter century beforehand no dead heroes proves that you can rip off a good movie the manchurian candidate without copying a single sliver of quality from the object of your plunder the acting barely registers on the cable access tv scale the plot is less nuanced than an old sgt rock comic and only boris j badanov style bad guy mustaches are missing from the commies this movie achieves the unusual feat of being too bad too stupid to be enjoyed by anyone with opposable thumbs,0
7192,what a stupid idea ewoks should be enslaved and tortured utterly useless as a species fine you want ten lines of text regarding my unending hatred of ewoks fine here it is fool first of all they are an inferior race that would be slaughtered en mass had lucas not pussified the entire series with their foul presence they re little bears with large asses and they probably smell like donkey crotch yeah i said it donkey crotch they have little to no technology whatsoever resorting to using sticks as makeshift weapons i m surprised they even had access to fire their guttural language makes my skin crawl can t suppress anti ewok rage ahhh,0
2839,me and my friend read the summery and watched the trailer and were very interested and excited to go rent this movie bad idea we thought a movie with actors that influential would have been a sure hit but our expectations fell extremely short first of all the trailer and summery are misleading to the point of lies the movie started out slow for the first 1 1 2 hours reminder its about two hours long and when it finally started to gain momentum it sucked plus the plots were very hard to follow it confused us because it kept skipping from one story to another in random order the characters where not very realistic when it came to reality sure the mum and son could be actual people in reality but everyone else seemed to be one extreme or the other if your a person who likes sick twisted unusual movies then go for it but we advise not wasting two hours of you life you cant get back unfortunitly no one told us that,0
24202,great just great the west coast got dirty harry callahan the east coast got sharky burt reynolds plays sharky in sharky s machine and i enjoyed every minute of it playing a maverick narcotics cop in atlanta ga is just what everyone wants instead of suspension he s sent to vice squad like in the dirty harry movies or any other cop movies the captain is always going to be the jerk when i was a kid i was curious what that movie meant sharky s machine well i knew who played sharky i wonder what his machine was it was his group of fellow cops after uncovering the murder he goes all out to find the perp when it turns out to be a big time mob boss sharky doesn t play around when he gets the other prostitute into safety sharky fights back hard and good despite losing a finger to the thug and i also like the part where the bad gets blown out of the building through a plate glass window that was the bomb randy crawford s street life really put the movie in the right mood and the movie itself is really a great hit to me always rating 4 out of 5 stars,1
667,this might have a spoiler when i first started watching this movie i thought it was ok the music was good and that bizarro dream sequence i was willing to forgive but the lack of looks in the main character and all of the other characters for that matter made me uninterested in watching the rest of this film i know totally vain the music at the beginning was spirited and fitting i thought for a mock gothic novel but come on saxophone music for an early 19th century film it totally didn t fit this movie was totally boring and if you re looking to watch a good period film or an austen don t rent northanger abbey i give it a 30 30 a failing grade,0
2635,this seventh yes you read right the seventh puppet master movie shows how the demented group of dolls came to be by a french puppeteer who uses them to get revenge on a group of ancient mummies who are after him once they learn that he holds the secret to life it was taught to him by a sorcerer also on the run before he died he used this power to bring normal puppets to life this sequel is basically nonsense sprinkled upon even more nonsense like most of the puppet master sequels due to the pg13 rating we don t even get any entertaining puppet murders come to think of it there are no damn puppet murders if there was one franchise that needed to be cut off it would be this one no more god please no more,0
21059,i went to see this film out of curiosity and to settle an argument the film is now best known from the suite of music sergei prokofiev extracted from his incidental music to the film the troika movement even turning up in pop arrangements the general outline of the plot is well known from the sleeve notes on various recordings a clerk accidentally generates a non existent lieutenant kizhe in a list to be presented to the tsar the tsar is interested in this person and rather than tell him he doesn t exist the courtiers and officers maintain the pretence that he is real kizhe is exiled to siberia recalled promoted married promoted again dies is given a state funeral revealed as an embezzler and posthumously demoted to the ranks i had heard conflicting stories about how the clerk invented kizhe involving ink blots and sneezes but i d heard the film was lost so there was no way to find out what happens then the film turned up at the barbican in london as part of their prokofiev festival for the record it turned out that all that happens is that the clerk confuses two words whilst writing an order and turns kuzhe into kizhe as the tsar is in a hurry to see the order there s no time to correct the mistake having gone expecting an historical curiosity i was pleasantly surprised the film is very funny and the audience myself included laughed continuously although most of it is filmed straight set mostly in the palace there are a few trick shots where multiple images appear on the screen for instance the tsar s army is represented by a small group repeated across the screen four identical guards perform perfect drill in perfect unison two identical servants scrub the floor one slight drawback was it was very difficult to work out who everyone was there were two women who might have been the tsar s daughters or a daughter and a servant or something else and very few people were named but all in all an enjoyable film and i m surprised it s not seen more often,1
12276,when this series aired i watched most of it i think it was supposed to be a long running series in the vein of the fugitive and the incredible hulk where the protagonist is being chased around the country looking for a solution to his problems in this case the hero s problem is his progressive aging in reverse i liked what i saw of these shows the acting was good especially the sorrowful relationship between the lead character and his wife problem is they cancelled it before it had a chance to end either that or i missed the last episodes they never got a chance to wrap up the story either knowing it had been cancelled poof it was just gone however like i said before i might have missed the last episodes but my proof to the contrary is this i rented the tape where i left off in the series the lead character s wife dies in a fire started by a chase involving king s famous organization the shop while getting away hero is kidnapped it ends with his friends realizing they have to go save him from the shop the end last episode on the video his wife does not die but escapes the fire with him right when he should get nabbed by the shop he and his wife share a weird moment then phase out of existence abrupt silly and cheap to the extreme they just wanted to put this video out and decided to tag on an ending not caring how bad it was they might as well of just shown some stock footage of the first atomic bomb detonations almost pythonesque the show did have a cool opening title sequence set to the david bowie song of the same name,0
12965,to keep it as simple as possible this is a very good show that is well written and has a fantastic cast it s not loaded with blood and guts and centers around a disgraced cop and his relationship with his ex wife his son his former partner andre braugher his childhood friend now a priest george dzunzda and lastly the person who happens to get into his hack in that episode are you likely to find something like this going on in your city no is this still a good story yes and it s nice to see a man portrayed as good father in spite of his flaws watch more then one 2 3 and you ll see why a lot of us are hooked on this show and thank you david morse for making this character so interesting another good job,1
11246,i never thought i would absolutly hate an arnold schwartzeneggar film but this is is dreadful from the get go there isnt one redeemable scene in the entire 123 long minutes an absolute waste of time thank yu jay harris,0
4980,this movie is not worth seeing at least not at a cinema the story is hard to follow and understand it starts with 10 minutes of something happening 3 years earlier it s hard to know if this movie is trying to be a comedy or just is so bad weird that it sometimes seems like it american sirens and lights on swedish police cars is just one example the acting of persbrandt and bergqvist is good as usual but i think jenny lampa acting as jasmin acts very poor zara zetterqvist acts pretty well she s not been seen as an actor in swedish movies for a long time if you still want to see it wait until it s released on dvd or is shown on tv,0
11130,if you really really really enjoy movies featuring ants building dirt mirrors eating non ants and conquering the world with a voice over narrative then this is the movie for you basically a couple of scientists working out of a bio dome communicate with highly intelligent ants the most intelligent actors in this film in an attempt to try to thwart their plans of conquest and extermination throughout the movie the two scientists and a girl they rescued from the ants use everything at their disposal computers green dye and horrid acting but to no avail i guess they just couldn t afford any pesticides because the movie would be over too quickly the title of the movie phase iv is something of a mystery this is not a spoiler but phase i starts right after the opening credits whereas you don t reach phase iv until the end credits roll apparently the director knew the movie would be tedious to get through and so placed phases 1 3 throughout the movie as a kind of progress report hang in there buddy only 1 more phase until final credits as a mst3k episode this one wasn t very good for two reasons 1 this one is from the season 0 on ktma when they were first starting out so the riffing is not as good as in later seasons and 2 this movie is so bad not even j tb can lighten it up there are one or two gamera references as they had just finished riffing 5 gamera movies the movie does have a trick surprise ending but i was so glad to reach the end the effect was lost on me,0
16473,i ve seen the 1973 movie lost horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie i agree the move had many opportunities for improvement but unlike all those who are looking for the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best acting i was looking for something a bit different and this movie gave it to me i watched this movie not as a critic but as a person looking for a little hope a little cheer a bit of a release from my everyday life and this is what i got you can be critical of the acting the singing and dialog but that t not what i look for when i go to a movie i look for a little release from my daily life a little time where i can sit back and imagine a better life where people love another and help another it s a shame we can t we enjoy a movie for what it tells us and quit picking it apart like an english teacher reading a fifth grade essay this may be very simplistic but really wouldn t it be nice,1
20840,i finally found a version of persuasion that i like anne doesn t look like a scullery maid in this version just a very thin aging pretty woman quite like she s described in the book captain wentworth doesn t look like he s 50 nor does he look perpetually angry but rather as he s described in the book he hasn t aged as much as anne and is quite handsome and they play their parts with such conviction and realism that s what acting is all about they were believable they created real characters and it was like the characters in the book came to life if you haven t seen this version i urge you to find it order it or request it from either a bookstore or a library if you must it s worth the price and worth the wait i watched the 1995 version and the 2007 version and this one towers over the other two why it isn t rated higher is beyond my comprehension the book conveys the tenderness of their relationship and this movie makes the book come to life,1
22113,it seems everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon and say maha go go go the word is macha like mach pronounced maa ka i grew up with this series in the early 70 s here in la on the late and very lamented channel 56 before that there was tetsuwan atomu astro boy dating from 1963 on ol khj tv astro boy was the first tv example of anime we got here in the states i was into anime as a kid and followed it until the late 80 s when by then it d become a series of badly animated talking heads a phenomenon which has only gotten worse nuff said as for speed racer i really enjoyed the basics there the pov shots the cinematic aspects of live action skillfully adopted to animation that was fairly typical of most japanese anime back then graphics graphics graphics take note sometime how obviously the series was inspired by stanley kramer s film grand prix 1966 especially the redone american credits oh yeah i have the original comics from which the series is based so i know of which i speak what were we doing animation wise besides crap like johnny quest th same ol stuff we d been doin since the 20 s ho hum i guess the real problem i had have with the way anime was is shown on american tv is the hatchet job done on the scripts credits etc to sanitize them for american audiences i won t go into other programs as we re talking speed here look at clowns like peter fernandez as one of the culprits here as he was 99 responsible for the re writes of the series not to mention the voice of speed racer x and others between him and the goofs at trans lux think felix the cat and the mighty hercules oy vey they took a slick very sophisticated show and dropped it down to the level of sesame street think cruncher bloch the forthebird company skull duggery if i go on i ll puke this series dates from 40 odd years ago but i at the time was keen enough to feel insulted by the dumbing down of this and other japanese programs i mean it s obvious when someone s getting killed but they either remove it or gloss it over pleeeeeze good show originally sadly all the more recent incarnations of the series have that crappy made in korea look not to mention being nauseatingly pc in content even the japanese outsource their animation now try watchin the original japanese opening on youtube sometime it sends chills up my spine if only oh well robert,1
17992,what is your freaking problem do you have nothing better to do than sit on your fat asses and blog about about how you find something in bad taste here s an idea go outside that s right walk outside your mom s basement that you ve been living in for 13 years and go outside but i can t leave star trek is on in 30 minutes and i still haven t married that avatar on world of warcraft oh my god in that case stay inside alright i might have gone overboard there i mean star trek is okay but i don t really watch it that much anymore either way do you really have to write crap about mind of mencia it s a good show maybe you re just venting your anger because that girl dumped you on world of warcraft or you re constipated try putting fiber in your diet,1
17383,brian keith as cole wlikerson and richard jaeckel as wade matlock make excellent villains they just love intimidating the locals in the most brutal way possible and sneer sexily at any suggestion that there might be a more humane way to achieve their ends it s a pity that goody goody glenn ford gets in their way,1
15316,i don t usually like to see movies while they re still in theaters because of high ticket prices but i saw a poster for some things that stay and i thought that young actress looks intelligent and mysterious not like the usual blonde teenybopper bs so i decided to take the plunge and see this movie on it s opening night i must tell you i was happily surprised i went to this film with no expectations i didn t really know what it would be about but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by katie boland left me feeling rather satisfied with my decision alberta watson also did a fantastic job as the role of tamara s disease stricken mother and i must also add that i was quite impressed with the comedic stylings of megan park as tamara s friend brenda the film was wonderfully directed by gail harvey and pulled together in the kind of kitschy 50 s way that leaves you feeling warm and happy even if the storyline tended not to be so uplifting i also thought that the film was well shot many beautiful images of a 1950 s countryside will remain in my mind for weeks to come this film as a whole was quirky and great i found it to be unpredictable and although the story ends in a somewhat open ended way i was still left satisfied whether you are looking for a fun yet powerful coming of age story or simply want to reminisce about life in the 1950 s i guarantee this film is for you even if you have no expectations it is still quite likely that you will be most impressed give this one a shot,1
3304,well i m a huge fan and follower of elizabeth berkley i bought this on dvd off of ebay for my boyfriends birthday we sat down to watch it and it was so boring i don t remember laughing once it s only on for about an hour and half and it seemed to take forever to end elizabeth is great in this though maybe it s just because i m a big elizabeth berkley fan though if she wasn t in it i wouldn t have watched it but every time she came on my face lit up unfortunately even elizabeth couldn t save this film just the overall story and awful comedy makes this a film you d rather miss than waste an hour and a half of your life it s a very forgetful film,0
17298,octavio paz mexican poet writer and diplomat who received the nobel prize for literature in 1990 said about nazarin nazarin follows the great tradition of mad spaniards originated by cervantes his madness consists in taking seriously great ideas and trying to live accordingly a humble and spiritual priest francisco rabal in a wonderful performance attempts to live by the principles of christianity but is cast out of his church for helping a local prostitute by giving her a shelter after she had committed a murder nazarin wanders the country roads of the turn of the 20th century mexico offering help to poor and begging for food his two followers a murderous prostitute andara and her sister beatriz who is a failed suicide desperately searching for love consider him saint but it does not prevent him from hatred and humiliation from both the church and the people he meets on the road he ends up beaten in prison and begins to question his faith for not be able to forgive his attacker bunuel tells the story in a manner of a christian parable masterfully and uniquely combining admiration and irony for the main character and strong criticism of formal religion and hypocrisy the film is simple and profound as well as beautiful ironic and heartbreaking i consider bunuel one of the best filmmakers ever i ve seen twenty of his films and they all belong to the different periods of his life but they have in common his magic touch the masterful combination of gritty realism and surrealism his curiosity his inquisitive mind his sense of humor and his dark and shining fantasies with great pleasure i am adding little seen and almost unknown but amazingly candid and touching surrealistic tragic comedy nazarin to the list of my favorite films,1
11426,the shining has wit visual flair and an iconic performance by jack nicholson ausentes however has none of these things although it does borrow from its classic forebear to wit a man hacking through a door and a woman running around shrieking while clutching a huge kitchen knife unlike stanley kubrick s great psychological horror film ausentes is a work which resonates with a singular lack of genius it is magnificently comically awful it makes the spice girls movie look like a work of vital art ausentes is the tale of a family that moves to a gated community in the suburbs all is to be well with the world they will live in peace and tranquillity they will calmly go about their business away from those mean old city streets but no ariadna gill s character julia starts getting spooked by those things that insist on going bump in the night by empty supermarkets and doors that close themselves and her husband samuel played by jordi molla switches in an instant from laid back family man to wild eyed permanently unshaven nutter injecting julia with a drug to keep her under his sudden cosh molla much respected as an actor is absolutely dreadful in this comic rather than menacing he simply cannot pull off a threatening expression he just come across as a barroom slime ball who s had one drink too many so is there anything to redeem this film no the script is clunky the plot non existent and the cast without merit completely without tension and full of be scared now moments ausentes is an exercise in how not to make a psychological thriller it is ridiculous and overblown but as one of the most unintentionally hilarious films of recent years it s well worth a watch,0
16270,chaplin enters the trenches of wwi in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war the rain the mud the explosions all these things are present but chaplin seems strangely oblivious to them all he s in france for one thing to fight the germans something he does with unbelievable success it almost seems like an extended ego trip for chaplin a very funny one at that until the final minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and everything makes sense perhaps it s what all soldiers dream of before the go to war,1
11657,there are interesting pieces here of and about bruce weber s likes and dislikes maybe if a professional editor had put it together for biography i would have felt more satisfied instead i spent 8 at a film festival on it for an autobiography almost nothing is revealed about bruce weber other than he likes to look at photographs shoot interesting people especially beautiful teenage boys and listen to jazz the director of crumb would have made a much more interesting and cohesive film,0
8996,i love umberto lenzi s cop movies rome armed to the teeth is my favorite and his desert commandos pretty much legitimized the italian euro war phenomenon by managing to actually be a pretty good movie give him guns machines some guys to run around talking tough and it s hard for him to miss what a shame it is then to encounter his eaten alive and cannibal ferox they could have been by anybody really and one watches them with a sense that he was under contract was told what kind of films to make was assigned a cast crew and given a budget deadline and script lenzi then went out and executed his films the same way that a guy at mcdonald s fixes a batch of french fries of the two eaten alive is the more original which is kind of amazing considering that it features extensive footage copped from three other cannibal movies and easier to enjoy than cannibal ferox though not much i will let others outline the plot what fascinated me about the film is how staged it all looks and yet what a somewhat infamous reputation this film has as some sort of all out assault on good taste it isn t though the film is an exercise in bad taste complete with a title earning scene where two of the pretty supporting ladies are quite literally sliced up and eaten alive by cannibals which is the film s high point the problem is that lenzi lets us get a good long look at the cannibal feast scene and it has the convincing ring of a 3rd season star trek episode complete with a fake jungle set for the really gory close up shots and i don t know about anyone else but if someone was slicing off pieces of my person and eating them i wouldn t just lie there and look distressed my problem with the film might be that i have a lot of respect for lenzi as a filmmaker and again this could have been directed by anybody all of your cannibal movie conventions are touched on but it never feels like they are filmed with any real conviction other than to try and bully ruggero deodato out of the sandbox the two directors certainly must have known each other and either had a sort of juvenile rivalry or an actual dislike for each other s work and a conscious need to upstage them lenzi invented the cannibal genre with man from deep river deodato blew it away with jungle holocaust lenzi fired back with eaten alive deodato blew him and everyone else away with the superior cannibal holocaust and lenzi fired a last parting salvo with cannibal ferox which is about as realistic as that krazy glu commercial where the guy superglues his hardhat to a girder and hangs in midair this film is less desperate and a bit more hesitant to push viewers into the abyss with everything holy than ferox which remains as a sort of misguided attempt to upstage cannibal holocaust this one is more of a mish mash with an interesting jungle adventure crossed with a jim jones like suicide cult the cannibals seem like they were added as an afterthought rather than the reason for making the film i think that fans of the genre will have a better impression of the film than fans of lenzi s films looking for something new by the formidable director it isn t as entertaining as slave of the cannibal god adventurous as his own man from deep river and certainly lacks the wallop of cannibal holocaust combine those considerations with the recycled footage stomach churning scenes of animal violence misogynistic scenes of sexual violence and stagy wooden methodology of film making and what you get ends up being an ok jungle thriller with two or three standout scenes and umberto lenzi was capable of so much more 4 10 gore freaks will go nuts however,0
2049,wow this movie was horrible as a bills fan i was really looking forward to it but this was bad they should have left it on the shelf it was on for 4 years i can t believe a guy like jon voight would sign on for something like this,0
716,this was the worst wrestlemania in history the only good matches were ricky steamboat vs hercules hernandez and the tag title match between the british bulldogs and the dream team this one bordered on classic everything else was either poor or awful the idea of having three host cities was unnecessary confusing and messed up the fluidity of the show the celebrity guests were terrible on commentary especially susan saint james if you re interested in the mid 80 s wwf you re better renting or buying wrestlemania 3 or just about any other ppv for that matter,0
24793,my wife and i loved this film smart dialogue great characters clever plot construction the pacing in this film is non stop couldn t even get to the kitchen for some munchies we have never seen corey feldman this funny taylor nichols plays a good fed my wife loves him on that married man hbo show the ensemble cast were all strong the twist at the end had us cheering that is why we give this film a standing o,1
24008,i ve seen both movies and i saw without a doubt the re make is the best i know a lot of people would disagree those who have become fans of the original will most probably not like this re make but i thought it was well thought out and definitely scary it was so good i m going to see it again tonight the original creeped me out because they kill the children i mean who does that in movies anyway but in this one the children have at least half a chance the only bad part about this movie is when the babysitter jill walks towards the sounds she hears and runs outside into the bushes to check for someone clearly no one in their right mind would do that whilst babysitting so that is the only thing i found wrong with the movie and even so they probably had to put that in there to build suspense i don t want to give too much away for all those who have not seen it i recommend you do instead of listening to all these people saying its crap and worse than the original it would be a better movie for teenagers as it displays things that most of us are scared of but when i was in the movies there were at least 10 adults over the age of 70 in there watching it and they enjoyed it if they enjoyed it i think you will to i give it a 9 out of 10,1
21762,the chaser s war on everything is a weekly show from the guys that brought you cnnnn and the chaser decides where each week the 5 chasers and firth break down the issues that we didn t know were important this show goes beyond the mere satirizing of politics and television by not being afraid to take the mickey out of anyone whether it be a counter girl at subway or even the prime minister of australia and although this may be familiar ground in say american television it has never been this well executed the chaser s war on everything is the smartest funniest and overall most entertaining show on australian television and if you haven t seen it you seriously owe it to yourself to give it a watch,1
20887,operation scorpio akathe scorpion king doesn t slip into top gear until the last 25 minutes or so but when the action does hit top speed it delivers some truly amazing martial arts scenes that demand the viewer s attention that is not to say that the first hour is worthless just that compared to the final fight fest it seems a bit underwhelming the plot revolves around yuk su a talented comic artist who dreams of being a hero just like those he depicts in his drawings when yuk su rescues a young maid siu yu who is being sold into prostitution he incurs the wrath of her evil boss wa led by sonny master of scorpion style kung fu wa s henchmen give chase to yuk su and the maid yuk su s father intervenes but he is injured after being rescued by some friendly bodybuilders the three eventually hide out at a noodle restaurant owned by their friend master yat yuk su learns to cooks noodles but also regularly sneaks out in order to secretly build his strength and learn kung fu under the tutelage of jean the teacher of the musclebound hulks who rescued them when master yat must leave on business yuk su is left in charge of the kitchen however he pops out to practise his skills with jean leaving siu yu to serve the customers sonny and his men visit the restaurant and disgusted by the noodles they are served trash the restaurant when master yat learns that yuk su has been sneaking out he tells him that he should have learnt kung fu from him it transpires that master yat used to be a top triad assassin until he decided to try and change his ways under the guidance of master yat yuk su improves his skills even learning the art of the shadowless kick yuk su eventually gets a chance to try and become a real hero when his friend fatty announces that his maid has also been sold into prostitution with jean they visit wa posing as french brothel keepers looking for new women when fatty s maid is presented to them she accidentally blows their ruse and at last the action kicks off big style despite his best efforts jean is badly beaten by sonny and he and yuk su are forced to flee on returning to the restaurant yuk su finds it ablaze and worst of all the bad guys have found siu yu yuk su accompanied by master yat returns to wa s place to try and rescue siu yu despite some fairly entertaining training scenes the slow build up to the final action at wa s house is rather too drawn out and devoid of any serious fight scenes it is a shame that the tedium wasn t broken up by a decent scrap midway rather than saving all of the juicy stuff until the end the last fight however is worth the wait in the end won jin gives a jaw dropping performance as the high kicking sonny who scuttles flips and spins with amazing skill and dexterity and chin kar lok gives a solid performance as yuk su the artist turned fighter also particularly good is old school kung fu star lau kar leung aka liu chia liang as master yat proving that this old timer has still got what it takes to kick ass although not a perfect film operation scorpio has enough standout action in its finale to definitely warrant a viewing nb i may have got some of the names wrong my dvd calls characters by different names than those listed on imdb,1
9637,if you are going to make a movie from any book be sure that the characters are consistant with that book this movie not only defied the biblical story that has been told for thousands upon thousands of years to children one way or another but it clearly took liberties that no adaptation would probably ever try at least the lord of the rings is close enough to the books that people understand the story more if they read the books than this noah s ark tried to,0
12245,that s what i felt like yelling as well as stomping out of the theater but i restrained myself yes the acting was great no this wasn t the typical hollywood film but the dialogue just wouldn t end or get interesting and despite all the gabbing you never get to really know or care about any of the characters definitely the most boring film i ve seen since sphere but i was expecting that one to be boring i had to sit through it but please spare yourself,0
20597,latter days is a very very independent movie and compared to many of today s more modern films it s lacking on many parts the shooting seems at times quite amateurish the dialogues can be a bit chopped up and the characters are not impressively complex so don t have too high hopes for this movie because as i ve said it s very independent but whatever it lacks in the concrete aspects of the film can be overlooked because of the story s charm i cannot claim that the plot is outstandingly original but the story is still beautiful and heart warming in many ways it s not about being gay versus being straight it s about faith and how you decide to run your own life it s a silly story that makes you want to both cry and smile at the same time so to be honest latter days is far from perfect but i truly loved the movie and i highly recommend it it s very critical towards the religious aspects of our society and there is homosexuality involved but approach it with an open mind and i m pretty sure that most people will enjoy it as much as myself,1
2961,dear friends i ve never seen such a trash movie as night of the demons 1988 it seems that the director kevin tenney had the intention to copy classics like the evil dead by sam raimi 1978 or george a romero s return of the living dead from the same year the cinematography was lousy the movie was very dark so i had to turn the brightness control to the maximum indeed horror pictures have to be dark but not the way like night of the demons the entire movie was ridiculous no suspense worse actors except alvin alexis in the role of rodger and horrible make up effects an average vote of 5 stars for that movie i can t believe this perhaps the users were pleased about the tits asses and pussies of the actresses they were indeed worth 5 stars regards hans dieter,0
7140,and never ever see it now i ve been watching bad scifi movies for years i love watching bad scifi movies i think that was the only reason i could watch this movie the whole way through i was toughened up by nukie indian superman and that awful fantastic four movie just to name some examples usually i have to beat my head against the wall after i ve seen a bad movie to make some of the pain go away no not with this one with tdb i had to hit myself in the head with a shoe in the middle of the movie temporary fix i can t believe i wanted to see that i cried when it finished i cried it was horrible it was worse than when i saw shudders wil wheaton in his underwear in the curse which by the way never watch either aside from the fact that wesley crusher s in his tighty whiteys it s just sooo bad but this review is about tdb the worst part about it is that someone wrote this movie and said this deserves to go on film it s great and wayne newton rob lowe and everyone else in the cast said oh this is what i want on my film history i ll watch indian superman until the cows come home but i am never going to see this steaming pile of dren again,0
15445,spoilers ahead mel has got it going on from the opening credits to the ending credits this movie has straight laughs dave chappel shows why he is a comedic force cary eewes carries the movie most of the time but the supporting cast fills in strong when the plot is drawn away from robin hood right from the beginning this movie proclaims it s self not to be taken seriously if you took a time machine and gave the characters thoughts of modern day antics you would get this movie what makes this movie special you say throughout the movie you see blinken and acuhu walk beside each other becoming great friends as robin hood s sidekicks but it blinken is never told or fails to grasp that he is black until the crowd says a black sheriff blinken replays he s black that is a timeless scene simple one of the most enteraining movies of our time,1
18303,oz is a great series one of televisions underrated shows it has a certain relationship to soap opera in that something evil is always happening and it is the unfolding of each instance of evil that fascinates from my discussions with people who are actually in prison it rings true every interaction has some machination working in the background behind every action there lies a scheme a plot to do someone else in i like this series so much that it is one of the few tv shows i have bought completely on dvd and yes i agree with the writer before me who commented that there are elements of satire in it the character in the wheelchair who offers his jaundiced view of life does so with a certain bit of ironic humor,1
10262,the idea behind dead silence is great zombie outbreak takes place during an edgy paranoia radio talk show there was so much going for this film unfortunately as soon as the zombies made their appearance all was lost the film is ridiculous and only those with a passion for cheesy b flick horror will enjoy it the zombies were soooo stupid they ran around flailing their arms they looked like a bunch of people putting on a haunted house for elementary students i know this is a brief review but i just don t see the need to invest much into this it s a dumb movie you ve been warned,0
11259,yes it s pure trash it might be interesting for every guy who likes experimental cinema like me to see lowlifes babbling and doing nothing for almost two hours but it gets very painful when you realize you have actually paid for this probably this is one of those films you love to watch for its complete emptiness and nihilism i accept it though for its shock value decades before trainspotting and pulp fiction,0
3073,anybody who thinks this film is great desperately needs their head seen to it strikes me that this film was made as a joke it has no good points whatsoever the props cost about 10 and the entire set looks like it could fall down at any time why do films like this get made in the first place this also had two of the most annoying characters i have ever come across in the young boy on the spaceship and the redneck from the twentieth century this film is almost as bad as cool as ice starring the incredibly talented vanilla misunderstood ice,0
17690,living just down the hwy from georgetown co i remember this movie well and thought it was great the story seems like something john would do even in real life but there is something that i will always remember most about the movie for those of you who don t live in denver every christmas the city of denver co puts up a fabulous display of lights and decorations at the civic center in downtown denver well as it so happened during the filming of this movie a nativity scene was needed so it was borrowed from the civic center display with permission by the way someone had forgotten to advice the powers that be and it was reported stolen a frantic search began with law enforcement for a few days finally someone spoke up and remembered loaning it to the film crew in georgetown it was returned and put back where it belonged as it turns out it wasn t featured all that much in the movie you can barely see it during the christmas show with the children it did create quit a disturbance though,1
2967,once in a great while i will watch a movie that completely surprises me one that comes out of nowhere to be a bit of rousing entertainment one that is pure fun from beginning to end well folks when a stranger calls is not that movie it is an unbelievable stupid and far fetched remake of the much better 1979 horror camp classic our lead heroine jill is forced to babysit after going over her cell phone minutes and is harassed by telephone calls from a mysterious caller every clich in the world is used here from the stupid cat jumping out of a hidden spot to the car that won t start to the killer can be anywhere at anytime this movie is bad not even bad in a so bad it s good way more in a so bad it s boring way skip this godawful film and save your movie for something else you ll thank me later trust me on this grade d,0
21790,i went into the closer she gets knowing that it was the story of the filmmaker s mother fighting cancer i expected it to be a very harrowing depressing movie and although the subject matter is certainly emotionally wrenching the remarkable thing about this movie is the positive message it sends it shows a family s total dedication to meet the challenge of cancer together they refuse to lose faith in each other even in the darkest moments the most moving moments to me are when this faith is revealed little comments that the mother and the family make to each other that reveal her and their will to survive and their defiant emphasis on love and family togetherness in this way it is an uplifting and profoundly hopeful film we should all be so lucky as to be surrounded by family like this in times of serious illness,1
21590,wow this was a great movie i just got it from the u s and it was worth all the money i gave for it this movie is one of the best movies for children i have ever seen maybe the best all you who like rainbow brite must see this 1 the first 7 minutes you can not believe what you see it s so great scooter,1
3636,maybe i saw a cleaned up version but other than a few flashes of breasts i m not sure what over the top nudity these other commenters are referring to all in all not as bad as i was expecting by the previous comments although the end leaves you wondering wtf it was dark but not so much that you couldn t make out the scenes and i think it just added to the creepiness and the terror of the situation film quality could have been better but the acting was pretty decent all in all a decently creepy and yes brutal movie with a disappointing ending,0
14167,after the across the board success of my name is barbra cbs television permitted barbra to create an even more elaborate follow up as her second special streisand wisely knew in order to follow in the ground breaking success of my name is barbra that her second special would indeed need to raise the bar even further in inventiveness and spectacle not surprisingly she succeeded once again even more impressively streisand managed to mount this large production without sacrificing the intimacy and vision of my name is barbra once again the special is divided into three distinct acts filming on location at bergdorf goodman s department store was so successful in the first special that streisand and company decided to film on location once again for the first act of this second special the decided upon location this time was the philadelphia art museum which would allow endless chances for barbra to enter different art works that would correspond with the songs being performed in addition to the numerous artistic possibilities that this location made possible the museum would offer the perfect opportunity to take advantage of filming in color after the recording of draw me a circle that is set against the opening credits barbra then dashes around the museum in a maid costume to the strains of kern and harbach s yesterdays she stops to admire various paintings and statues often becoming the character that is depicted and singing a thematically appropriate song streisand performs a bittersweet rendition of hammerstein and romberg s one kiss as thomas eakin s concert singer delivers a hilariously campy performance of chopin s minute waltz as marie antoinette embraces abstract art with the frenetic rhythm of peter matz s gotta move and performs a wrenching rendition of non c est rien as a distraught modigliani girl the high point of act i however is when streisand compares profiles with the bust sculpture of egyptian queen nefertiti while singing a tour de force rendition of rogers and hart s where or when the act ii circus medley allows streisand to interact with various farm and circus animals while singing various songs with farm circus animal themes some highlights include barbra singing were thine that special face to a baby elephant performing i ve grown accustomed to that face as a serenade to a piglet the campy sam you made the pants to long sung to a group of baby penguins and barbra comparing profiles with an anteater while crooning we have so much in common streisand also swings on a trapeze and leaps from a trampoline to the chorus of spring again and then slows things down by performing a haunting version of i stayed too long at the fair while seated alone on stage barbra also gets the chance to show off her pet poodle sadie in this segment and even speak a little french the act iii concert is once again the high point of the hour dressed in a slenderizing white wool dress the concert segment is performed on a uniquely designed stage with a partial staircase that leads nowhere streisand opens the act with a sultry rendition of harold arlen s anyplace i hang my hat is home before launching into heartfelt versions of the familiar standard it had to be you and the rarely heard c est si bon it s so good streisand then really amazes the audience with a breathtakingly powerful octave soaring performance of the sweet charity ballad where am i going of which streisand delivers the definitive rendition of streisand also introduces the then newly written richard maltby jr david shire ballad starting here starting now which contains an impassioned vocal from streisand that ranks among the very best vocal performances of her long career more than anything else color me barbra was a showcase for streisand s ever increasing mega watt star power despite the presence of even more visual razzle dazzle streisand herself is always the main attraction her voice sounds as beautiful as ever and this special was the first to showcase how strikingly she photographs in color as with my name is barbra color me barbra was another rating smash and spawned yet another top five gold selling soundtrack album simply put color me barbra defies tradition and emerges as a sequel that is nearly on par with a classic original,1
4496,i should know better i ve seen too many of rob lowe s early work to expect anything good from this movie even if it is about hockey here we have yet again another tired sports theme kid has potential for greatness has the apparent to go far if his cocky attitude doesn t screw things up and boom he comes out of it as that helluva player kind of champion is that all that can be said of sports movies surely there must be other feats that athletes undertake nonetheless this movie has got to be one of the biggest cheeseballs everybody s interactions are just downright silly and not in a stupid funny kind of manner and i can t think of any ancillary qualities that could enliven my position not the actors certainly not swayze who plays lowe s reluctant mentor not the story not the music and very little from the skating sequences normally i m a sucker for 80s movies even if they do tend to be a little fishy i e north shore the karate kid but this doesn t even make for good 80s trash for a good 80s sports movie check elsewhere there s plenty of them out there,0

4544,the chilling directed by deland nuse and jack a sunseri is one of the worst zombie flicks i have ever seen why linda blair the exorcist witchery appeared in this stinker is beyond me the plot is really dumb the frozen bodies at a cryogenic lab are revived after lightening strikes and turned into cannibalistic zombies the characters are completely one dimensional and stupid the zombies look horrible and there is no gore avoid this cheap piece of trash like the plague my rating 1 out of 10,0
9409,another entry in the pacino as mentor sub genre you know the drill young hotshot with hubristic flaw in this case matthew mcconaughey trying to jump start a flagging career by latching onto pacino s coattails hey it worked for keanu and colin didn t it is discovered by glamorous and delightfully corrupt father figure pacino natch young hotshot learns from father figure all the ins and outs of a lucrative yet degrading career this time it s football handicapping father figure plies young hotshot with money and hookers and power but we all know that this decadent state of affairs is on a collision course with dissolution and despair that is until the young hotshot finds his moral center by rejecting the father figure and all or almost all that he stands for clearly stone s wall street pretty much set the ground rules for the pacino as mentor sub genre we are also meant to take these latter day pacino films as a parallel to reality again you know the drill living legend actor demonstrates his unquestioned superiority as compared to an inferior young actor the latter may bear and grin through the process but he must recognize that he isn t going to get any of the good lines much less get a chance to chew major scenery before the denouement now it must be said that there are actually two good movies in the pacino as mentor canon scent of a woman and donnie brasco in the former case it was a one man show anyway in the latter case pacino had met his match as a scene stealer in the person of johnny depp however those two movies were serious minded not merely an exercise in showboating for showboating s sake pacino has made damn certain that his younger co stars in the films since brasco are nowhere near as charismatic as depp by the way none of this speaks very well about the living legend actor like his contemporary de niro pacino has spent the last 10 or 15 years resting on his laurels two for the money is the worst example yet worse even than devil s advocate which at least had the virtues of featuring a naked connie nielsen and being chronologically prior to this movie well this is what happens when you re crowned king too damn early just ask marlon brando frankly i ve seen one too many al pacino films with the same plot and the same overacting from the star to be charitable any longer did i say none of this speaks well actually it s humiliating for everyone involved including the paying audience no one s going to accuse matthew mcconaughey of being a shakespearean actor but even he doesn t deserve the role of second fiddle to this intolerable old show off with the added implication that he mcconaughey will never measure up to the greatness that is al i ve not wasted space on the plot particulars if you want a synopsis imdb provides a no nonsense summary though i think i laid out a fairly comprehensive summary in my opening paragraph basically you ve seen this movie before many times the particular milieu in two for the money is the seedy world underworld really of sports handicapping pacino runs an office of bet advisers that is middlemen between you and your bookie and even has a cable tv handicapping show co hosted with several of his top guys one thing the movie got right was the sleaziness of these type of shows but one detail they got dead wrong was the constant use of the words gamble and gambling if you ve ever seen proline or other shows of similar ilk you ll never never hear jim feist and his cohorts say the word gamble they ask you to call their 1 900 number to get their picks but if you were from say mars you d have no idea what you were supposed to do with those picks gamble is the f word on sports handicapping tv shows strictly verboten gambling is against the law you know 1 star out of 10,0
5056,i heard this movie was bad they even warned me it was terrible but for some reason probably katie holmes i still watched it when it came on national tv watching kevin williamson films means torturing his scenarios aren t funny definitely not scary and not the least bit creative teaching mrs tingle breathes the same irritating atmosphere as his brainless series dawson s creek and it s probably meant for the same target group as well before the credits even started 5 people already wanted a hug and they stated that eerie i love you sentence it doesn t get any better as the soundtrack is filled with annoying pop rock and the storyline is ultra thin three students on the verge of graduation get caught cheating by the wickedest teacher in school every high school has a teacher like that you know to save their skin they try to convince mrs tingle that it wasn t their intention to cheat but this attempt goes horrible wrong the typical high school humor is completely lost on me the overdose of sentiment is pathetic and the acting with the exception of helen mirren is abominable i m sure katie holmes can act that s a fact proven by her role in the gift but she urgently needs to stop accepting frumpish girl roles as said before the only positive comments goes out to the brilliant casting of helen mirren as the shrew it s like kathleen turner in serial mom the role suits her perfectly and you can t imagine anyone else playing her other than that this is avoidable teenage nonsense,0
22297,milo is an overlooked underrated horror flick from the late 90 s but the feel and atmosphere is more that of an 80 s horror flick seems a bunch of little girls are taken to see things at the office of milo s father a gynecologist and as a reward for getting to see what s there in jars yes a gynecologist plus something else one girl plays doctor with milo hmm his first patient and he lost her now milo is a creepy little kid that always wears a yellow rain slicker rain or shine and he talks funny but that s not all that s strange about him fast forward to the present where these girls are adults and there s a wedding planned for one of them but tragedy strikes and leaves one girl that came in from out of town with a choice of whether or not to replace her friend as a school teacher which she does and then strange things begin to happen again which of course involve this little kid in a rain slicker this isn t overly violent or graphic but has a distinct creepiness that you don t find in many modern horror flicks and it s well worth seeing one wonders why it s so hard to find any good horror flicks in this day age but here s one that s criminally overlooked and definitely worth your time if you check it out 8 out of 10,1
18277,this is a thoughtful film that lays bare the inequities of the so called upper class and those who work for them the haves and have nots robert shaw does a creditable job in his role as the obliging correct chauffeur steven ledbetter who helps lady franklin sarah miles overcome her mental depression at the outset however steven has many mixed feelings regarding this lady of the upper class he inevitably falls in love with her which of course is overstepping the societal boundaries that separate them i have not read anything prior to this and only judge the movie as i have seen it i consider it a very honest story about the realities of daily living and the conflict of what we might wish or expect from life and what we get it s a fine drama worth seeing again,1
7805,sorry folks i love ray bolger s work but the one thing he ain t is a leading man maybe if you pretend he s the last man on earth this romantic plot might work but come on now here s a movie that exists simply to showcase the title song which was a big hit for the basie band the year before 1951 and some pretty nifty singing and dancing save it from being a total disaster however the story line is pathetic even by 1952 musical comedy standards and the other songs are equally as forgettable as evening in paris cologne the dialogue embarrasses the stars day bolger only claude dauphin s boyeresque charms keep his character three dimensional so how to enjoy this movie on video a fast forward through all the dialogue b surrender yourself to doris day s vocals and ray bolger s loose limbed footwork and don t miss dauphin s hilarious take on a rain soaked windswept reprise of april in paris c finally keep a couple of bottles of cabernet chilled and handy bob raymond,0

15692,this movie is wonderful i can watch it again and again robin hood is perfectly cast and marian is beautiful i personally think marian s german man is the funniest character along with latrine and the sheriff while space balls got boring and stupid after a while this one always keeps your interest w o n d e r f u l this was a great film and never gets boring a great cast is in the roles and it is spoofed perfectly and makes so much sense and can be watched again and again you will love this film if you ll only watch it except if you hate comedy or does not think robin hood should be tampered with but this old story gets boring and this movie gives it a great new flavor,1
17706,there is no plot there are no central characters there are no moving cameras or close ups in fact this film does not follow any of the conventional storytelling techniques used by mainstream film however roy andersson s du levande is a remarkable piece of cinematic storytelling it is a touching look at the human psyche comprised of a series of vignettes roy andersson gives us an intimate insight into what makes us all human in perfectly framed static shots added with the perfectly in tune yet quirky music roy introduces us to a host of characters as they undertake their daily existence some bordering on tragic others hilarious we are taken on a nordic journey like no other it is a journey into the little things that make us human instead of over the top storytelling or visual techniques everything is stripped down to the bare minimum so that our sole focus is on the characters themselves it focuses on the insignificant points of our lives that make us who we are our dreams our desperation it s through this simple observation of others that we can accept who we are as individuals the washed out colours and deathly pale makeup of the characters only seems to emphasize their individual stories and remind us that unlike them we are all alive there is no happy ending or light at the end of the tunnel in this film yet you walk out of the cinema with a sense of life much more accessible than his earlier film songs from the second floor du levande is a truly inspiring piece of cinema,1
18560,hit and run is a shattering story starring the always wonderful margaret colin as a society lady who has it all until she hits a child with her car and leaves the scene hence the title the tragedy is that she goes to call for help and returns but is frightened away by angry passers by who think the hitter abandoned the scene this was made in the days when not everyone had a cell phone or there wouldn t be a story colin s guilt and anguish are palpable and cause her to act so strangely that a detective gets onto her right away her lies sink her deeper and deeper into a self loathing hole causing her to make a bad situation worse this is a very thought provoking story and one can t help but to feel this lady s pain wishing throughout that she would simply come clean as a tv movie thanks to colin and a strong script this is a well above average tv movie,1
17281,riding high on the success of rebel without a cause came a tidal wave of teen movies arguably this is one of the best a very young mcarthur excels here as the not really too troubled teen the story concentrates more on perceptions of delinquency than any traumatic occurrence the supporting cast is memorable frankenheimer directs like an old pro just a story of a young man that finds others take his actions much too seriously,1
9721,i tried to give this show a chance but it really doesn t sit well with me although the performances are good the writing isn t the two oldest step siblings derek and casey are equally annoying i get the impression that we re supposed to side with casey given that she s the protagonist but i don t find her at all likable the parents are continually portrayed as utterly clueless the three younger children are the most watchable things on the show lizzie and edwin are sweet the way they team up and marti is adorable the plot lines are a bit far fetched and the whole premise is mostly hard to swallow blended families are common yes but this family isn t really trying all that hard to blend on the whole i think it grades thumbs down,0
16731,one of the most magnificent movies ever made the acting of charles buchinski later known as bronson is simply outstanding this is the crown on the career of director winner who himself was often quoted saying this was his masterpiece the plot has been copied many times but it s never been topped wildey j moore the gun manufacturer many times claimed his brand s growth since the mid 80s can be fully credited to dw3 and rightly so this is not just a movie this is art that many generations will admire and appreciate although this movie has never been fully appreciated in the usa it has found a huge following in europe and asia where the movie is regularly shown at film schools and it is still a popular hit in student cinemas all across europe all in all a true classic,1
16127,unconditional love is surprisingly entertaining while the plot goes off in perhaps too many directions making for an overlong movie it never fails to charm and ingratiate itself the several plotlines one warmly reminiscent of shirley valentine provide ample smiles laughs wisdom and tenderness it all shouldn t work and at times it certainly bumps along but forgive its inconsistencies sit back and have a good time it s a charmer,1
15773,having seen and loved this film in australia i was very keen to get me paws on a copy i got one on dvd back in the uk only to find that it s a very different edit the domestic australain edit i saw is snappier the uk and i presume european edits spends a lot longer on the narrator played by jimmy s dead brother and in truth belabours that and few other points to no real benefit it is not a serious criticism but the oz edit is just brisker and i think more assured i can t say why they felt it needed expansion for the overseas market so careful about which one you go for i went for both,1
7679,the first time i had heard of guest house paridiso was in the er washroom after having just seen fight club in each urinal was deposited a small round black circle when the circle came into contact with moisture to put it delicately it caused a colour picture to form with photographs of the two stars and the tag line you ll p yourself laughing when you d finished washing your hands the circle had dried and faded to black again waiting to spring it s surprise on the next victim okay maybe the punchline wasn t terribly sophisticated but you have to admit it was innovative in fact i think i can honestly say i ve never seen anything like it in my life before and these days of over a century of cinema and marketing that s a real feat what a pity the film that went with it failed to live up to the promise i hate to pan guest house paridiso and i am indebted to rik mayall richard twat and adrian edmondson eddie elizabeth ndingombaba for many years of laughter through their appealing television series be it the invention of the young ones 1982 1984 the sitting room plays of bottom 1991 1995 or even solo work such as rik in the new statesman 1988 1993 in fact this would have made an hilarious 45 minute tv special unfortunately its an 89 minute film there s definitely some merit to be had and i laughed continuously throughout the protracted finale which spoofed the exorcist and raiders of the lost ark and involved well you ll have to see that bit for yourself yet often the pace is leaden and a sterile atmosphere is throughout the two stars edmondson taking his usual backseat this time due to the fact that he adequately directs never really get into first gear mayall only sporadically showing the foul mouthed mania that makes us love him on the small screen indeed the writers presumption that we are already familiar with the characters leads to them being underdelivered to the audience the slight hints of depth seen in the series richie s effeminate failed social climbing for example are not present here and instead we are left with parodies of parodies the fawlty towers accusation does pass water complete with drunken chef and unseen called for waiter pasquele which uncannily rhymes with manuel some of the ideas such a hotel next to a nuclear reactor with a childrens swing hanging over a cliff face are very very funny but ultimately the frenetic pace is stolen the two constantly looking for a studio audience that isn t there and all the dead laugh areas patched up with incidental comedy music that would have been dated in a carry on film two decades ago paridiso s brand of puerile sadistic perverse humour is funny and i feel sure it will make you laugh just not as often as it should,0
8389,a bad quentin tarantino rip off at least i hope that s what they were going for because at least then i could respect the director for admiring tarantino one scene a singing scene with rose mcgowan is far to well done and genius for this film and could have only been stumbled on by mistake by this director so besides his quinton inspiration and rose mcgowan and her one good scene this film sucked some of the crappiest dialogue i have ever heard i m willing to bet why mcgowan doesn t speak much is because of how crappy her dialogue would have been tries to be funny never is tries to be dark and isn t tries to be stylish and is just bland who dishes out the money to make movies like this i m hoping it was all the directors so no one else s money was wasted if not for mcgowan the whole cast is awful and when mcgowan is your best hmmm i gotta wonder,0
19053,this is a harrowing movie and it moves relentlessly still it is utterly unique among war films in that it focuses exclusively on the civilian experience the loss of humanity ordinary people undergo during wartime the two young married musicians undergo a slow battering process of degradation at the hands of both sides of a civil war utterly stripped of sentimentality the film offers a bleak vision of the modern world and one i believe particularly recognizable to many europeans with brave intense performances by liv ullmann never better and max von sydow likewise for my money the most indelible film bergman ever created,1
4389,this movie was sooooooo sloooow and everything in it was bland the acting the plot etc it was such a disappointment since the description looked so good do not be fooled this movie is not worth the time it takes to watch it,0
17943,this film is a great comedy drama christopher walken is tremendous in his supporting role as manager and his commentary will keep you laughing robin williams plays a great role as a quick wit jon stewart and will amuse you if you are fans of comedy central the show is good because if the viewer has half a brain they will see it as a very needed sub cultural attack on the policies of the current republican government and a criticism on the american democratic process not to mention the means by which most politicians get elected i was amused at the sub plots and found the film to be very fast paced and entertaining without any of the usual oh brother s i would agree the film is less comedy than marketed however without question better than 90 of the garbage in theatres at present just my thoughts don,1
5691,it must be a long time ago that i have seen such a bad movie i have to say it is really hard to make a good and or realistic movie about air disaster but this movie was such a waste of time and money also i think this is an unofficial way trying to get a bad reputation on airbus first the cockpit look a lot like an airbus cockpit second you got a stick third using computers to control rudders elevators aileron via fly by wire when i saw this movie i thought like the intention of the film was don t fly with computerized airplanes like airbus use boeing instead they have a direct connection of steering and rudders all i can say bad story horrible acting most of the actors worst film trick ever,0
1365,what a sucky movie this is without a doubt a low class b movie the german elite stormtroopers assault russian bunkers en masse like an old ww1 battle the acting is mediocre the plot thin and threadlike it s hard sometimes to follow where it s going the action sequences are pretty worthless when it shows any except for the fact that they do use authentic equipment vehicles from ww2 this is in no way on the same level as saving pvt ryan or platoon lots of worthless attempts at character development which lead nowhere old theme good officer bad officer that s highly predictable even the action sequences look like a 12yr old kid set them up i could have directed better too bad this is the same guy that did das boot the boat because that was a dang good movie he must have partied too much after that success because he sure lost his touch when it came to this film i bought it on dvd better to rent it instead,0
13461,big fat liar is the best movie ever it is funny and cool jason shepherd frankie muniz proves that he was not lying and goes to los angeles to get his paper back from marty wolf paul giamatti along with friend kaylee amanda bynes mess up his life since marty won t call jasons dad and say he wrote the paper yet it all turns out good and is a good movie to watch,1
23118,i ve taken another look at this film and still consider it pretty good chloe is one of the few hardcore stars who really can act she appears occasionally in soft core such as body of love and lady chatterly s stories on showtime i thought nicole hilbig did ok too with her nice body and charming accent too bad she s not in more films,1
2560,i m new to argento s work and if this and suspiria are any indication then argento is much more a filmmaker of experience than story in his films characters are placed in grueling and mesmerizing horror contexts that literally saturate the logic of the world around them the camera literally flows gracefully through sets as the characters run stumble and choke their way to an eventual horrifying conclusion it worked really well in suspiria for some reason it didn t work here the problem i see with this movie is that even though the protagonist gets help by way of contacting the police and asking for help from her friends it still feels as if she refuses to get help in terms of actually trying to find a solution to her problem the entrapment in this film is that she s trapped in the killer s little game one that she could easily get out of by not setting herself up so easily in a weird way it seems like the character wants the torture the killer gives her which in a way is the point and could have worked except that the whole psychology of it is thrown about mostly due to whatever argento feels like doing as a loving homage to the phantom of the opera it s certainly an interesting and unique take for all his worth argento delights in operatic movements as well which well highlights the action it just doesn t make much sense especially as it delves further into a completely useless ending yes i know it s a reference to harris novel red dragon no it didn t work why the character should go from one horrifying experience of entrapment to a willing one with the director is beyond me it felt almost self serving on argento s part overall a fun experience and between this and suspiria i m more than willing to follow up on more argento productions but this is not a movie i d want to return to or remember polarisdib,0
7035,some spoilers prc quickie that has j carrol naish playing dr igor markoff who s not really dr karkoff but an impostor who took over his identity back in europe the real dr karkoff had a affair with dr markoff s wife that lead to him to murder the real dr markoff and then having his wife lenore infected with acromegaly that made her look like the elephant man s sister this was done so that no one would ever want to look at her and he could keep lenore all to himself but the disturbed lenore later got even with her insane husband by killing herself this nut the fake dr markoff then spots patricia lawrence wanda mckay one evening at the theater where her father tony lawernce ralph morgan a world famous pianist is giving a concert enchanted by the lovely patricia who s a dead ringer for his dead wife lenore dr markoff becomes obsessed with her and goes to extreme lengths to marry her even though she s want s nothing to do with him after getting ridicules in his efforts to get patricia to fall in love with him by sending her flowers with syrupy love notes attached to then as much as five times a day tony goes to see the crazed dr mankoff to tell him to stop annoying his daughter it s then that tony ends up getting knocked out by the good doctor who has him injected with a dose of acromegaly that turns him into a somewhat unsightly fellow with his hands and body swelling up and not being able to play his beloved piano tony is told by his doctor dr adams sam flint that the only one who can cure him of that dreadful disease is non other then dr markoff the person who gave it to him the movie has the usual sub plots with dr markoff s assistant maxine tala birell who s also in love with him jealous of the phony doctor making a play for patricia there s also dr markoff s hulking butler glenn strange who like his pet gorilla is just a big clumsy oaf who can t even subdue maxine who s less the half the size strange ends up getting bopped on the head and knocked out cold by patricia s boyfriend bobby blake terry frost as for the gorilla he turns out to be but a big hairy wimp when he also tries to do in maxine and is chased away and locks himself back up in his cage by the pet dog ace dr markoff in his desperation to get patricia to marry him promises her to cure her dad only to have her father break out of his chains and in the ensuing struggle with him ends up shooting markoff dead with his own gun there is a happy ending to this whole mess with maxine who knew as much about markoff s cure for acromegaly as he did injecting tony with a secret serum that made him as good as new the movie ends like it started with tony playing the piano to a packed and cheering house at the local theater,0
8162,highly flawed but just about watchable comedy that runs like a farrelly brothers reject the most criminal thing about it though is the casting i couldn t for one minute believe jerry o connell and jake busey in the role of superstuds who could pull any woman at the drop of a hat nor could i believe the very beautiful shannon elizabeth as a streetwise tough cop story is predictable but does manage to raise a titter on a few occasions although the gross out meant to be shock comic scenes one involving an amputated testicle and another set in a sperm bank are just plain awful if this film is on tv then its probably worth watching if you are extremely bored but please don t waste your money renting it,0
21119,what a great movie this was is it heaven hell or something in between i disagree with many reviews of this movie saying that this is a depiction of hell it is not even clear if the opening scene starts the movie or is a flashback from the end further it is not clear that the main character goes to hell but perhaps someplace in between the review i read on imdb says this is hell but i disagree whole heartedly take into consideration that perhaps good people who commit suicide may not be condemned to hell this only one religious belief this is indeed a thinker and i have would recommend it to anyone who likes that type of movie definitely worth it,1
8322,warning i advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment if you plan on watching this movie don t i warn you this movie is terribly boring and basically horrifying not in the horror movie kind of way to watch i mistook this piranha movie for another piranha movie and when i had noticed i made a mistake i decided to watch this one anyway i wish i wouldn t have this movie is so horrendous and so intolerable in every piece of material that i couldn t bare to let anyone say this movie was halfway decent for one thing this movie should be called a boring talk about wilderness instead of piranha they only show piranhas once at the same time the way this film sounds so poorly heard i got sleepy only 20 minutes into the thing at the end my mouth was hung wide open and i stared gloomily at the blank tv screen it is a very poorly directed and badly filmed piece of junk that i was afraid i brain dysfunction after watching it,0
8529,what the hell is this movie about well if i didn t know that son of the mask is categorized as comedy i would never have a clue a comedy a tragedy that s the right genre for this yet another so called sequel yes i ve watched dumb and dumber but i never believed somebody will ever make it s title real in hollywood yes you watch son of the mask and you think 5 minutes dumb 10 minutes dumber 15 minutes dumbest and then after 16 minutes there is only one thing to say i m out of here sorry my nominee for comedy crap of the year 2005,0
7125,am not from america i usually watch this show on axn channel i don t know why this respected channel air such sucking program in prime time slot creation of hollywood s money bank jerry bruckheimer this time he is spending a big load of cash in the small screen in each episode a bunch of peoples having two team members travels from on country to another for a great sum of money where the camera crews shoot their travels i don t know who the hell gave this stupid idea for the show it has nothing to watch for in all episodes we see people ran like beggars some times shouting crying beeping jerky camera works huh it s harmful to both eyes and ears the most disgusting part in the race is the viewers finally knows each of the team members can t enjoy their race traveling experience even though to add up the ratings the producers came up with the ideas of including gays in one shows sucking american reality show it s nothing to watch for better switch to another channels the amazing race the disgusting show,0

14244,if as i just pointed out in the goat keaton is following the tradition of the comics finding themselves at odds with the law this langdon short the last released before he did tramp tramp tramp was based on another comic ploy being married to a shrewish spouse and trying to get away for some secret two timing dating laurel hardy did this in several films as did fields and chaplin i have a problem with it why do these characters always marry such nasty women and there is an interesting sociological side issue why don t you find female comics married to male counterparts to these shrews i can t recall any except in a carol burnett skit where the two nastier members of two couples discover that they prefer having someone give it back as good as they get a kind of mutual sado masochism but also reassurance that their not married to a namby pamby type as for the fact that the comics do marry shrews i suppose one can imagine they get what they deserve or do they ollie really deserves a wife who throws pots and dishes at him yeah he went to that convention in sons of the desert that ruined her plans but he wanted to get some private time there is nothing suggesting he and stan cheated on their wives actually he is creamed by mae busch because he lied to her while stan collapsed and told the truth to his wife here harry s wife alice ward is shown at the start talking to her mother about how she keeps him under strict control we see harry at his job it is saturday morning and the job ends at noon for the rest of the weekend this was before the idea of a five day a week 40 hour a week job in industry he works in a foundry where he hits red hot metal into shape an early joke about langdon he is a small light man not the muscular type to swing a sledge hammer he just misses his streetcar trying to give a man a light he calls home to explain things and gets an earful from the missus for being two minutes late on the way home harry meets his pal steve vernon dent who has met two nice sweet girls who would just love to have a date harry is hesitant but agrees to it after talking to the girl he agrees to pay for the hot dogs for the foursome he has a 1926 silver half dollar in his pocket but his plans seem derailed when his wife discovers his hidden cache of coins he keeps it hidden under the living room rug and finds it by walking along the edge of the rug but his wife spies on him and confiscates all of it later she overhears him talking to himself and berating her in contempt she gives him back a dime and says he can treat his date to a soda but harry has a second cache of coins and dresses up for the date and goes out he and dent are apparently late and dent blames harry but harry tries to make it up to him he produces two prostitutes they get into a quarrel when dent wisely says they are not the type of girls he d term as nice eventually the girls do show up and the date begins but soon harry is hiding in the rumble seat as his wife drives past in her roadster and the girls boy friends turn up angry at their two rivals the short works well and is amusing and gives one a better idea of the persona that harry langdon developed in his brief stardom as a comic master he is constantly put upon by others he misses his streetcar because some stranger keeps asking for a smoke and a light and in the end the stranger gets his own the nice girl who is harry s date has a little dog who chases him away he rests between two cars that both start driving away and he ends up wrapped around a pole it certainly demonstrates that langdon had his screen persona down pat by the time that he made his features if only he could have kept the complex whole together beyond those three first features,1
14332,man with the screaming brain certainly isn t a perfect movie but i m pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for bruce campbell meaning it works as kind of a summary of his entire career slapstick sarcasm cheese action and happy endings campbell is as a writer uneven there are lots of things in the story that don t make a great deal of sense why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other better incarnations the scene in the restaurant where yegor and william battle for control of william s body is straight out of evil dead ii there are however lots of little touches and non sequiturs that feel rather brilliant such as when william is in the height of his panic and screams at a statue what are you looking at the movie looks like a sci fi channel original probably because it was the acting is actually pretty good i particularly enjoyed tamara gorski as tatoya she was ruthless and cunning yes but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored ted raimi handled the standard bumbling assistant role admirably enough and bruce is funny as the arrogant sardonic condescending american jerk now that he s writing his own films you d think he d give himself a role that he hasn t been typecast in already man with the screaming brain is a bizarre nonsensical b movie that ought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid taking a cinematic experience too seriously,1
3735,saying this movie is worse than asphyxiating on your own diarrhea is a generous understatement the only thing more pathetic than this reprehensible piece of garbage of a movie is the shmuck getting paid by the producers to register a bunch of accounts to post fake appraise if watching a poorly acted suspenseless snoozer of a movie about sloth from the goonies kill people in a fashion that completely ignores every law of physics pulling on an unrestrained person s legs causing them to be ripped from the torso is your idea of a good movie then knock yourself out no carbon based lifeform with a functioning occipital lobe would consider in a million eons that this movie is scary or entertaining,0
2000,yes in this movie you are treated to multiple little snowmen on the attack in apparently a very warm climate so yes this movie is definitely not to be taken seriously it is in fact a much worse movie than the original as at least with that one the whole production looked like it cost more than a couple of bucks and a video camera to make it has its funny moments but really playing off the cheapness of your movie and making that be your intended laughs is kind of weak film making if you ask me you can not come up with a good story your effects are going to really be bad hey let us just make the movie look as bad as possible with horrible one liners and we have our movie the first one at least had a somewhat credible story as the snowman in that one attacked during the winter and not what amounts to a resort it also had better effects too this one is just a step or two ahead of hobgoblins as far as the monsters are concerned and you really want to be more than a step a two above a bunch of hand puppets still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost actually i am just kidding but really it was the funniest part of the movie,0
24910,i agree with johnlewis who said that there is a lot going on between the lines in this film while i do think the pacing of this film could be improved i do think that the complexity of the relationships between the characters is fascinating examples pierre is going to marry his cousin even though his love for her seems very cousin y pierre and his stepmother have a rather curious relationship pierre lucie and thibault seem to have a triangular relationship and the actual points to the triangle are not quite certain lucie s brother is a bit of a eunuch or is he and isabelle who is she really overall i think it was worth my time an interesting film and one that makes me want to read melville,1
23181,this is an action packed film that makes me feel very peaceful and relaxed every time i see it the film short of its conclusion demonstrates that in the face of extreme odds it is still possible to prevail this film is very refreshing and likely to be banned at any moment get a copy of it before the thought police burn every copy they can find they don t want you to have hope for the future or to think you have a chance on the other hand should political correctness fail to supress it this would be an excellent movie to release on dvd such a release could contain interviews with the writer and director and related goodies i m sure it would sell some copies and i would be one of the first to buy it mincka,1
8258,enormous suspension of disbelief is required where will s genius is concerned not just in math he is also very well read in economic history able to out shrink several shrinks etc etc no no no i don t buy it while they re at it they might as well have him wearing a big s on his chest flying faster than a jet plane and stopping bullets among other problems real genius shelving for the moment the problem of what it really is and whether it deserves such mindless homage doesn t simply appear ex nihilo it isn t ever so multi faceted and it is very rarely appreciated by contemporaries better to have made will a basketball prodigy except that damon s too short,0
18625,after repeatedly saying how brilliant so many columbo episodes are it s time to honour an episode with maximum points etude in black is not 100 percent perfect but it s certainly more than 90 percent maybe 96 or 97 last week i reviewed just married and compared it unfavourably to meet the parents well here s one of the parents blythe danner in a much earlier role as the wife of famous orchestral conductor alex benedict played by the legend that is john cassavetes alex has been having an affair with jennifer wells a girl in the orchestra not his first affair one suspects she is blackmailing alex to leave his wife but as his wife s mother holds the purse strings for the orchestra alex doesn t think it d be such a smart move to destroy his career and marriage overnight instead he hatches a plot to sneak out of the concert hall before a performance and murder his young lover while making it look like a suicide enter columbo and guess what it takes him about two seconds to realise that homicide is more likely than suicide it doesn t take much longer for columbo to connect alex to the victim and soon he s following him around wherever he goes even though columbo is certain alex is his man it actually takes quite a while and a few false leads none of which columbo really swallows before he has the vital piece of evidence along the way there are some top notch extra characters ranging from the precocious young neighbour of jennifer wells and the english mechanic who sounds like he would be more at home on coronation street through to the bedraggled looking brass player who nearly finds himself fitted up for the murder he had also been seeing jennifer wells the busy girl and there s even a brief cameo from commandant lassard from the police academy films as with leslie nielsen in lady in waiting it s impossible to take him seriously i bet you re thinking of that speech he made at the podium aren t you but it s blythe danner john cassavetes and peter falk who steal the show here blythe is absolutely divine as mrs benedict from the moment she spots alex dialling jennifer wells number from memory she feels deeply troubled by exactly what their relationship was it s a masterful performance as she struggles to trust alex despite her intuition telling her something is very very wrong columbo doesn t help matters by interrupting her game of tennis to ask her impertinent questions about alex s relations with members of his orchestra as for john cassavetes well it s a shame he didn t make any repeat appearances as columbo villains because he could have been up there with jack cassidy and patrick mcgoohan as one of the all time greats of the show but this performance is superb he s another one who falls into the highly irritated category losing all patience with columbo rather than befriending him and indulging him despite this when the game is finally up he does grudgingly acknowledge columbo s genius well it s a really really fantastic show it loses a couple of very small points for its rather sledgehammer view of classical music as highlighted by many of the posters here but none of these have any bearing on the logic of the story or the characterisations and at least the music is good dramatic and exciting finally if you haven t come across it there is an absolutely amazing clip of john cassavetes and peter falk on the dick cavett show from the early 70s i m totally convinced steve coogan watched this clip and based alan partridge on it everything about the clip resembles knowing me knowing you from the cringeworthy introduction to the total humiliation of cavett by his guests even the orchestra get in on the act playing circus music while falk cassavetes and their friend ben gazzara fool about and ridicule the host it might not be strictly relevant to this review but the cavett show clip gives a nice insight into the deep friendship and professional relationship between peter falk and john cassavetes it s clear to see from the quality of etude in black just how well the pair worked together,1
23466,howard brackett kevin kline is a teacher who is about to get married then one of his former students wins an oscar for a film in which he plays a gay soldier and thanks howard in his acceptance speech outing him as being gay too this film follows the aftermath as reporters descend on howard s village and he tries to convince everyone that he is straight i love this movie kevin kline is wonderful it has some really hilarious moments and it always leaves me feeling great with an enormous grin on my face consequently it s one film that i enjoy watching as often as possible if you haven t seen it you re missing out,1
15757,jimmy heath ledger is given a simple job by pando bryan brown a underworld kingpin to deliver money to a particular address but when no one answers the door jimmy decides to take a dip at the beach to pass some time but he notices that his clothes on the sand have been messed up and the 10 grand is gone jimmy rings pando to tell him the problem but he doesn t want to hear it pando and his boys try their best to locate jimmy meaning no more jimmy if they get their hands on him so now jimmy goes into hiding to organise a bank robbery to get pando s money back also throughout this mess he meets the innocently sweet alex rose byrne and together they re in for one hell of a ride through sydney s king cross two hands is simply an engrossing pick me up film that s brisk exhilarating and incredibly fresh what you got here is pretty much an urban gangster film with a seedy backdrop and in your face violence what how s that fresh you ask well because it takes us into the underworld where the australian culture shines with criminals wearing thongs flip flops and footy shorts done up cars and a can of beer in the hand and don t forgot the australian sense of humour dry and sarcastic you can say it owes a lot to the likes of pulp fiction goodfellas a fave of mine and lock stock and two smoking barrels for its inspiration but for me it still stands on its own the film has real mixture of light hearted moments but also a mean streak to it with some unexpected shocks and black humour that can actually be disturbing you just don t know what s coming and it has a nice touch of snappy irony especially the ending and great timing with its humour one scene involving a bank robbery will have you in stitches i guarantee you the plot s outline is really a coming to age story or about the road not taken with a punching love tale added and then the gangster element to finish it off most of the sub plots were cleverly constructed and interlocked well maybe it could ve gone without the supernatural element involving jimmy s dead brother but in the overall context the diverse plot seems to all click together intense natural and crisp dialogue filled the outrageously colourful script with quick jabs of aussie slang twang i m fair dinkum what truly made the film was that of bryan brown s performance of pando he just gave his character such a deviously charismatic nasty persona that when he wasn t on screen his presence was still felt he gave his character two sides one being a prick but the other side is such a good bloke a young rose byrne glows with her nervously sweet quirky character alex she looked radially gorgeous and added a bubbly personality then you got heath ledger who fit s the buck as the naive jimmy great supporting cast involved with the likes of susie porter tom long david field steve vidler and steve le marquand such raw performances are achieved and from that you get riveting fun and believable characters pumping rock soundtrack bursting at the seams with the likes of powderfinger and alex lloyd provide a cool vibe also being shot on location in sydney s king cross really helped it stick out by holding a life of its own and showing the australian way of life gliding camera tricks captured the city s backdrop superbly especially the piercing nightlife this was a film that when it ended i was totally satisfied with what i got overall a slickly paced crime thriller that achieves what it intended to do a fun clever and crazy roller coaster ride of thrills and excitement i say it s a successful aussie take on lock stock and two smoking barrels by director writer gregor jordan in his debut film if you come across it don t hesitate to it give it a go,1
7449,h g wells is spinning no doubt about it really this would have been a decent sci fi adventure movie if it hadn t been based on a classic novel and directed by the author s grandson i kept hearing about how this would be the definitive version of the novel what resulted was a pathetic and simpleminded bastardization the novel is a great sci fi story but what a lot of people miss when they read it probably because they read it when they re very young is that it s overflowing with social commentary the eloi and morlocks are a satire of the class distinctions of victorian england and the overall message of the film is that everything decays and degenerates a satiric jab at victorian complacency and their belief that their civilization would last forever there s no love story no romance with a beautiful eloi woman in the novel the eloi are 3 foot tall childlike beings with a mental capacity not far above that of an animal the time traveler does befriend an eloi woman but it s clear he thinks of her more like a pet and anyway she s killed before the novel ends this movie first tries to give us a totally stupid backstory as to why he wants to travel through time the treacly romance and the lessons he must learn are enough to make film fans vomit the journey into the future is punctuated by a future disaster ok not bad but it would have had more punch if we had been allowed to see that mankind just generally degenerates as in the book more a reflection of the times i guess as the george pal version had a nuclear war take place the general story ugh a total misrepresentation of the novel the eloi are too competent and warlike the morlocks are too intelligent the ubermorlock is an embarrassment and there s no setup he just shows up in time to be killed yawn samantha mumba does ok guy pearce is one of my favorites but he often seems confused and in pain reportedly he broke a rib while filming this he also looks unhealthy and overly thin as if he had been ill for a long time before making this a sad sorry film version of one of the world s classics h g wells deserves better much better,0
9064,carolina moon is an adequate made for tv movie about a girl with psychic powers who returns to the town whereshe grew up in and where her childhood best friend was murdered turns out that every year on the same date anotheryoung girl is murdered and tori played by claire forlani must solve the mystery before she ends up dead claire forlani meet joe black csi new york is the female lead and does a pretty good job of it ably supported by the rather delicious oliver hudsom and a still luminous jacqueline bisset the script adapted from a nora roberts novel is bog standard and the plotis tediously predictable that however is offset again by like i said the rather delicious oliver hudson,0
12129,idiots go camping and act like idiots before they finally die like idiots yes camp blood or if you re wanting an awful badder than bad pun that suits a badder than bad film camp bloody awful is so bad it s actually quite depressing to watch and it has all the ingredients to be a perfectly bad film awful acting check bad script check tacky effects check no originality whatsoever double check it doesn t even attempt to be different and is riddled with every predicted clich imaginable for example the film opens to a couple having sex in the woods so of course they end up dead one of the most disturbing things is that this film actually spawned two sequels how and why only baffles the mind just stay away from this one,0
13997,frank sinatra has one of his best roles as a reformed heroin addict coming back to his chicago neighborhood after an extensive stay in a clinic he plans to stay off the drug and find work as a drummer but he can t avoid running into his old friends he had been arrested originally not for any drug related charge but because he was caught dealing in an illegal poker game his skill at poker has earned him the nickname of the man with the golden arm and the men who run the game one of them being his former heroin connection want him to deal again meanwhile frank has to take care of a woman whom he injured in a car accident zosch eleanor parker and make up with his old girlfriend molly kim novak the film is great at putting us in sinatra s mental state when he feels sure of himself at the beginning of the film i felt good for him but when a promised phone call doesn t come one day he descends into depression and goes back on the smack later when he finally gets to audition he arrives completely strung out his embarrassment when he can t play the correct beat is devastating he had such big dreams and the other musicians don t even pay him a bit of attention as he rushes out of the room the film moves quickly and it shows frank s drug problem in a realistic light without turning into a social message picture the actors are uniformly fine elmer bernstein s score is one of the best of its time the only thing i don t like about the film is the ending spoilersalthough i really like the character of zosch and parker is very good in the film they could have done a little more to fill in her backstory the ending is a little too pat while there is surely pathos that will remain with the characters after the film closes zosch s death ties up all the loose ends a bit too neatly frank is free to love molly and he won t go to jail also his dealer is dead so at least the immediate threat is gone well i guess in hollywood there s always a desire to tie everything up in a neat little package it harms the film a little but as it stands it s still one of the best and most adult movies about drug addiction i can think of 9 10,1
9708,the old man mouse in this cartoon would have you believe that all men are created equally evil so if we have to kill men in order to stop hitler we are just as bad as hitler was killing the jews well i don t buy it mr mouse but i guess it paints a pretty picture and makes a cute cartoon but it wasn t the reality then and it ain t reality now,0
24306,i must admit i liked this movie and didnt find it all misogynist it could be subtitled three ways of looking at liv tyler three different men become obsessed with the same woman and tell their stories to very different characters one man john goodman tells his story to a priest the very funny richard jenkins for goodmans charcter the liv tyler character is an idealized saint the second coming of his sainted wife theresa for paul riesers character who tellls story to a shrink a fine understated performance by the great reba mcintire the liv tyler character is simplyan object of kinky sexual fantasy finally matt dillons rather dimwitted charcter tells his side of the story to a sleazy hit man played by micheal douglas all three of these narratives of obsession are told simultaneously and all are amusing finaly the film ends in a bizarrely funny climax that i wont give away,1
24049,finally watched this shocking movie last night and what a disturbing mindf ker it is and unbelievably bloody and some unforgettable scenes and a total assault on the senses looks like a movie from the minds of lynch specifically eraserhead buttgereit and even a little of begotten what this guy does to his pregnant sister is beyond belief but then again did it really happen or is it his brain s left and right sides doing battle that s the main theme of this piece of art to draw a fine line between fantasy and reality and what would happen if the right side of the brain that dreams and fantasizes overtakes the reasoning and logical left side and the music in this movie is unbelievable a kind of electronic score that is absolutely perfect even though this movie is totally shocking and pretty disgusting in some of the most extreme scenes including hard core sex you will ever see in any movie i viewed it as a work of art and loved it and that music still amazes me i have to try and find the soundtrack if is available watching subconscious cruelty is a real event and not something the viewer will easily forget and a note to gorehounds this is a must have warning be careful buying this movie because some prints have fogging on the graphic sex scenes and extreme gore especially the copies from the japanese release,1
3925,i was all in awe of the film looking at the promos and went to watch it fdfs the film was horrible to say the leastthe first scene is good and till they go to london things are funny but slowly the pace slackens and they is nothing funny about itthe manoj joshi subplot is funny at places but is unwanted and adds to the boredomthe drugs part is funny especially the monologue of govindathe film goes on and on aimlessly just like a small kid has written itthe interval brings a twist in the story but by then i lost hopethe second half starts okay but the way things are handled makes a mockery the entire arbaaz jackie angle is half baked also how come people don t identify them the climax is quite funny though stupidpriyadarshan is not at all in his elements from this film he started doing craps and his films got bad and bad music is good signal tere bin stand out and afreen too camera work is goodakshay kumar has white in his stubble and looks old but he acts well though this role he has done many times yet thanks to his natural comedy acting things look bearable govinda looks out of shape bad and his act except monologue is boring too surprising from govinda seems too much pressure on him to comeback and priyan fails to utilize him paresh is okay in parts but overall just repeat act manoj joshi is funny at places sharat saxena is okay shakti kapoor is great jackie shroff looks overweight and acts in his sleep arbaaz khan is bad lara dutta shrieks to glory but fails to act,0
2327,during my struggle to stay awake during this borefest i fought through my near dosing off to discover some silly plot regarding fraternity schmucks quite incredibly obnoxiously annoying running into trouble with a psychotic radioactively damaged half human half cyborg named splatter who sends his soldiers after them for the murder of their prestigious politically vocal leader for whom splatter killed himself setting them up to take the blame so he could become the leader these face painted freaks form a group who express their feelings anarchically though non violently living on dilapidated streets abandoned by the civilized world voicing their concerns regarding nuclear disarmament anyways most of the film has these five frat goons running throughout darkened streets with graffiti walls as splatter and his punks pursue them thankfully for these guys they find a punk chic to assist them on their journey out of this rather ugly terrain with which they re unfamiliarized this territory the frat guys are immersed is a veritable labyrinth of streets and alleys with the idea of an exit out most difficult particularly when crazies and splatter s bunch occupy nearly every turn yeah i was duped like others thanks to the hr giger poster which is most excellent if only he had been the designer of this dreck this is not the case and we the viewer are left a film modeled after of all movies it seems walter hill s the warriors except this film doesn t have the style or grit that film has the film has a plethora of unfunny bits and lame confrontations between the frats and the punks with hand to hand combats often laughable the setting is rather interesting and there are some atmospheric uses of neon light but it s not the environment that s the problem it s the plot and characters within the environment that grow tiresome the saddlebags under my eyes weighed heavier every minute this movie continued yes texas chainsaw stars edwin neal quite a funny voice man who has an entertaining interview on the dvd i rented for this flaming turd of a film and marilyn burns have key roles as opposing members of their faction against the government resulting in the final conclusion within a building complex at the end neal s character splatter uses these metal spikes which emerge from his metal arm to kill his victims,0
21236,human traffic is without a doubt the most original and compelling film that i have seen for a long time it documents 2 days in the lives of a group of young people bored with their everyday existence and dead end jobs and taking ecstasy at raves on the weekend it is hilariously funny and extremely poignant and at times very sad in the same genre as trainspotting it has a great soundtrack and features hot young rising british stars the movie was made on a miniscule budget and i look forward to future offerings of writer director justin kerrigan when his talent is discovered by the major movie makers,1
1633,george and mildred was a spin off from the mid 1970s sit com man about the house though i haven t seen the series since it was last broadcast i do remember it being fairly amusing with most of the comedy arising from the eponymous couple going to live beside the snobbish fourmile family a sort of love thy neighbour without the cynical racist gags having seen this big screen version of the show i find myself asking what it s a big screen version of certainly not of a popular mid 70s sit com of the same name for some reason the movie jettisons all character interaction from the television by having george and mildred leaving the street where they live behind and getting caught up in a plot involving some serious gangsters who want something george has inadvertently picked up and which leads to some cringe making situations and lines like did he give it to you no that s the first time a man has resisted my charms i meant the envelope you do get the impression that screenwriter dick sharples who never wrote an episode for the original sit com has never seen an episode of the source material and has got the show confused with the carry on series of films in many ways it resembles the same mistakes of the latter lost in space movie in that it has absolutely nothing in common with the series that spawned it,0
15098,dear readers 2001 a space odyssey is kubrick at his best although i really can t say that as space odyssey is his only film i ve ever watched but still it s a good film strange but good the movie is in three acts much like the novel which is unsurprising since the author wrote the screenplay anyhow we first start out with the simple yet spectacular opening with also sparach zarathustra blaring on the speakers then comes the boring beyond belief dawn of man sequence then there s the odd finding of the monolith sequence on the moon played to strauss s blue danube finally things get good with the spaceship scenes and hal going berserk and killing people after that things die down and we have the entering the monolith sequence which was way too long and the ultra strange ending even though 2001 a space odyssey is a good film it s not star wars stargate terminator or the abyss but it rocks my compliments to the chef mr kubrick signed the constant dvd collector,1
8338,disappointing is the best word i could think for this film especially considering the glowing reviews it receives from some other users one thing that really spoils the film is that it is unabashedly partial in both senses of the word not only does it present a very selective description of the games focussing as it does on the us athletics team but it also contains several inaccuracies most of which serve to exaggerate the difficulties the us team faced what is even more disturbing is that all the omissions and mistakes appear to glorify us sportsmanship to the exclusion of other athletes with a few celebrated exceptions for example the viewer is led to believe that the us won the majority of medals in the games when in fact they won only one out of four gold medals and one out of 6 total similarly many athletes are portrayed as caricatures of their respective countrymen thus we have an arrogant brit and a wine swilling french this attitude does very little service to the olympic ideals that the film is supposed to celebrate in conclusion i believe that this film would appeal to that part of the us audience that is looking for a quick boost of national self esteem those looking for a detailed and historically correct description of the games are advised to look elsewhere,0
7526,the first robocop had a sense of cynical wit and a sick sense of violence it was a fine line to walk but paul verhoeven pulled it off and the film did so well they made a sequel how awful possible spoilers ahead though anything that could spoil this is beyond me irvin kershner is not the director for this type of film he clearly did not understand the wit of the original and as a result the massive over the top senseless violence looks really bad and worse is very distasteful even worse is the musical score leonard rosenman was an old man from another era and the heroic light music does not match the images on the screen at all what was he scoring the great american hero worst of all he completely eliminated robocop s theme from the first film which was so memorable and perfect can you imagine a superman film without john williams fanfare or indiana jones etc how could he do that the plot is just a collection of ideas that don t gel in beginning we see robo stalking his old wife fine good idea but they completely drop it after that then there is this a stupid idea of the company reprogramming robo to be nice that s thrown in for 10 minutes and then is immediately dropped or the silly idea that the repulsive 10 year old drug lord reminds robo of his son once again a weak motif that is shown briefly twice and dropped this may work in a comic book but not on film and frank miller was unfortunately too inexperienced at the time and threw every idea in along with the kitchen sink it doesn t work as a whole some people here seem to be praising the corporate bashing in this film and the privatization of the police that is the best part of the film that is consistent with the first however in the original the old man was a tough business man out for a profit but ultimately fair in the end in this film he is just pure evil in his lust for money and power you can t just change characters like that for no reason and nancy allen s character is useless in this film whereas in the first she was essential to robo s search for himself she is as gratuitous as the violence in this film and the violence yes the violence i enjoy many violent bloody films when they serve purposes and are meant to tell a story irvin kershner seems to get off on human beings being blown to bits shot to pieces children lusting for death and torture and peoples desire for drugs he doesn t know when to stop do we really need to see every last innocent bystander even people trying to help others get shot up it is inferred when we see the bad robocop shooting repeatedly instead mr kershner proves he has very little taste for this type of work and creates an abominable mess that is a terrible piece of pop art and worse a disgusting message of violence for any young person watching this film no this film isn t meant to be message y and i certainly don t watch robocop movies or alien or predator movies for that reason however when you go too far and cross the line much of what you do must be put into question and as for this film in the words of the evil kid drug dealer s last words as he dies it still sucks,0
4820,i have to say that this movie was not what i expected even though i have not read the book the fact that plants can one bait and then wait for a killing to happen only to have it drag off a corpse for lunch is about the worst scenario anyone has come up with with the title ruins you would think that out of 3000 years that some kind of deity or ancient animal or god would be the culprit this is like another movie primeval where you would think it was something strange that villagers fear the most but not a crocodile either way this film was like that it entices you to think about ruins of mayan or inca folklore resulting in awakening and old god or the people had another agenda for sacrifice or something to that effect but plants come on is there nothing else producers can come up with to wow a crowd as for this movie it will hit the b list in no time i have to say that some of the gore was excellent to see but it didn t make up for the rest of the film and a plant mimicking a cell phone sound or peoples voices is just too much to be believed i am a fan of horror films but i am not a stereo typed fan who relies on just gore or mechanical effects i do rely on great suspense and whats the next scene going to bring for more suspense the thing had a better story line than this did even the ring had me jumping for more but the ruins is just that ruined for using a plant to coax victims into killing or be killed by the villagers the premise was alright for the villagers to keep it at bay with salt and such but still a simple blow torch and lots of napalm can easily do the trick to end those pesky plants with a flesh eating disorder,0
14358,when i saw the trailer for this film i said out loud to no one in particular this film is going to bomb i also said that about the matrix and look at what happened there now i am not a box office guru by any stretch but i usually have a pretty good gut about what is going to be good and what is going to really suck in this case i was blinded by my complete and utter apathy towards david duchovney let me put it to you a different way i don t like his as a person from what i have read of him in interviews he is unbelievably pre madonna like and he is full of himself considering all he has done is x files or as an actor playing god was a really poor film but he came off thinking that for some reason he deserved big bucks on the big screen but i am happy to say that even though those things may still be true about the man return to me is delightful and has it s heart in the right place bonnie hunt has directed a beautiful story and she has told it with class and grace this is one of the most romantic films i have seen and even though it may seem to be a bit sad and maudlin in its premise give it a chance and you will be hooked it has to be said and this pains me to do so that the reason this film works so well is because of the story and the cast duchovney and driver are so wonderful and believable here that i honestly wanted to cry along with them there is one particularly powerful scene when duchovney comes home after his wife has died and he slumps down on the floor of his house as it always does the family dog looks to the door to wait for his wife to come walking in she doesn t and with his shirt collar still stained with blood rob duchovney tells him that she is not coming home ever he then calls the dog over to him and they seem to share a cry together the dog lets out a small moan and then rob cries and this is one of the most realistic moments of pain i have ever seen in any character in any movie you can feel his pain and at that moment i forgot i was watching an actor that i generally don t like and i felt that i was watching someone that i knew moarn the loss of his beloved this is powerful stuff another strength of the film is the supporting cast bonnie hunt has combined an ethnic melting pot of irish and italian characters that share a common bond they share a pub called o reilley s italian pub that is a delicious name all by itself and heading the diametric scale of clashing cultures is carol o connor and robert loggia these are two proud old men that love their homeland but love their granddaughter and niece i think it is respectively and that is the character played by minnie driver this scenario is ripe for comedy and hunt doesn t miss anything here bonnie hunt and james belushi also share some funny moments together as the middle aged married couple and belushi gets top points as he accepts humility gracefully and shows off his ample keg of a stomach for laughs with his family consisting of three or four kids there is very little time for him and the wife to have quality time and again hunt handles this with perfect elegance this is a wonderful story of finding true love knowing how lucky you are to have true love and the power of friendship and family return to me is a wonderful romance and even though i still don t have a great admiration for david duchovney i have to admit that he was perfect in this role and i could not picture anyone else playing his character he was sensitive and believable and the movie was good because of him not just because of him but he sure added to the flavour if you are a sucker for a good romance and you want a good cry then this is the film for you 8 5 out of 10 i will see anything that bonnie hunt puts out with her in the director s chair,1
24138,if i look hard enough flaws can be found in this film primarily with the script i found the character of wolf not totally convincing however those were my only complaints because when this movie started on cable i was just going to record it and watch it later however from the beginning with the eerie music and cameron diaz doing her spaced out 60 s dance i was riveted i never got up until the movie was over it seemed like i never even blinked the acting of cameron diaz and jordana brewster was excellent the scenes were beautiful the girls were beautiful and the music was haunting and very touching the story was quite unique and at times had a surreal quality the viewer would tend to like the picture more if they had a good understanding of the state of mind of young people in the 60 s and 70 s especially in america many of the scenes basically succeeded in showing something of that era that is hard to pin down it was a bit more complicated than the simplistic statement that they wanted to change the world and ended up disillusioned although that may be the most obvious aspect phoebe learns more and more about this as the movie progresses one aspect that didn t seem to be covered by the other reviewers that might bear mentioning is the way the two daughters seem to drift through life after the death of their father they both had adored him and his presence had been a stabilizing factor in their lives and obviously he had loved them dearly we read so much today about boys who lose their fathers too soon only to lose their way themselves this film covers the ripple effect of the loss of the father on the daughters left behind first on the older sister faith then on to her younger sister their mother feels inadequate to try to be both parents this type of dynamic is not covered in hardly any other movies especially in so many different layers of plot and subplot phoebe s inner struggles of reality versus perceptions are gradually peeled away like layers of an onion speaking of plot this movie should rate higher than it has here i kept waiting for some great conspiracy to be found out concerning the death of faith how it did resolve itself surprised me even if others may have guessed much sooner maybe not for everybody but i could watch this movie many many times,1
5726,out of boredom and vast curiosity i decided to check this show out today since my four year old niece loves it i should have known that it was a show that only a four year old could like the show was pretty bad first of all the show just wasn t funny the laugh track went off at the most inappropriate times which was very annoying especially since none of the jokes were funny the laugh track went off at some point when the one kid who s the cameraman said i m going to go polish my lense how the hell is that funny the parts in it like meat drumming that were supposed to be funny was just stupid to anyone who s over the age of eleven now i have a feeling that four year olds are not the target audience however since i have a four year old niece who watches it this sort of thing concerned me while i was watching it it doesn t show very good behavior in the episode i was watching it shows sam stealing carly s sandwich and pushing her down to the ground just so carly can stand up and do the same thing back to her i would not want to see my niece acting that rude i also don t like the idea of two young girls having a web show where they give out personal information if this was real there would be freaks all over her this show would probably be good and funny to someone who s eleven or younger but anyone older than that just stay away from it i ll give this two stars since i guess i can see how it can be funny to a kid,0
1540,i rate movies on this site all the time but i don t normally write comments however in this case i felt compelled to warn others this movie is bad it s probably one of only a dozen movies i have scored as 1 awful i know people say this all the time but this truly was one of the worst movies i have ever seen it s easily on the bottom ten anyway when it comes to horror movies i have very low standards i ll overlook all sorts of shoddy film making for a good scare but this movie is embarrassingly bad it looks someone bought a video camera at sears and decided to make a movie with his buddies the fact that every single crew member s name appears in the cast list proves this theory i think this movie has lower production standards than your average high school play it s actually a little shocking to see a movie that looks this bad released on dvd the special effects are somewhat effective at times but are still amateurish at best the best thing that can be said about the actors is that at least they remember no to look into the camera most of the time i can t say for certain if they struggling to remember their lines or making them up as they went along any and all attempts at humor are lame this movie is such a colossal waste of time,0
4171,relesed from troma which is my favorite movie company unspeaksble is a messy horror film that can be interesting but very dark and twisted unspeakable starts with a family in a car they get into an accident which leaves a daughter dead and a mother deformed the father eventually goes crazy and slashes prostitutes he sees his daughter in other people he kills for her meanwhile his now deformed wife is being raped by her orderly these are sick people unspeakable tries to be sick and disturbing and it does manage to do that as a good horror flick this is not most troma movies have a sense of humor to them but however this one doesn t,0
2200,director screenwriter allan burns seems to have patched two different scripts together before coming up with this minor outing a comedy about infidelity and a melodrama about loss and sabotage it results in a wincingly unfunny film christine lahti plays a crass cynical tv news reporter who makes friends with aerobics instructor mary tyler moore and is soon having dinner with moore and her family only to discover mary s husband ted danson is lahti s secret affair burns has a strange stop and start rhythm to his dialogue which is neither realistic nor effective just increasingly annoying because nothing important ever seems to get said rail thin moore looking alarmingly frail in her leotard has a radiant smile but doesn t convince as danson s wife and danson gets stuck with a paltry thankless role he s just there to be a cad the movie attempts to cover all the bases in a classic case of overreaching woman s role in the workplace the tv news biz the cheating family man the working wife and mother who wants more a woman s need for female friendships et al but nothing substantial comes out of these ideas since burns only half heartedly examines the issues as a writer he is surprisingly free of punchlines but is devoid of a purpose as well and the heavy plotting just gets all fouled up 1 2 from,0
7939,first thing i note is the music it s nothing as amazing as ruggero deodato s cannibal holocaust s haunting theme or the masterpiece waltz from a tale of two sisters but i don t let that stop me so early in the film one must assume that the woman researching her hypothesis for her phd dissertation that cannibalism as a organized practice has never existed one would think they must take into the consideration that they are wrong and prepare for the trip accordingly right or why go at all if you already believe the hypothesis to be true before even being tested that s fairly unbelievably ignorant and makes the movie seem that much more unrealistic and badly scripted that actually is similar to the ruggero deodato s film just totally ill prepared no guns no decent hiking clothing just nonsense through and through people don t go on trips like this for college without months of planning and preparation but i digress things don t get off to a very good start for our brave yet stupid adventurers as they swerve to miss a jaywalking iguana and their decoy pet ferret falls out of the truck nearly to it s demise then to fall into a mud hole well i guess it s time to walk okay then they flip a coin to see whether they keep going or forget the whole thing how does that scene even make any sense all their conviction rests on the flip of a coin after they must ve spent time and money and preparation just getting out there this just keeps getting worse defiinitely some of the worst acting and scripting and music ever concocted for the film industry mike talks about how he and his friend s were captured by the cannibals and put into cages in mud pits with 3 inch long leeches sucking on their blood i found that interesting because if you remember the first cannibal they run into in the jungle a man they mistake as a simple native is sitting on the ground eating such leeches wonder if they are the same ones really though this movie is just terrible because the script is horrible and the acting is emotionless considering the content they just agree to off themselves rather then get eaten by cannibals like it s no big decision obviously mike is insane but just like in the first movie they treat the natives with such terrible behavior it s simply unrealistic ruggero deodato s movie easily feels the americans got what they deserved while in this movie one can hardly blame the natives for what befalls the americans yet again and because of that the movie feels somewhat pointless we already got the point from the first movie so why was the sequel made the lieutenant s name is rizzo could it get any worse oftentimes with movies such as these when you look up the cast you find they haven t really acted in much other films and their bios are all but non existent so you can imagine i was surprised to find giovanni lombardo radice in this movie who was in scorsese s gangs of new york now lt rizzo looked familiar and i found he was in the 2002 movie spiderman as a very tiny role as a tugboat captain reminds me of how william shatner went from being the admiral on the uss enterprise to a cop in a car irony sometimes irony works out shatner never could get the music right until his recent album has been which is really good just like bono of u2 never could get a haircut right and dan marino never could win no superbowls sometimes irony is just sad like christopher reeve superman can t walk irony the man will always be a legend though because he was such a great guy i digress yet again though at this point you can tell i m fairly bored of even discussing cannibal ferox cannibal holocaust s message was about who are the real savages and what is truly evil what the savages do in natural living unknown to our moral records or what we do to others with malicious intent cannibal ferox s message seems to be be careful what you go looking for for you just might find it i will say this for cannibal ferox when gloria comes back and writes her dissertation asserting that cannibalism does not exist she saves others who would be curious and go where angels fear tread but overall this movie was really bad 10,0
22669,i was swept into this series just as surely as the sea would sweep me into its grip although it started out slowly i found that the realism in depicting the ship the variety of characters and lively dialogue keep me watching the protagonist was destined to be challenged grow and change on this voyage and i wanted to be there for it i was not disappointed the series took you from humor to tragedy and everything in between often in the same scene the same breath there was a wealth of emotional overlaying interaction and expression relentless and compelling to observe the movement of the ship added an almost fanciful component to the many scenes making the characters ill one moment and adding humor the next edmund talbot is a complex character the likes of which we don t see often we may know where the captain stands or mr prettiman but they are older men set in their ways talbot was young and arrogant still learning testing himself and being tested he struggled getting along with others and made mistakes like a real person would but had a heart that could be touched that grew with each hard taught experience i appreciate the excellent characterization it s too rare in movies and television,1
11983,this movie had all the potential and makings of a great feel good great love story the cast is perfect the visuals work the original premise works the characters work but the story moves from one chess move to the next in a most predictable way not one character in the movie has any depth or has any depth explained by the director all we know about catherine zeta jones character is she is obsessed with her world nobody is allowed in and nobody challenges her world that much is obvious but the remaining characters all have their own dimensions that are really never explored or exposed aaron eckhart s character had so much more to offer to the story but wasn t allowed abigail breslin s character is so easy to understand that her performance comes across somewhat predictable and phony in the end everything reverts back to the forced turbulent world of catherine zeta jones which the audience never totally falls for honestly her turbulent world is not much more than a portrayal of a selfish self obsessed spoiled lady who most people would not have much time or sympathy for in the real world the director needed to make her a hero and never does in the end it is eckhart s character that ultimately wins because he wins not a lousy movie just a movie that could have been a lot better with more depth of personalities allowed in explained and exposed cheers,0
2693,if rich people are different from us because they have more money then film makers are different from us because they think the world cares about their every thought this self indulgent piece of tripe seems to have been made just because the director felt it was time to make another movie and someone would finance it not every trivial idea or reflection is worthy of a movie unless you are a college film student trying to complete a course when you don t have anything to say sometimes it is best to remain quiet the visuals are not breath taking they are quite ordinary the dialog is inane and unbelievable they speak words no one would every sequence together in situations that are beyond imagination germaine greer s zipless f k is finally brought to the screen even if you believe in love at first sight no one falls into bed as easily as these characters they screw before they talk even more unbelievable is an aging balding director finding instant sex with the most beautiful chick in town though gravity is already getting to miss marceau at a youthful age,0
21896,a brilliant sherlock holmes adventure starring the brilliant basil rathbone and nigel bruce despite many other actors brilliantly playing holmes and watson and making a great job of it rathbone and bruce will always be the best two holmes takes a professor tobell from switzerland to london tobell is wanted by the nazi s he has a bomb sight that could win the second world war his bomb site has been split into four parts each hidden in books tobell agrees to give his bomb site to the british government on the night of his arrival tobell goes to the house of his girlfriend he has drawn some figures of men if tobell was to disappear the lady was to give the drawings to holmes on his journey home he is attacked but a policeman stops this and the attacker runs away tobell is happy for the british government to use his bomb site but refuses to give it to them tobell wants to look after it the bomb site is split into four parts each part completely useless without the other he gives one part each of this bomb site to one of his scientist friends then holmes s greatest fear happens tobell goes missing holmes visits the young lady tobell was with the night he was attacked she tells him about the drawings the drawings have been stolen she says only one man came in during the time tobell left to fix the light bulb the man she describes is professor moriarty he is working for the nazi s seen as he has the drawings holmes is done for but he finds the writing pad he used and using science he manages to see what tobell drew by looking at the next page on the pad he sees it s code he sees it s the name of four scientists the first three he works out the code for but he can t work out the fourth the three scientists he has worked out have been murdered and the bomb site has been taken holmes can t work out the fourth scientist but neither can moriarty disguised as a sailor holmes manages to get in moriarty s office moriarty sees straight away it s holmes puts him in a box and has him thrown in the sea but watson and lestrade insist they search the box and find holmes in it it s now obvious moriarty is at large holmes manages to work out the fourth code a frederick hoffner holmes gets round to his house straight away and get hoffner and the decisive fourth part to safety holmes now needs to get moriarty charged for working with the nazi s he pretends to be hoffner moriarty works out the fourth code and gets two men to go round and get hoffner they take him back and he comes face to face with moriarty meanwhile tobell is not in a good way he has been tortured and tortured to get the name of the fourth scientist moriarty has had it with holmes now he has got him and his death must be a long one for holmes the idea is to put him in his hospital put a needle in his vein and watch him die of blood loss drop by drop watson runs in and saves the day though moriarty gets away but holmes was only careless enough to leave moriarty s trap door open moriarty plunges sixty feet so moriarty dead no he makes his final outing in the film the woman in green but in green he is definitely dead a suicide he jumps off his roof it was moriarty s second of three appearances in the rathbone series a different actor playing him on each occasion his first appearance in the adventures of sherlock holmes was played by george zucco his second in this film he was played by lionell atwill and henry daniels plays him in his final outing in the woman in green the first three holmes films made by universal were set in the war as holmes triumphs over the nazi s the voice of terror was the first then this film and then sherlock holmes in washington then it was back to victorianish times with definite relations to edwardian and georgian george the fifth and sixth times this film had a close link to the sherlock holmes short story the dancing men which can be found in the return of sherlock holmes a great film though obvious propaganda it was a brilliant holmes outing,1
12253,just what is the point of this film it starts off as one film then changes track cheating us of a resolution to that film and ends as another movie which is nothing but a pale pale imitation of so many other schlock horror flicks you ve ever seen the overall impression is confusion in every respect and a great deal of hubris screenplay by tarantino direction by rodriguez two guys who have previously shown talent but who now seem to believe their own hype and assume that whatever they do must be good merely because they did it but it doesn t quite work that way you re only good while you continue doing good things there are so many questions to ask just what are george clooney and harvey keitel doing getting involved in such pointless dreck clooney initially makes an intriguing bad guy utterly ruthless and efficient and it would have been interesting to see where that was going but of course we never do and the clooney of the vampire film changes into a completely different character that s not clever or witty that s just bad bad work keitel looks thoroughly ill at ease throughout and no wonder did no one in the studio take a look at the script before this project was given the go ahead tarantino is utterly unpleasant as a murderous sexual deviant and why did he as writer assume we would find the rape gruesome murder and butchering of an inoffensive hostage funny on every level except the technical this film stinks avoid,0

14550,colonel chabert is one of the best adaptations from novel to screen i have seen in the movies it combines the realism of french cinema with excellent characterisation from depardieu s lost chabert to fabrice luchini s proud lawyer to fanny ardant s complex widow the movie has wonderful dimension as you might expect from a top cinematographer such as yves angelo the characters keep this movie in gear and although a bit slow in the beginning picks up pace and is a fine movie by the time it reaches the finish,1
16274,mark blankfield played jekyll and hyde michael mcguire was the dad tim thomerson was the plastic surgeon did you even see this movie i doubt it blankfield was fairly popular at this time for playing the pill popping doctor on fridays thomerson has been funny in anything he does from movies to series to stand up comedy if i ever find this movie on dvd i will definitely buy it i recorded this movie off of hbo back in 82 and have pretty much worn out the tape one of the funniest takes on the jekyll hyde theme ever of course with all the cocaine references in this movie it d be panned as being way too politically incorrect today as would cheech and chong too bad because it is funny funny funny,1

17794,leland p fitzgerald ryan gosling has committed an unspeakable crime the stabbing of the retarded younger brother of his ex girlfriend becky jena malone no one least of all leland himself can explain why he s done what he s done whether the act was premeditated or spontaneous done out of hatred or love in the detention center leland meets pearl madison don cheadle a onetime novel writer who sees in leland s case a second opportunity but pearl also wants to understand leland s motivation and takes him under his wing as a confidante in the prison the film jumps from the past to the present several times often allowing the past to act as a context to the present and vice versa writer director matthew ryan hodge shows how leland s crime and the events leading up to it affect the people in his life from becky to her family to leland s mother lena olin and estranged father kevin spacey to allen chris klein a young man who is staying with becky s family after the death of his own mother the chief asset in the movie is gosling who is perfectly cast as the 15 year old pseudopsychopath like bartleby the scrivener gosling s leland just exists he shows little emotion during the film but instead his expressions belie an ocean of guilt sadness love and rage each of the main actors offered perhaps their best work to date save spacey who s not exactly a novice special praise is due to malone and klein two young performers who are better known for lighthearted comedy fare than the heavy drama of this movie another huge benefit in terms of the story is that none of the characters is flawless none are heroes out to save the day this is simply not a black and white movie,1
2156,i am at a loss to find the words to express how bad i thought this film was the initial precept was promising but in all respects afterwards it was totally awful let s run through the main points plot good initial idea but truly terrible development there were many points when i thought no nobody would do something that stupid the ending was amazingly anticlimactic characterisation all of the characters were either completely bland or grotesque caricatures i keep trying to think of one that wasn t possibly the mother but that s it music intrusive inappropriate and generally terrible direction totally amateurish cinematography doubt they ve heard of it camera angles stability zoom levels often really bad i am totally bemused at how this film has scored so highly it s the worst movie i ve seen at the cinema for years if not ever,0
6565,why wasn t this voted for best picture of 1998 this has to be the best movie ever it makes something like citzen kane look like utter crap come on citzen kane wasn t even in color i love this movie it has to be the best movie i ve ever put money down on i am still shocked that it wasn t nominated for anything if 10 is the highest you can give it i give it 20,0
2891,i ve just watched fingersmith and i m stunned to see the 8 10 average rating for the show not only was the plot was difficult to follow but it seems character development was randomly applied the actors were adequate but in the process of attempting to create twists and turns their characters are rendered entirely one dimensional once this happens the story really falls flat and becomes tedious and just in case anyone didn t see the predictable lesbian undertones from miles way this is hammered home in the most banal terms at the end of the film the end scene is disappointing and phoned in and anyone who sat back and went ohhh so they were carpet munchers all along must have been out for the evening two stars for the tonsil hockey in the earlier scene which was at least a bit raunchy none for the rest of it,0
22755,when i saw this on tv i was nervous whats if they messed it up millions of families like mine that live with a brain damaged man in my case my dad would be let down i watched it with my mum and we both ended up crying it was so accurate and captured how the family feels as well as the person having suffered the brain injury the actors were all wonderful and i had no complaints my mums told me she hasn t been able to stop thinking about it i hope this program made many people aware of what it s like living with brain damage and what it s like for the families more programs like this should be made i was surprised at how good it was and it s really shook me up emotionally,1
5864,i m a fan of good plausible action movies and i m a huge fan of the elite military units such as the navy seals finally i m a huge fan of michael biehn sadly none of those allowed me to really enjoy this movie at the time i gave it another chance more recently when i bought the dvd here s the problems with this movie in a quick list 1 it s a poor mans top gun for example including a virtual music video of the seal team playing golf with a soundtrack of the boys are back in town which concludes with charlie sheen doing an inane chase to get his towed car back 2 this is quite simply a charlie sheen movie when sheen was trying to be famous before he started doing stuff like hot shots reports i ve heard indicate that sheen was a baby on the set and it affected the roles and direction the rest of the actors in the movie got 3 biehn is the head of the seal team yet sheen seldom obeys him any seal showing the lack of discipline that sheen s character does or who endangered the team as he does wouldn t even have made it through buds training let alone gotten on a team 4 seals are cross trained on weapons yet in one part of the movie a seal has to figure out how to use a u s stinger missile there are a few good scenes in the movie the assault entry at the beginning bill paxton as god and some of the footage in what was supposed to be beirut at the time overall though this movie is a loser,0
16027,i was lucky enough to see the horror classics dvd version of this film before it was mysteriously removed from the 4 film dvd and replaced with something else the picture and sound quality of the film on that edition was a nightmare in itself yet that version is still superior to the one with the deluxe dvd treatment the reason was stated in brad fiedel s interview segments on the special edition dvd he had noted what i first found so striking about this film this being the use of music at moments of inactivity in the film but leaving the moments of activity in silence thus giving the horror scenes a stronger feel the problem with this reissue is it carries the extra film score used to fill in these intentional gaps in score fiedel complained of this and made it clear that the filler music was not his the music actually sounded a lot like howard shore s work for videodrome sad for me that i am also a major fan of that film and have to associate the two the film itself managed to add some interesting realistic elements to the genre horror film a group of friends go up on a mountain one of them inherited on the mountain they are confronted with a family with a nightmarish secret the movie moves along at a great pace in fact every time i have seen it i still find myself shocked to see 45 minutes had passed before things started really going wrong for the campers while the horror classics version is filled with many gaps the fact that there is no score accompanying the horror scenes is what makes this film intelligent and even superior to most slasher films i have ever seen the director jeff lieberman had made some unique horror films previous to this one making this one the most mainstream and yet very different to the mainstream at the same time it is a good fun film with surprising acting performances to boot the new spiffed up dvd version is worth a rent the now collectors item horror classics version now oop is worth the hunt,1
15238,i ll be brief i normally hate films like this venomously but there is just something about this one that just draws me in and won t let me go granted there are some major flaws in it some of the acting is below par at best and the dialogue is sometimes so poor it s funny but there are enough redeeming features to make it watchable to the end but what are they well it s got a cool little plot by no means is it original but it is better presented than other films of its kind the three main stars whalin johnson long put in fairly decent performances that more than make up for the distinct lack of quality from the supporting cast the fat cop and coach quinn really bugged me and the scripting is slick and witty even if it is poor in places the bottom line is though this film is so cute i grinned all the way through it and it has a place in my video collection purely because it could cheer up anybody you really have to be some kind of humourless bore not to like this i dare somebody to sit through this without grinning i do recommend this one if you want a simple fun and above all enjoyable watch you won t regret it top,1
5334,i started watching this because i thought it was a really shitty porno as i kept watching the only thrill i got from this movie was finding out what the name of it was so i could look it up and rip on it i just finished it and have considered ending my life knowing that someone actually made this movie for the people who commented on this movie as having a good script and great acting my words of wisdom for you are that you probably have no friends because you were in the movie you are probably wishing you had all that time back of your life that you wasted on making this movie there is no way that this is a serious movie there was an old guy that gets stabbed and it doesn t even hurt him at all and when everyone else gets stabbed they drop dead it was probably important that these people killed random people and ate them and also hung out with an 80 year old man that wanted to put the parts into his body my favorite part was when the old man found the hemoglobens or however you spell it because that made the movie seem very intellectual and probably helped to reach the older crowd what really blew my mind that they decided to throw in that random scene about the college girls going into the woods looking for fake skulls if you do attempt to see this movie you should probably fill up your bathtub and drop your hairdryer in it and be ready to jump in this is a must see for anyone who believes there life could not get any worse because this will help you realize there are people out there the makers of this movie who are even more pathetic and are going no where in life,0
11969,the initiation to the local sport team involves taking the newbies out to the corn fields and guess what there is a scarecrow murdering people there only one of the newbies survive but falls into a coma due to diabetes meanwhile the scarecrow starts to kill all of the involved people one by one whats the scarecrows secret will they find it out before the scarecrow gets them all this is a low budget movie and it shows sound is ok but picture is really corny the plot script really sucks and is quite pathetic and non logical the acting is really bad and sometimes just laughable cant really say much about the special effects cause there aren t that many but the few there is ranges from bad to ok for a low budget that is there is some nudity and thats probably the only thing worth to watch in the movie that is if your a horny teenager if not skip the movie all together another complete waste of time and money so don t see it goes for hack n slash fans too,0
23269,this wonderful 3 part bbc production is one of the sweetest love stories that i have seen in a while the actresses display a very high level of talent especially rachael stirling as nan astley she is funny seductive and cute the love making scenes and the close up kisses are very erotic regardless of one s sexual preference the characters are well defined and very believable i guess this is a by product of a good adaptation from a well written novel a truly remarkable well paced drama that picks up speed quickly after a couple of boring but necessary scenes in the beginning my vote 9 10,1
11344,i left the theater and i was only 10 years old that s how bad it sucked the plot was horrid and the acting was worse leslie nielson should be ashamed of himself and so should the person who made this movie i was only 10 years old when i went to see this catastrophe with a friend and even at that young innocent age i did not laugh once at the movie we me and my friend still laugh about how bad the movie was we ended up going into the r movie my parents were in bottom line this flick was fricking bad mr magoo more like mr ma who this movie could have scarred me for life had i watched the popular cartoon on television as a child but luckily i had never seen it so i was spared the agony but i will never get back those precious minutes of my life that i wasted,0
21944,spoilers throughout this is a very strange film particularly for its time in every respect for six years american movies had shown american soldiers as everybody s son brother father in movies like the best years of our lives and til the end of time our hearts are tugged by the difficulty that the sweet returning soldiers have in adjusting to peace and their families yet in this same year this film shows soldiers as a mix of people rather worse than the viewer one message of this film is lock up your daughters even the good soldiers with plenty of time on their hands are gambling all the time getting stupefyingly drunk and are wholly indifferent to whether they even have wives any more and their reaction to the police investigating a murder is to conspire against them mitchum the most sympathetic soldier says things like i don t know if my wife wants to make a go of it now after the war haven t seen her in two years do i care not really maybe we ll make a go of it maybe not another soldier is shown as unusually sensitive because after years away he would like to see his wife again later when this soldier states at the police station that he spent the evening at a whore s home without knowing his wife is sitting just behind him there seems to be no question whatever that his wife will be fine indeed she is i guess it s hey soldiers will be soldiers the police detective played by robert young who is trying to crack a murder case states convincingly and with infinite weariness about someone s account of their actions on the night in question do i care no i don t really care about anything any more i ve done this too long i guess a man shows up at the whore s apartment he says i m just a man like you interested in the whore then he says no that s a lie i m her husband i d like to be in the military i was turned down before then he says no that s a lie why would i want to be a soldier he goes through another series of lies when the police ask him who he is to the end of the movie we haven t a clue who he is or why he is there he s one of the strangest characters in the history of movies a man stands with his girlfriend at a bar talking to four soldiers when a clumsy soldier knocks a drink onto his girlfriend she leaves to change her dress and is right back wearing another no problem yet the man doesn t leave with his girlfriend who simply disappears but instead follows one of the soldiers when he leaves to go to another area of the bar the man then extrapolates from the minimal information he s learned about the soldier to philosophize grandly about the problems of returning soldiers and immediately invites the soldier home because he is drunk and feels sick this is strange stuff similarly a dance hall girl is irritated by the sentimental soldier who would like to take her out for a real dance and dinner maybe yet she does dance with him and immediately gives him the key to her home were people in the late 1940s always urging soldiers to come to their homes after they just met them robert ryan kills his host a stranger when he s enraged that the jewish host tries to get the steadily drunker ryan out of his home the reason for the murder no jew tells me how to drink how to drink huh what does that mean this movie is always off kilter quite deliberately so the soldiers act consistently with total complete defiance of the law and all the characters are as cold and tough as any movie i ve ever seen and yet the movie is utterly gripping you simply have no idea how these people are going to act or what new bizarre character is going to pop up without anyone thinking the person s actions are strange in the least e g the wife s behavior the acting is about the finest i e ever seen from robert young robert ryan gloria grahame who earned an oscar nomination paul kelly and other actors i d never heard of i d never heard of this movie and it s a complete delight that i ve discovered one that i shall want to see again and again and again it s really strange but impossible to look away from because you ve no idea what these creatures will do next,1

12955,although it doesn t seem very promising for a long stretch renoir s french cancan ends up being an effortlessly charming film the story is clich a laundry girl nini fran oise arnoul is discovered by a night club owner danglard jean gabin danglard steals her from her baker boyfriend and drops his current girlfriend both of whom come back for their former lovers nini has to choose whether to go back to her humble life with the baker go on with the show with her employer oh or become a princess as a prince falls in love with her at one point too i m glad the film didn t go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have the film ends with the opening of danglard s new night club the moulin rouge and a couple of gorgeous song and dance numbers the first of them complainte de la butte which also provides the base of most of the film s musical score is simply one of the most gorgeous songs ever written and renoir himself wrote it if you re a fan of baz luhrmann s 2001 film moulin rouge you ll recognize the tune as it comes up near the beginning of that film sung by rufus wainwright although it isn t very prominent in that film everyone i know who owns the soundtrack loves it in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen it s hard not to fall head over heels in love with that girl 8 10,1
17955,richard condie s utter maddness insanity cartoon the big snit is a trip through qwerkyness madness hillarity enjoyable backgrounds melting characters and a conclusion that nearly brings me to happy tears everytime i see it this short i have seen over and over and over and i never tire of it luckily having it on tape from a broadcast on tv it never stops to make me burst out in laughter uncontrollably and then reach down into the depths of my spirit highlighting the greatness of the human condition cause when someone says come on let s finish the game everything is alright in the world and the troubles that we face everyday we suddenly realise are all petty fleeting things not to fight or worry about anymore this film at first seems just like a simple exercise in cartoon slapstick humour but it is far more than that this film hits a greater sense of spiritual meaning with mankind in the wake when everything seems to be so bad and trivial it is flawless in every way and damn funny too rating 10 out of 10,1
8004,terrible action movie in which lead franco nero exchanges his cowboy hat gun belt and the coffin he dragged around in django 1966 for an all white ninja outfit with all the snazzy paraphernalia that goes with it despite virtually non stop action the film is utterly clich d and unintentionally funny with a campy villain to boot in christopher george susan george no relation is the attractive woman with a washed up husband nero s wartime companion whom the villains are trying to push off her oil rich land but the latter haven t counted upon nero s martial arts and stunt heavy gymnastics the solution to their problems is to hire a similarly skilled ninja for themselves who as it happens turns out to be nero s deadly enemy played by sho kosugi who appeared in two more sequels and is currently engaged in another the climax takes place inside an arena where one man army nero eliminates george and what has remained of his gang from previous confrontations the subtle way in which he despatches his nemesis however is effectively done,0
6028,jesus christ what the hell happened here this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen how is it possible that they screwed up such a nice idea for a movie to tell you the truth i was so hyped for this i though it was like blair witch but with actual alien creatures chasing the camera guy goddamn it i have been reduced to fast forwarding this pile of sh t and i never do that while seeing movies the high rating here on imdb makes me believe that actual aliens are giving 10 s for this piece of crap invasion is about well an invasion the movie starts by saying that everything you re about to see is real blahblahblah then they go and tell me about a special camera system used in cars as if i need to believe their bullsh t to enjoy this movie next thing you know i m seeing the most boring car driving ever filmed in a forest at night mind you is this a movie or a disney theme park ride the first 20 minutes is all boring dialog between cops while seeing grass and one straight road with a flashlight where the hell were the aliens they were sleeping of course then we learn that bad acting is not only reduced to high school plays as the cop behind the camera goes out of his car to look for a missing man who was nightfishing and had stumbled upon a mysterious meteorite i wonder what happens to him out of nowhere we see the nightfishing guy walking like a zombie the cop is apparently too dumb to notice that something is wrong with this man apparently he was indeed dumb as the zombie alien guy injects in the cop s ear some sort of alien parasite thus changing him into an alien then the cop alien goes back into his car looks for a young couple that were having sex a while back in the forest gets to them changes the guy into an alien and then the girl runs to the cop s car and escapes if this quick plot introduction didn t get it in your head that this movie was bad then the following 40 minutes will watching this movie is as painful as stabbing yourself repeatedly with a plastic fork the script while it may sound interesting on the back of the dvd box is badly directed and sadly we are left with another boring straight to dvd atrocity the only thing that kept me awake were the constant flashing and loud sound effects lamentably if seeing the same forest trail for 63 minutes is not enough we must endure crappy flashing techniques to scare the viewer and constant wailing of a bad actress that gets old and annoying pretty quick if you feel you must rent this i say to you why there are better scifi horror films out there even the dreaded remake of the invasion of the body snatchers is more entertaining than this for the love of all things good don t bother with his crap my eyes bled and for the first time i wanted suicide a 1 10 avoid this like a disease,0
7385,the fun that was present in the other movies has all but disappeared with this third effort which means the rubbishy production values show through more than ever another 2 parter the chinese web cobbled together this one suffers from too much padding not to mention weak spidey action taking place in such uninspired locations as a car park apartment and printing press nicholas hammond is as endearing as ever struggling valiantly against the drab production and lame performances of the rest of the cast the plot in which peter and spidey help a chinese official defeat charge of corruption during world war ii by locating three marines who could testify as to his innocence doesn t exactly scream comic book sprung to life does it,0
9274,i saw this late at night on a minor channel and i put it on expecting a laugh or two martin lawrence is a good comic actor and i reckoned he might be a good stand up comedian actor in the style of richard pryor i couldn t have been more wrong this concert was awful it was full of racist comments directed at white people muslims and people from india muslims and indians are the same thing in lawrence s narrow mind and rambling clich d cod philosophy lawrence like many black comics and directors can t resist the urge to preach when given a platform do we really need a lecture on martin luther king and the civil rights struggle during a stand up comedy show then there were his fawning comments designed to ingratiate him with women it made my skin crawl listening to him worst of all the show simply wasn t funny and i found it boring i turned over halfway through and flipped back to find him either still preaching or going on and on and on about the birth of his child there was no humour in the story of the birth of his child and it was self indulgent on his part to bore us with the details he clearly didn t have very much to say or he would have cut this section of the show out this show was rubbish runteldat,0

20825,it was easy to dismiss this film as hyperbole at the time of its release fonda douglas and lemmon were known lefties but the accident at three mle island provided shocking context to this fictional drama this film works on many levels taking shots at both public utilities and tv news 1979 was the zenith of the infamous happy talk format of tv news see also ron burgundy and it s on display here in all its glory the sonorous anchor grimly reads a story about a grinding head on collision before cheerfully introducing kimberley wells fonda doing a story about a veterinarian who makes house or is that aquarium calls the show s producer and the station manager argue about content or lack thereof behind the scenes there are a few technical errors the pr flack james hampton shows fonda and douglas the requisite scale model of a pressurized water reactor plant built by westinghouse later as lemmon and wilford brimley nicely playing lemmon s friend colleague caught between duty and loyalty fight a sudden crisis in the plant s control room they re obviously running a boiling water plant built by ge a small point but curious considering how many details the screenwriters got right like any good drama the film asks more questions than it answers the real world accident at tmi proves the film s basic premise the working title for the film was originally power and you ll see why as nuclear power prepares to make a comeback in these days of 3 gas the china syndrome is as relevant today as it was over 25 years ago,1
20802,i loved this movie movies and plays fulfill their purpose when they expose social political and other problems that affect the majority this movie served that purpose i identify with the plot and know people to whom this has happened at the time this movie was made concepts presented in this flick were advanced for the public yet had already happened to friends of mine by way of people in powerful positions and i know what it is like when people do to you what they did to angela bennett because they have done it to me i greatly enjoyed sandra bullock s portrayal of angela bennett ruth marx she portrays a pretty intelligent and witty young woman who has the courage to avoid giving up to overwhelming odds fight hard to keep her sanity and restore her life and try to protect those whom she loves losing her self concept and succumbing to that age old attempt to bolster a sagging self esteem by indulging in sex with a stranger added a poignant touch of reality the climax of the plot reveals the only real solution to this kind problem,1
15021,i caught this movie on tv yesterday i had a certain curiosity about it being that it was directed by emilio estevez and starring him and his real life dad martin sheen i love to see a movie about a father son relationship that involves a real life father and son naturally there s an instant chemistry between sheen and estevez and their scenes of conflict are even more intense knowing that they re actually related of course it helps that the two of them are both terrific actors i ve seen martin sheen in intense roles before but i think this is emilio s most intense role being that i mostly recall him from the mighty ducks series and i was very impressed talent really does run in that family and kathy bates steals the movie in an oscar worthy performance she tugged at my heartstrings with every word of dialogue kimberly williams the beautiful actress from the father of the bride movies is also very good holding her own among a group of talented veteran actors the movie is a bit stagey with dialogue that s obviously geared for the stage but that didn t bother me this is not meant to be an action movie this is a character study and for a film that s based on a play it never gets too claustrophobic when emilio s character jeremy reminisces to his days in vietnam we actually see his harrowing memories brought to life the film is extremely powerful and realistic without being sentimental at the end i expected all the conflicts to be resolved and the family would become hunky dory but that s not how it turned out the ending made me cry without resorting to standard hollywood melodrama that proves reality is much more gripping than anything hollywood can conjure up if you re in the mood for a beautiful powerful drama with extremely wonderful performances that will knock your socks off please check out this underrated gem hopefully one day martin and emilio will unite with charlie and they will all make a great film together my score 9 out of 10,1
20336,my cousins and i have watched this movie ever since we were little i don t know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family s memories i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch it is an old movie but don t let that fool you this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other,1

9,honestly awful film bad editing awful lighting dire dialog and scrappy screenplay the lighting at is so bad there s moments you can t even see what s going on i even tried to playing with the contrast and brightness so i could see something but that didn t help they must have found the script in a bin the character development is just as awful and while you hardly expect much from a jean claude van damme film this one manages to hit an all time low you can t even laugh at the cheesy ness the directing and editing are also terrible the whole film follows an extremely tired routine and fails at every turn as it bumbles through the plot that is so weak it s just unreal there s not a lot else to say other than it s really bad and nothing like jean claude van damme s earlier work which you could enjoy avoid like the plaque frankly words fail me in condemning this film,0
17216,at 2 37pm in a bathroom at an adelaide highschool a student takes their own life and the different worlds of six teenagers are changed forever 2 37 is a brutal honest and breathtaking film centered on the pain of being a teenager the film follows one day in the lives of six teenagers all intertwined all dealing with their own personal dramas while there are a couple of stereotypes in the mix the beautiful would be popular girl dealing with body issues the over achiever obsessed with his grades there are several horrors that are as far from main stream as you can get including a social outcast dealing with a brutal illness and a young girl trying to make sense of a devastating event in her past the movie is mixed with documentary style interviews from the characters which some viewers may find a little out of place in the otherwise seamless narrative the pace is also a little slow but it fits with the feel of the movie the young australian actors are all stars in their own right in particular theresa palmer who s heartbreaking performance earned her an afi nomination the film is very well shot with terrific direction some scenes are a little hard to watch in particular the five minute long suicide scene but overall it is a film that leaves a big impact on its viewers it draws you in right from it s shocking opening scene and keeps you guessing as to which of the six main characters is going to be the one to end up in the bathroom ultimately it s a beautiful made but slightly disturbing look at teenage life,1
20062,i had the great pleasure of recently viewing this beautifully filmed wide screen adaption of the the 1943 stage revival which unlike the original 1935 production which included extensive spoken recitatives this had been the fashion at the time so to blame the film for an 16 year tradition the film should be seen if only for sammy davis jrs brilliant catlike performance as sportin life creeping in and out of shadows his seduction of dorothy dadridge s bess there s a boat dat s leavin soon for new york is one of many highlights nearly all of the principal music is intact and beautifully sung it certainly never bores which the recent pbs and met versions did it was a pleasure to see that time had not diminished the movie and hopefully it will be made available in the near future for the generations that haven t had a chance to experience it,1
20640,i loved this movie it was adorably touching and funny finally here s a story about a group of people who meet some challenges flounder a bit and then decide to just be themselves and end up happy for when was the last time you saw that in a film dealing with the fluidity of life love and sexuality the characters are faced with real problems albeit in often ridiculous situations like the men s group camping trip and the explicit realatory liaisons and manage to learn and grow without the movie getting preachy darkly desperate or too unrealistic you ll love and care about the characters who far from being hollow stereotypes portray real people with just a touch of the truth behind their would be labels a good romcom for a saturday afternoon and the only movie i ve ever seen where sexual fluidity ends happily and no one is forced to be anything they don t want to be far better than kissing jessica stein a good choice if your tired of watching gay movies that have some painful lesson and bitter lesson or maybe you just like a good british romp james purefoy looks dashing as always and tom hollander is deliciously funny so go forth watch enjoy you won t regret it,1
11752,like the previous two mad max films mad max beyond thunderdome is not exception to the violence and strange plot mad max is in a post war society where he must destroy master blaster and get the children to tomorrow morrow land this is generally a warped film with peter pan references and tina turner methane pigs and odd characters i got very bored by watching it all and it offered nothing to me i did not feel inspired after watching this film the only decent thing about this film were the extremely odd characters that got picked off in various ways throughout the film it s too weird for me and it was much too dull,0

18181,the student nurses is an excellent film that deals with four women bonded by friendship and career for the first time one is able to see a realistic portrayal of relationships inside the work place outside the work place the risks of those relationships and the consequences this film also offers a rare chance to see veteran stage and television actress katherine scottie macgregor as the nurses instructor miss boswell ms macgregor is best known for her performance as mrs oleson on the television series little house on the prairie the direction music and print color are very good as well as the opening theme song performed by clancy b grass iii this film offers a rare opportunity for those who enjoy themes centered around the late 1960s and early 1970s which offers a softer side to life while appreciating the beauty of the female sex,1
7114,the moral of this show is that bad eating habits give people bad hair bad taste in clothes bad posture bad jobs and on and on they are obviously miserable and loathe themselves however if they learn to eat broccoli they will be wealthy successful and attractive tlc ought to be ashamed of themselves for this blatant exploitation of parental fears and guilt if nutrition is really that important they should be able to develop a show using honest and truthful methods if they really believed in their computer simulations i d like to see them do a double blind test by finding some 40 year olds finding out what their eating and exercise habits were as children and age progressing the kids photos then compare to the real things hey that sounds like a project for mythbusters discovery channel are you listening tlc must stand for tabloid lies and cons,0
24302,i am a big fan of larkin s works i believe that he was amid the greatest 20th century poets the film itself does a great justice to the bard of hull wonderfully portrayed by all the players in their roles bonneville does do a service to the sexually repressed larkin he avoids an impression and strays from becoming a caricature the use of his poetry was the highlight of the piece itself rather than acting out the massive intensity with which larkin felt the use of his words themselves give a better insight into plot and add a much more sombre but altogether more fascinating atmosphere most enjoyable,1
4451,this is simply another bad chuck norris movie norris plays a cop on the trail of a twisted serial killer of women he put the guy away three years before but the guy somehow gets through the bars in the nut house he s in by using what looks like dental floss then the killer escapes in a cleaning van and drives it over a 400 foot cliff and survives to spend time around a theater undergoing renovation irish jack o halloran is the best thing in this movie but like in superman ii he doesn t say a word somehow that s supposed to make him more menacing ron o neal of super fly fame and steve james are wasted playing the city s mayor and norris sidekick respectively the film also contains the idiotic subplot of norris and his girlfriend having a child out of wedlock it s so 1980 s when coupling norris serious acting turn with over the top musical cues signaling every forthcoming scene in predictable fashion the film becomes a chore to sit through the build up while searching for the killer in the theater is interesting enough with norris crawling through the shadows to discover the hideaway but the end fight is disappointing after beginning in such a promising way it s yet another disappointment from cannon films and it plays like a movie made for television of 4 stars,0
6184,i love most jet li movies with the exception of romeo must die and i bought this movie in a very cheap three pack with the master and twin warriors while twin warriors was very impressive and i was thoroughly intrigued by it and the master was a bit karate kid but also enjoyable i thought this movie was terrible i m not just saying that because i m used to better movies i m saying that it was almost down there with kazaam the fight scenes were terrible blurry cameras and no real fighting and the plot was your typical stupid kung fu plot if you are going to have a plot this stupid see man turns into woman to become all powerful then falls in love with jet li you best have some great fighting to go with it if you are looking for an original hk jet li movie i suggest you go rent shaolin temple 2 aka kids from shaolin,0
12076,childish storyline ripped off of a lame hollywood movie terrible acting cheesy dialogue and not quite up to par sex scenes that s right another great softcore parody i enjoyed this film greatly sure the acting is terrible but that part of the fun the storyline is ludicrous but some things must be sacrificed when the story has to revolve around girl on girl sex scenes and because it s only softcore no penetration the sex scenes were a little bland but it s like the great god of softcore smut russ meyers said who really cares what goes down beneath the waist i don t know if i d agree with mr meyers on this one but what the hell the flick entertained me for an hour and a half i give it a c it would ve been a solid b if they coulda cast more of the girls to look like russ meyers actresses vavoom vavoom,0
7098,being a fan of marlene dietrich s films i was very anxious to see this documentary i also got sucked in by reading rave review after rave review from the national critics that should have tipped me off the movie is just plain boring and obviously extremely overrated you don t even see dietrich she is heard in the background discussing her movies and this video she does almost nothing but complain about everything what a drag the filmmaker maximilian schell constantly complains himself and pleads with her to be on camera all to no avail she just keeps refusing to cooperate after awhile this sort of thing gets really tiring with her attitude why would schell continue with this project he should have just told the prima donna to shove it regardless of what you read do not waste your time with this,0
22259,i don t know how i would feel if i lived in usa i would watch some preview scenes advertisements i would know sidney pollack directed it harrison ford and kristin scott thomas starring in i would watch this film as soon as possible without reading any bad review would i be disappointment i read a lot of review which is said how bad this film was this is boring long film without passion emotions and it is not interesting harrison is wooden cold the sublots should be cut too serious particularly for harrison ford i am interested in the subject and i like harrison ford in the films which are not actions i like sidney pollack and kristin scott thomas too so reading the reviews on imdb website then in other sites then in february in the hungarian movie magazines i was wonder and wonder what the film was anyway there are films directors stars what who i want to see despite any reviews i can understand people who thinks this film is boring and cold and has got not any passion but i feel different it is true i liked sliding doors the forbidden woman this is a french film i don t know what its title in english or in french basic of these films is development of a love i think random heart is a nice and interesting film in its own way it may be true that the sublots the congress election and the cop s investigation after a corrupt policeman are not written well are not worked out in details but add something to the leading woman and man character after his wife s death and betrayal emotion angry of dutch comes to the surface during his work he will be suspicious and almost lost his best friend then the woman too the film shows two ways to survive the tragedy our wife husband s death and cheating one of them is the woman s this is tragedy but the life is continuing she doesn t want to mourn forever what she wants to know what her husband s lover the cop s wife thought about her she will not learn never she is forced to behave in this way the elections are comes and anything about his husband may become scandal she wants her daughter not to be disappointment with her father the man is a cop he suffering from the fact he lived in lies he wants to know maybe every men would want to know in this situation when his wife started to cheat him how long had she got lover he needs the woman s help but she doesn t want but the guy is stubborn and steady persistent the woman can t stand him because he always steps into her life and she cannot forget their relationship is tense at the beginning then slowly developments a type of silent sympathy which is prefer an alliance against the outside world the tragedy i said it in spite of that they made love in bed however the cop can t stop with investigation can t stop close and can t allow the woman close to him but he starts the love and the woman wants their relationship to continue but it can t the woman realizes it the end is a bit sad but logic and nice at the same time it was pleasant for me to see again peter coyote i like this man s face sidney pollack i hardly knew bonnie hunt but she was good i think harrison ford did an okay job his eardrop is unusual but at the beginning then finally i believed that the woman liked being at his company in spite of his temperament it was pity he had not got any joke but ford has got a good sense of humour a reviewer noticed in hungary ford is charismatic against his haircut and ear drop and we are waiting for his presence and would like him to smile at us and make an ironic notice but dr jones is not smiling at us but he smiles at the end and it is soooo good with the rest i agree i very like him in this role he is good in acting of this a bit rough cool but somewhere in his soul smart cop the character of kristin scott thomas is a woman who is determined self confident but she is closed inside a ivory tower and she keeps aloof from her emotions but she is a really woman who become indecisive and find support on the cop the two cool reserved people find each other maybe the script is not good it is full of common banal sentence but there are some humorous sentences from the woman and movement particularly from the man it is a good film but not for everybody not for the general big audience i watched the females under 18 and males above 45 liked this film better about the latter maybe sidney pollack made this film for his age group which doesn t go to multiplex anyway i advice the people who like energetic plots with action scenes who like only ford s action films miss this movie,1
21125,scandinavians are pretty good at making me laugh at the drab nothingness of my soulless life huh the film making here was incredibly meticulous every piece of framing every deadpan stare every element of the colour palette every snippet of muzak or whooosh of those street cleaners was there to hammer home this world s calm emptiness in fact i think i might have found the general sense of emptiness overbearing had its absurdity not been genuinely funny and relatable like when andreas is telling his boss that he misses children and looks up and the guy is smiling and halfway out the door it s a sort of sad but true reflection of working with people spending 7 8 hours a day with them seeing more of them than the folk you love but ultimately knowing deep down they don t give a damn about your troubles and you the same this might have been a film the coens had made had they been born in oslo and not minnesota i think their humour is more aggressive and more wrapped up in cinema s past but they have the same mastery of technique and their films have the same underlying sense that life is pretty inconsequential i ll stop before i talk myself into taking a bus into the wintry wilderness,1
19431,dirty dancing i think everyone has seen this movie at one time or another i can remember as a kid i loved this movie and watched it over and over again without tiring of it now that i m a little older i bought the dvd recently and still wasn t disappointed with the performance swayze and grey create the atmosphere for this movie even though it s claimed they don t get along the chemistry in the movie is unbelievable as the movie proceeds we are sucked into their relationship and believe every single one of their actions the soundtrack is amazing the music only adds to the romantic mood of the movie and adds to the relationship between baby patrick the last scene makes this movie who can ever forget the famous line noboby puts baby in the corner the song is perfect and the dancing is amazing i would recommend this movie to anyone at any age it s just a fun movie anyone can enjoy 8 10,1
6694,i speak badly of g i j t m mostly because i think it lacked something that g i joe had yes it had something that g i joe didn t have like celebrity cameos by don johnson and burgess meredith but i think g i joe the movie lacked the passion for the characters that the g i joe tv series had most of the voice over artists really sounded like they were dead pan and they were going to die at anytime now it s a good movie but i wouldn t say that it was the greatest movie in the world i m h o although violence is what g i joe was built on i d say that serpentor striking duke in his chest wasn t the very best way for charlie adler s character to go out neither was seeing golobulus remind cobra commander why he was chosen to lead the cobra forces and then being horribly mutated after he failed to deliver what cobra la felt was rightfully theirs it wasn t the best way for the g i joe series to go out but it s better than nothing,0
4289,the blame of this terrible flick lies with the director martin campbell after viewing a few of his credits in later years this must have been one of his first directorial gigs he had a more than decent cast to work with but unfortunately he had no idea what he was doing there were scenes that made absolutely no sense at all where was his head was he on drugs i was looking forward to this movie just because of oldman bacon maybe it was a short shooting schedule and campbell just had to bang it out i can t imagine that the story that campbell directed even came close to the story that the writer wrote oldman bacon along with the rest of the cast must have slid under their chairs if they went to the screening as one poster pointed out karen young did do a pretty good fight scene with bacon she really did let loose it s unfortunate that i have to fill in more space just to stay within the guide lines of what the imdb requires because i really don t have anything more to say about this uninspiring film one does not have to be forced to be a windbag when criticizing a terrible flick and wish that the imdb would change the amount of words to fill up a critique,0
4142,my friend zac rented this movie free of charge since his mom works at a rental store i still feel ripped off since i won t ever be able to get those 100 minutes of my life back having watched the first dark harvest the night prior to this viewing i expected to at least see a crappy remake of the first film wrong there isn t a single scarecrow in the movie unless you count the one of the cover of the box nor are there any real death scenes the movie got its r rating from an 8 year old girl screaming god d n at her father there is no amount of tequila that could make this movie bearable believe me we tried,0
6530,i really wanted to see this film i thought the plot was really unique and intriguing a cop andy garcia has a son who is dying and needs bone marrow replacement in order to live the only match is a convicted serial killer who escapes from jail to save his son he has to track down the killer michael keaton plays the convict in one of many disappointing aspects of the film keaton is a great actor at times but here he is pretty much boring it s over the top to the point where you just stop caring garcia is better but tries too hard for a film that isn t up to par barbet schroeder at one time such a promising director with films like barfly that amounted to pretty much nothing in the american market directs well enough i honestly thought the script was the culprit here it s just a big mess the film ultimately wastes a lot of good material good actors and a good director all because of a faulty script what should have been a tense and thought provoking film is just a hollywood action dud,0
15166,craig brewer is now officially a writer director for whom i will see any film by no matter how bad it may look his debut hustle and flow was one of my favorites from that year with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic fallible characters i wasn t quite sure what i would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort the cast seemed great the trailer used music effectively however it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity and fast fortunately black snake moan hits all its marks dead on the acting is astonishing the writing superb and the editing style as well as juxtaposed music riveting the whole way brewer seems to be a master at getting his characters to have the right mix of both compassion and malice as they set forward on their paths toward redemption the first moment i knew i was in for a treat was during the abbreviated credit sequence at the beginning like he did with hustle and flow brewer lays the music over the widescreen shots perfectly with simply titled fonts coming up statically the 70 s aesthetic was welcome and helped show that this would be another great character piece in the vain of those from that decade of some of cinema s best from here we continued on with the short snippets into the lives of both lazarus and rae each vignette mirroring the other while they journey to the fateful moment their paths finally cross the editing between them was fluid and relevant rather than abruptly cutting before the scene felt finished with its purpose rae s boyfriend leaves for duty in the service and laz s wife leaves him for his brother each feels the loneliness and reverts to what they know in that situation rae to sex and laz to the bottle only when rae is left for dead at the side of the road and her savior comes from his farm to take her in does the reasoning for their actions finally start to become clear samuel l jackson is fantastic as the older bluesman farmer trying to reconcile his life with god and that of the flesh and the pain it has brought him there are the moments of stoic sternness as well as those of kindheartedness with his captive patient you never really look at the setup as comical or unrealistic because he sells what he is doing so well also the character of rae is not chained up for very long despite what the trailers would have you believe the situation starts a bit awkward until we see that the chaining was for her own good and is actually used for only a day or two as for that chained girl christina ricci really shines i never really saw her as anything special but this role is a true breakthrough for her this girl is so troubled that her past sexual abuse has scarred her very deep down any time she is away from her love she starts seeing flashes of the man who took her childhood innocence away and itches to be touched by any man available to let the image go away her nymphomania is not for pleasure but rather for survival from the haunting nightmares always hiding behind her eyelids ricci fully inhabits the role and shows all the emotional trauma to great effect and realism mention must also be made of justin timberlake again showing some real acting talent where this guy came from i have no clue but hopefully he will continue taking more films and steer away from the mostly crap music he churns out while not as solid and consistent as hustle and flow moan still ranks equally to it in my mind because when it is on it is spectacular towards the end we have a truly enthralling sequence with this little light of mine singing out and earlier the interaction between captive and captor when the chain is first introduced shows some top notch work the truly magical moment though is when jackson sings yes that is him throughout like it was terrence howard in hustle the titular song while a thunderstorm roars and the lights flicker if i don t see a more beautifully shot sequence all year i won t be surprised what these two people do for each other is wonderful and shows what humanity is capable of one thing i think i really enjoy with brewer s work is the fact that he doesn t show sinners becoming redeemed heroes instead he shows us that no matter how bad you have been or how bad life has been everyone can strive for redemption and to be better people we don t have saints here but fallible people looking to right their ship if the course stays true or if it falls back into darkness no one really knows but at least they can say that they tried as hard as they could,1
3051,my wife and i both remembered this film being a lot better than it is when we rented it last weekend we wondered if we were watching the same movie we had seen 22 years or so ago we both agreed that we were probably remembering the tv series which in its one hour segments was compelled to actually wrap up plot lines this movie leaves many loose threads as has been mentioned by others here basically every main character s story line is left unresolved gotta like the title song though,0
24912,leos carax has made 3 great movies boys meet girls mauvais sang les amants du pont neuf in fact those films were not that great but it has the violence of youth the beauty of juvenile wilderness carax in these three movies was well aware of what cinema was but he tried to make his own vision of the art without thinking about about all he have seen but using it and melting it into his times pola x is a very different movie because carax made les amants du pont neuf a monstruosity of 20 millions dollars a film that has destroyed everything on its way after such a movie you can t do another one in the same point of view so leos carax has to changed and he did the movie isn t as beautiful as its first it s more reasonable no more studio no more dreamed paris carax has entered at last reality it s not clean anymore it s not poetic characters carax have become a romantic in the german sense of it,1
18891,the cast was well picked pauly shore is hilarious and does a good job of bringing the plot of the movie together however tiffani amber thiessan is who really makes this movie special her talented acting combined with her great looks makes this movie a definite see,1
20787,the regard of flight written and performed by bill irwin is a true classic theatre piece which translated quite well to the small screen full of quick and sparkling dialog and some of the best physical comedy of the decade it is head and shoulders above 99 of comedy as it is presented today i am sure it will one day take its rightful place with such great shows as the fantastiks and waiting for godot why it isn t available on dvd yet is a mystery and a tragedy,1
20940,if you haven t seen this yet you really should on dvd i can t believe how much i enjoyed it it is amazingly realistic and believable true much of it is speculated and i would have liked to have known more about what was speculative and what were proven facts there aren t many of them but it handles everything quite well with a cruel mother nature theme it will remind you of the nature programs that you ve seen on animal planet and the discovery channel only the animals here are dinosaurs they act natural they eat kill mate play and fight for survival you will actually find yourself rooting for some of them and against others for the most part the effects are excellent at times they will look a little too much like cgi s but then you will see them in a different angle that makes them look more realistic in some cases you will actually be convinced that you ve seen a dinosaur my favorites were the coelophysis the raptors the diplodocus the iguanadons the allosaurus and the arctic bipeds i was most disappointed with the t rex however which looked a little too computer generated at times in any case you should definitely see this production it is educational well made and very entertaining for what it is its an a,1
523,l auberge espagnole is less funny and less interesting than any episode of dobie gillis where is their bob denver do they even have a dwayne hickman a french man moves to barcelona to attend classes he moves in with some other students who are no more interesting than himself and they do and say uninteresting things this movie is unbelievably bland the only bright spot was a pretty french girl who played a belgian lesbian she places her hands behind her head and reveals shaven underarms not the usual tufts of dark smelly hair but bare armpits does not a good movie make l emmerdeur was funny so was la cage aux folles l auberge espagnole and le placard makes you wonder what is going wrong with french comedy,0
671,i ve seen some terrible book to film adaptations in my day but this one tops them all the bizarrely unattractive cast detracts from the story which is in itself untrue to the book mr tilney is nothing like handsome as for catherine morland a rat like appearance makes this heroine a difficult one to sell to a sympathetic audience isabella is nothing like the aphrodite one reads about in the original text and james morland appears in the film far too little to leave the viewer with any understanding of his important role in the story also as others have pointed out before this novel was intended to satirize the gothic craze prevalent in austen s time but it appears that this soft horror film was designed and meant to be taken seriously i m sure jane austen turns over in her grave each time one of her fans is disappointed by this awful interpretation of what was supposed to be a joke,0
9555,this movie was so frustrating to watch the split screens don t allow you to get very involved in the emotions of the actors i was constantly going back and forth watching all these tiny images that i found myself with wiplash by the end this is basically a rip off of the talented mr ripley and timecode i was very let down with this film makers attempt to be cool i wish i had walked out like so many other people did,0
22596,although i m not a golf fan i attended a sneak preview of this movie and absolutely loved it the historical settings the blatant class distinctions and seeing the good and the bad on both sides of the dividing line held my attention throughout the actors and their characterizations were all mesmerizing and i was on the edge of my seat during the golf segments which were not only dramatic and exciting but easy to follow toward the end of this movie seabiscuit came strongly to mind although the greatest game ever played is far less complex a story than that film in both cases the fact that the events really happened deepened my interest,1
18824,not a larry mcmurty masterpiece but it stands on its own as a good western any of the lonesome doves do who ever takes on the role of woodrow call does a great portrayal in their own style it s also easy to see that they were looking to use this as a stepping stone to the t v series both version of it and that the writers knew how to keep the flavor alive william peterson was awesome in this the geeky c s i guy is not the character he plays in this this guy can do it all it seemsit s deserve to be enjoyed by those who enjoy westerns4out5 stars,1
5854,if you thought herbie trying to kill himself by driving off a bridge in the love bug was daft wait till you see him acting horny in this bewilderingly silly second sequel dean jones is back as the driver who competes in the paris to monte carlo rally this time his sentient vw falls in love with another car in the race a lancia driven by julie sommars by this point in the series the energy and charm is lacking even more than in herbie rides again the movie is overlong and threadbare although it s watchable thanks to the return of jones s typically likable performance a few funny bits and the cast s frantic mugging,0
24695,i thought it was terrific very realistic and funny dialogue and realistic action in a newsroom i didn t like how the jennifer storyline is not really concluded or how the ending doesn t give us closure holly hunter fit the part perfectly she s one crazy actress this movie is well worth seeing,1
20771,this little known comedy from the hit play by ruth gordon is a delight the script based on the play is spicy rich and completely undated ditto the cast but i must underline the work of the leading lady irene dunne irene is simply superb as usual and lights up the screen with every frame she s in and she s in it a lot thank heaven in addition director vidor has given her some unusual close ups that are mesmerizing what a gal i know of no other hollywood actress from any era who has her versatility and is so convincing in every film why she remains so little known is a mystery i have seen most of her films and this one was a surprise even for a solid id fan like myself see it everyone,1
301,i ve got 10 plus year old computer games with better special effects plot is choppy and very predictable most of the actors seem like extras with no experience everyone has scottish accents it s like watching a crew of scotties from star trek without the personality or charm needless scenes of people putting up tents tents with all of the supposedly high tech equipment actors looking like they were not sure the camera was on them nothing to make you care if these people survive or not looks like it was made in someone s backyard and garage using low end equipment nothing seems original or even slightly entertaining do not waste your time,0
3756,i was totally disgusted with this unnecessary sequel to the poseidon adventure a movie which i have given a great comment about this film is unbelievable from the word go i agree why were no other rescues boats around and helicopters the one that rescued the original survivors had just flown over the boat that michael caine sally field are on that was the only rescue crew hard to believe the acting is generally poor and the show looks cheap i really hated the waste of talent from some good actors don t watch this film unless you must catch sally michael as lovers gord,0
10882,i went into this movie with an open mind i had been too lazy to go to the video store to pick out a movie and my friend returned with this i promised him i wouldn t laugh at his choice but within the first five minutes i told him i would have to take back my promise we kept watching just hoping it would get better but no a continual mind rape followed this movie was probably one of the worse ever committed to film and surely deserves a place on the imdb bottom 100 i really don t know how this got distributed the lighting was poor i have seen better acting in elementary school plays there is really nothing positive to say about it,0
8527,mr kennedy should stop experimenting with bad movie scripts what was he thinking this is a movie that should not have passed the hey i ve got an idea let s make a sequel stage of inception if there was a zero rating i d give it but i guess i ll settle for a generous 1 it seems these days that if there is a buck to be made movie execs will dig up an old hit and run it by a set of writers and see what turns up hey i said hit and run kinda describes how i felt when this movie ended how this piece of trash ever saw the light of day is beyond me it is filled with unpleasant humor strange animation and jokes that don t quite take you anywhere besides a state of confusion if you are being dragged to this movie and someone is paying for you fine but its still going to be more painful than a brick in the forehead however if you re planning on paying your own hard earned money search out a better alternative,0
13550,i am so excited that greek is back this season looks really eventful im glad that casey is trying to get serious about school but is still involved in the sorority its really funny that she wants to go into politics that they re highlighting her scheming talent i loved calvin s new haircut it makes him look more mature they should shave cappy s head as well all the guys are hot but calvin is definitely the hottest i cant wait to see more of him i m especially interested in what happens between calvin adam rusty i also love rebecca she s really pretty i actually think that rebecca calvin should hook up go for it calvin join my team,1
15830,wow an amazing lost piece of australiana and a lost 70s glam rock film rolled into one this film warrants viewing simply to see what can be done with next to no budget but a lot of enthusiasm as a retelling of the oz story the film borders on becoming too obvious but it is saved by it s eccentricities the chance for a glimpse at how glam rock manifested in australia will delight fans of the genre this film used to be double featured with the rocky horror picture show an indicator of the type of film that oz is while not as frivolous or well constructed as rhps it s hard not to have fun with oz surprisingly oz has aged well perhaps a by product of how determinedly set in the real australia of 1976 it is the passage of history shows that many of the ideas being explored would eventually enter the mainstream the willingness of the film to give prominence to gay characters is notable especially as it dates to the revolution period for the australian gay rights push the performances range from flinchingly amateur to finely nuanced brilliance the direction is lacking in subtlety and much of the dialogue may have benefited from an extra draft or two somehow these flaws add to the appeal of the film which is mercifully unpretentious much like australia in the 1970s this film has a certain naive charm there are several connections to the original australian stagings of the rocky horror show which will keep obsessives on their toes oz is most certainly a minor classic and a potential cult favourite worthy of review laugh at the atrocious 70s fashion swing along with the ausrock soundtrack leave any expectations at the door and oz is likely to delight,1
11625,just awful it s almost unbelievable that with characters and situations provided by dashiell hammett such a plodding passionless mishmash could result but that s television for you filler between commercials the first warning signal sounds from the fussiness of the period re creation which screams 1928 in banner type flivvers and touring cars fedoras and waistcoats cloches and speakeasy jazz jarringly played with all the attention paid to pointless arty detail the important matters get ignored like narrative clarity or plausibility or competent writing and acting the plot sets one of hammett s operatives hamilton nash so whether he s called ham or nash we think of hammett or dash investigating a bogus diamond theft thus is introduced the young woman who supposedly carries the dain curse the charmless and talentless nancy addison who went back to soaps where she belonged she belongs to a crackpot religious cult led by jean simmons and seems addicted to drugs as well there s also a mysterious gaseous drug which seeps into rooms but enough the writing is never more pedestrian than when it reaches for the poetic or high flown and the cast parrots it the only way they know how by grotesquely overacting simmons gets treated like minor royalty from old hollywood but the grande dame treatment doesn t wash hector elizondo for some reason enjoys second billing after coburn for a dispensable part other familiar faces drift through doing little good for their resumes the actors aren t even photographed to look good jason miller is an especial fright but extreme close ups of coburn are pitiless too coburn probably copped this role because with mustache he bears a strong resemblance to hammett he needed more guidance than that nobody has given him the vaguest hint as to how to play his character or of the story s tone or of how the different strands of the plot mesh together they don t at least not in this telling so he flashes his big chesire cat grin whether called for or not the dain curse is available on videotape in a variety of lengths for those foolhardy enough to see for themselves the shortest abridgement is the kindest cut of all,0
19757,this is definitely a must see film the excellent director alain chabat also acting as ceasar has managed to capture the very essence of the adventures of ast rix the french comic books it s based upon and to create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy which is also an homage to the world of animated films this movie is so funny so full of jokes both visual and spoken that it might take you two or three screenings before you notice them all between your bursts of laughter the only drawback is that a non french audience or at least a non french speaking audience might not get all the private jokes there are so many dialogues impossible to translate so many situations directly related either to the comic books or to the french way of life that the fun might be lessened however it s still totally worth seeing for the beautiful picture the amazing stunts the music the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent acting all actors are great but the film would not be the same without jamel debouze g rard darmon and edouard baer and please don t ever compare this magnificent film to the terrible previous one based on the same comic books ast rix et ob lix contre c sar and directed by claude zidi,1
18450,jean dujardin gets connery s mannerisms down pat the adjusting the cuff links when entering a club as all the women turn to admire him the nonchalant straightening and smoothing down of the tie the swaggering steely gait it s uncanny and you come to realise just how much of bond in the sixties was connery s creation and not really ian fleming s character the cinematography is a nod to those early films the movie takes off from russia with love and thunderball mainly the main joke is how chauvinistic the hero is not just in terms of sexism but nationalism and colonialism and how he puts noses out of joint when he is sent to egypt it s not perfect about 20 mins in it seems a one joke movie and bits of it remind one of spoofs of the day of which there were plenty morcecambe and wise s the intelligence men had suspect looking men in fez s following their heroes around too and that s going back a bit unlike sellers clouseau or baron cohen s borat dujardin doesn t give his character that layer of realness or genuine pathos he is too busy perfecting his connery mannerisms it doesn t do enough with the credits or a big song and there s no funny or serious villain like mike myers dr evil or ricardo montalban s naked gun nemesis for the hero to go up against but the scene where oss117 wakes up in cairo one morning had me laughing out loud in the three quarters empty cinema and the whole thing looks wonderful plus you ll never get a chance to see operation kid brother on the screen and the women are ace crumpet really hot it s a bond spoof without falling into the mad scientist ken adam sets or funny gadgets routine throughly recommended,1
13884,glorifying not glamorizing world war ii we ve had quite a few documentary series about world war ii on the regular television programming without looking up any information in some encyclopedia or film book it seems that this old memory can recollect most names entirely on it s own there was crusade in europe which was the title of the war memoirs of one general of the army and later the 33rd president of the united states of america dwight d eisenhower it told the story of the conflict in europe as viewed by the supreme allied commander then there was a crusade in the pacific subject matter self explanatory which i don t remember much about newspaper man author jim bishop was the host navigator of battleline and there was the excellent winston churchill the valiant years the series was a co production of the british broadcasting corporation and the american broadcasting company it first aired in 1960 61 season here in the states and boasts of having richard burton s speaking the words of sir winston it is the 1952 nbc television network s production of our subject matter today this victory at sea that wins the cigar hands down to begin with this had to have taken the production several years of carefully and literally sorting through thousands of hours of film the movie footage referred to here was the official filmed record taken by members of the armed forces of the united states independent newsreel film motion picture record of our other allied partner nations as well as captured axis pictures from nazi germany fascist italy and imperial japan once that was accomplished the various corresponding film had to be cut and edited into a series of 1 2 hour installments this was done with great skill being that there were so many scene changes whether done abruptly or as a dissolve the look of ever episode appears as smooth as if it had been a single motion picture project the writing of the spoken word to accompany this finest of real life film was no less amazing and unique the highly polished and meaningful eloquence wastes not a word and at times even understates the description of action rather than exaggerating it the narration goes to mr ralph graves who was a talented actor of stage film radio and television he certainly gained a measure of immortality by way of his golden toned voicing of the written episode descriptions lastly victory at sea enjoys the luxury of having an original score both opening theme and incidental music penned by richard rodgers of broadway fame rodgers hart rodgers hammerstein his compositions are intricate full variable and even classic in the true sense the classical arrangement was played by the nbc sympphony orchestra under the direction of robert russell bennett and as a soundtrack record cassette tape compact disk it has been continually available and in demand ever since its first release 55 years ago and really small wonder for it is this musical score that is so mesmerizing to the viewer listener it truly puts the frosting on this cake sir winston churchill the valiant years also had a beautiful and highly memorable original score this also was composed by mr rodgers we had in additional ace in the hole in our house in the person of our father the late clement j ryan 1914 74 dad had been in the u s navy during the war being inducted in 1943 or 44 our pop was always on hand to explain and further elucidate any of the situations that were depicted in the series he and our mother the now 90 year old bertha nee fuerst ryan already had my older sister joanne 1942 90 as a dependant,1
125,it seems ever since 1982 about every two or three years we get a movie that claims to be the next officer and a gentleman there has yet to be one movie that has lived up to this claim and this movie is no different we get the usual ripped off scenes from oaag i want you dor the instructor gives the richard gere character his overdose of drills in hopes he ll quit the gere character comes back for the girl the gere character realizes the instructor is great etc and this movie is as predictable as the sun rising in the east and is horribly miscast on top costner plays his usual wise teacher character the only character he can play and you really get a sense of his limited acting abilities here kutcher is terrible in the richard gere character just miscast with acting skills barely a notch above keanu reeves the main problem with this oaag wannabe is the two main characters are so amazingly one dimensional you never care for either in the least and when kutcher s character finally turns around just like gere did in oaag you just go so what the movie leaves no plot point unturned and seems to never end as if to say oh wait we forgot to close out the girlfriend story or the what happens after he graduates story or the other six plot points in the movie what s more baffling is the great reviews i see here the general public s opinions never cease to amaze me,0
12309,just to let everyone know this is possibly the worst movie i have ever seen and i ve seen pretty much everything if you re thinking of renting it don t it s not worth the cardboard container that it came in,0
19292,note i saw i sell the dead at the glasgow international film festival on 20th january 2009 i sell the dead is a jet black horror comedy set in late medieval times and stars dominic monaghan lost lord of the rings ron pearlman hellboy larry fessenden session 9 and angus scrimm phantasm the movie opens with grave robber willie grimes fessenden still indignant and unremorseful being dragged to the guillotine and executed his apprentice and partner in crime arthur blake monaghan is locked in the tower awaiting his turn when father duffy perlman a whiskey swilling priest with an unhealthy interest in the occult pays him a visit with the apparent intention of recording blake s final confession it soon becomes apparent however that duffy main interest lies in the more otherworldly side of blake s exploits most of the plot from here is told in flashback form as monaghan regails duffy with tales of his macabre career initially grimes and blake start out as simple wise cracking body snatchers working in the employ of the ghoulish dr quint scrimm a callous corrupt anatomist who uses blackmail as leverage over our two anti heroes and takes a rather unhealthy relish in his work the pair have their first run in with the undead when one evening quint sends them on a mission to a bleak moonlit moor to retrieve a corpse that has been mysteriously interred at a crossroads apparently according to some ancient custom but there s something different about this corpse this one has been wrapped in cloves of garlic and buried with a stake through it s heart following a terrifying encounter not only do they devise a plan to rid themselves of the scheming doctor s machinations but they also uncover a secretive subculture of occultists who will pay good money for corpses and even better money for living specimens of the undead this leads our intrepid duo into the hidden underworld of the ghoul hunting trade where they find themselves going head to head not only with vampires monsters and zombies and one other paranormal entity for which i will not spoil the surprise but also rival ghoul hunters in the form of the inbred and murderous murphy clan i went into i sell the dead expecting a low key mildly distracting low budget chiller i was not prepared for the incredible imagination giddy humour quality acting great dialogue thick atmosphere and sheer personality that makes i sell the dead a strong early contender for my horror film of the year with the exception of a couple of rough edges the production values are truly fantastic for such a low budget flick it looks like it was made for about 20 million and i was surprised when the director told the audience it was made for significantly less than half of that although he was unwilling to give exact figures as the film was still being sold to distributors the look and tone of the film is a visual comic book somewhere between tim burton and hammer horror with smart little creepshow esquire artwork inserts the plot is wonderfully surreal but the idea of a hidden underworld running parallel to everyday life but which the general populace is either unable or unwilling to believe in is one that actually makes quite good sense within the context of the film the acting as you d expect from this cast is top notch the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violin playing anatomist doctor quinn conclusion i loved it it s a long time since i was so entertained by a movie i struggle to find anything bad to say about it mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line,1
3446,the movie contains a very short scene of deneuve in a bathtub she looks absolutely stunning for a lady age 56 but this is the only saving grace of the movie otherwise it has a mindless unmotivated script and the lead actress has none of deneuve s appeal the director apparently watched too many peter greenaway films and pola x comes across as a student s imitation of the greenaway style without any of his inspiration,0
9860,caligula shares many of the same attributes as the 1970 fellini satyricon with bizarre sights freakishness and depictions of sexual excesses all set in the glory of ancient rome but fellini it ain t first of all it is not as entertaining far too much screen time is devoted to bug eyed rubber faced mcdowell in the titular role his performance is far too fey and campy to be convincing the portrayals by jay robinson in the robe 1953 and david cain haughton in emperor caligula 1983 are far more persuasive and believable with the latter being the most nuanced relief could have been judiciously provided by developing the surrounding characters more fully as it is they are little more than cyphers one example is the role of macro played by guido mannari who has tremendous screen presence in an important role but is mostly left in the background the only positive features to credit are the adroit use of some prokofiev and stravinsky themes in the music score and the inclusion of some of the distasteful but nevertheless accurate actions of the despot these two factors are far less than what is needed to relieve the prevailing tedium however,0
11805,since wesley snipes descended or ascended to the world of dtv action movies the result has been miss so so and miss unstoppible was weak 7 seconds was entertaining the marksman was the proverbial scraping of the septic tank and what of the detonator we ll anything would be above suffering the marksman again but the detonator holds a small amount of merit that is hampered by a lazy star and low budget sonny griffith is a not so by the book covert op who busts illegal arms dealers in poland when his latest assignment ends up a bullet buffet leaving a pile of bodies sonny then is ordered to escort a witness nadia the ever hot silvia colloca to the us trouble is sonny is being duped by a traitor in his own organization who is keeping his trail hot for gangsters with nuclier ambitions snipes delivers in the action department he is in half blade mode here he actually does well in the first 15 minutes of the detonator before descending into pure sleepwalking mode that ruined the marksman colloca does more than look pretty there is some conviction to her scenes a lot of the actors look familiar and have been in the last 3 or 4 seagal snipes movies its always good to see michael brandon again the action is telegraphed here but never boring running car chases fights director po chih leong seems to have gotten better after the seagal farce out of reach he does a credible job but is constantly hampered by the low budget enough with the eastern euro locations its cheapening the movie s look vancover cannot be that much expensive can it the detonator ends just average it does not have the so bad its fun aspect of seagal mercenary for justice but it is nowhere near as entertaining as van damme s second in command nor as thrilling as dolph s mechanik perhaps dolph should direct wesley next eh its high time the producers pump a little more money and thought into these dtv titles with the kind of money they are making from them its only fair the result could be a high seller perhaps snipes would be advised to try making this one his last dtv action flick its sad to see yet another waste of this gifted actor s talents,0
5172,had i known to what i was submitting myself i would have fled from the theater the film is dreadful in the literal sense of the word despite striking images intriguing locales and a subject matter that might have been fascinating the film is dead i was unfamiliar with this period of greek history and prepared to experience a great film the filmmakers s hand is heavy it is not enough to see a train going by we must watch it from afar we must watch it car by car we must see the smoke we must see it slow down and we must see it stop the director s approach is didactic likewise the characters that he creates never develop they never change they are so stereotypic that we wonder are they meant to be everyman everygirl everyoldmusician is there some point to this allegory it is the most pretentious film that i have seen in a long while,0
18861,well where do i start as one of the other reviewers said you know you re in for a real treat when you see the opening shot minutes and minutes of film time spent on a guy standing on a travelator i won t repeat rubin s excellent summary of the story what i would like to say though is that this film gripped me more than any film i can remember i sat open mouthed and on the edge of my seat all the way through the camera work sound track and fantastic performances particularly that of tony servillo draw you to the screen and won t let you look away it s italian so of course everyone looks fantastic but it is by no means merely an exercise in cool style this is a film with lots to say about luck loss and love go and see it,1
825,lately i ve been watching a lot of westerns from the 1930s to the present there are some great low budget spaghetti westerns from the late 1960s and early 1970s this movie had all the elements of a decent western a good story with talented actors and everything else although it s a spoof of this genre and for me the way it was done just didn t work and made for a disappointing movie this movie can easily be divided into two parts the first part is great it has a great opening scene and an interesting story develops of a bounty hunter a k a the stranger going after a bandit who is going after a large bank shipment guarded in part by a banker over the course of the movie these three characters form shifting alliances in an attempt to get the money there are subtle comic nods to the contrivances of earlier films from this genre but the comedy doesn t disrupt the overall story the second half of the film is where the comedy goes over the top and essentially ruins the movie the turning point is right at the part where the barmaid causally scolds the dwarf to stop shooting the customers as she goes about waiting on other patrons seemingly oblivious to the four dead bodies laying about the place from this point onward the movie shifts from a decent spaghetti western with comic undertones to a stupid silly spoof there are three horrible fist fight scenes one at the river one in the market and one at the baths that follow in rapid succession as if one wasn t bad enough the fighting is so fake it s ridiculous and since the sound is out of sync with the picture it makes it even worse in the market fight scene the banker bounces about the place on hidden trampolines and twirls around on poles like he is in the circus it s clownish although the worst part of these fight scenes is the music it s this light hearted sprightly mix more suited for a square dance or a cheesy episode of hee haw these scenes practically derail the main story overall this movie was disappointing because it had a lot of potential as a decent western but the comic turns just mucked it up if you want to see a good western spoof then see blazing saddles if you want to see a good spaghetti western then avoid this movie,0
15457,i saw this film when it was released to the minor cinemas in the uk some 50 years ago and the memory remains of a great musical score and the tragedy of the storyline i saw it again on video recently the sound track was poor and the picture grainy but it is one of two films that i saw again the next day the other being gladiator the music theme is intensely tragic and from the outset one knows that it heralds failure or death certainly one of george sanders best performances as a man working the black market to get pay back for what he lost in the war but nemesis waits patricia roc plays a refugee from eastern europe eaten with despair he is attracted to her selflessly wants to help her and then falls in love with her but she is too proud and hurt to accept help their love destroys him and inevetably the girl and the doctor herbert marshall who brought the nemesis the storyline is of complex intertwining destinies where subsidiary characters are not who they appear to be this is as a film which diappointed the critics and struggled at the box office but for the adolescent who saw it and the retired gentleman who saw it again it is one of the greatest films taking into account its age whose story is more akin to an opera,1
20397,the beguiled is a pretty satisfying film for those who are after the things above for clint eastwood s die hard fans it will be a disappointment although eastwood does his best here in his so atypical role except for the fact that his character is a charming womanizer which he isn t so unacquainted with the ambiguous nature of his character which goes from being a sort of fallen hero to a manipulative and insatiable woman eater to put it that way will eventually be too much to handle for anyone used to see him play heroes in the best western tradition morally a bit unclean but still without that dark side i think he manages to pull this unlikely part off but those who really steal the show are the two rivalising women the schoolmistress geraldine page and the head of the students played by elizabeth hartman we see that there is a potential devil in every man and a potential witch in every woman especially when it comes to sexuality and sexual desire hartman s edwina is the sweetest most innocent girl in the world until she becomes infatuated with john mcburney and becomes possessive of him this is what causes tragedy as well as the headmistress secret lust the forbidden fruit she carries a great and ugly secret about her incestuous relationship with her brother whom she clearly idolizes still the fourth factor in this unholy love spiral is the wicked carol played by jo ann harris who lures john away from his crush on edwina and into her bed the whole nature of the story gives this film a sort of gothic feel which makes it a pretty rare thing in the western genre but a popular thing in the movies of the 70 s a unique achievement by the siegel eastwood team and a movie not for the faint hearted,1
7489,i d picked this one up time and time again in the rental store wondering if i should give it a shot today i broke down and gave it a whirl and i probably shouldn t have while the writer director did give the film a respectable effort it fell far short of engaging the characters while you wanted to feel for them just didn t have enough development or depth for you to get truly involved with them sara s sexual outbursts got tiring fast i don t mind sex in films and i don t mind bitchy characters but being a bad girl doesn t mean you re prone to excitedly ask people at random if they d like sexual favors by the time what happened to the characters was revealed i was bored and ready to fast forward to the climax the end anything exciting and nothing delivered the things the folks in the story eventually inform you of seems forced and unrealistic and just wasn t played quite right if they d have thrown a bit more anguish in there i might have been interested this should have been a more of a suspense drama film and should have stuck to the title jon good s wife rather than the whole red right hand and horror film like cover hell this should have had suspense period either way watch this on a rainy day or a late night when there s nothing on the television though this isn t as great as i d hoped i would go for this over some infomercials,0
16223,i just thought i would add another observation here while there are a couple of visual sub references in this episode to the possibility of unexpressed feelings between jim kirk and yeoman janice rand there is a special physically tender moment toward the end when the enterprise is reversing at emergency warp speed in an attempt to outrun a possibly fatal romulan plasma ball janice perhaps fearing that their life is about to come to a dramatic end seeks comfort by placing her head on jim s sympathetic shoulder as they observe the aproaching instrument of their impending doom on the main viewer i thought it was sweet and janice of course is gorgeous p s goof several times while supposedly firing phasors the film shows photon torpedoes being launched,1
23002,the piano teacher is all about huppert s character a middle aged classical piano instructor with a stoic facade behind which lurks a powerfully compelling aberrant personality unsatisfying as a story but intriguing as a character study the film follows the huppert character through the term of her anguished relationship with a pupil delivering superb performances in the process not for everyone the piano teacher will play best with those into foreign films and character driven dramas dealing with dark issues a,1
20119,i love this movie so much it always makes me cry if you appreciate drew barrymore half as much as i do you ll love this movie it s got all the essentials i look for in a movie it has good actors good characters good humor a lot of heart warming moments too the flash back moments when we see josie in high school make me cry though every single time i m sure you ll like this one don t judge based on the fact that it looks like a teen movie even though it is in a way a teen movie sure if you re a guy and all you watch are hardcore special effect movies only in the top 250 movies of all time then this isn t for you but if you like romantic comedies you will not forget after seeing it pick it up at a video store and enjoy drew barrymore is great in this one,1
8792,boy oh boy does this movie stink this movie is one of the worst pieces of trash i have ever seen in my whole entire life please even if your life depends on it do not and i repeat do not under any circumstances view this horrid piece of garbage only watch this thing when it comes on as a mst 3000 episode that was the only way i could sit through the whole thing if i had to watch it without that show i would ve stopped watching it before it was over it does have one use a cure for insomniacs,0
11185,this review contains a spoiler the movie is an american ninja mysteriously trained in the martial arts he falls for the colonel s daughter and turns from the most hated grunt on the post to the people s hero at the end of the film this film is extremely cheesy and very poorly researched it is good for folks who do not care about plot development or reality good for kids under 14 the military errors in this film is comical i remember during my three years in the military us privates were not required to salute or call nco s sir the film does this in various spots the colonel s hair is way too long on the ears the master sergent s moustache was against military protocol in length on the post the colonel was the only officer around not one other officer was shown walking around the post you had idiot ninjas brandshing swords against troops with m 16 s rather poorly made folks this filmed reeked michael dudikoff is not really that bad of an actor he just has lousy scripts the ninjas were more hilarious than dangerous avoid this film,0
19262,well not much really to say about this but it is really good very good job from softley directing and the movie have good cast of acting movies plot is also believable and hehe good so the good is main word in this case i just hope there would be more this kind scifi movies thats why this one s pointed out in the crowd i give it 8 5 of 10,1
7992,would somebody please explain why anybody would want to make a british neo noir crime film with a cast almost entirely american the accents spoken in this film are bloody awful but entirely in keeping with the performances which are so wooden one fears to strike a match for setting the cast on fire really what kind of disgusting moronic cynical crud is this even neo noir films have some character you either feel for or want to feel for even if they re wretched and doomed they at least have some decency to them some sense that what they ve done is wrong or that a seemingly good plan has gone wrong and that somehow they re stuck with the responsibility for it not in this stanky stew these characters are putrid betraying each other themselves and the audience also note that they are low lives all right nothing wrong with that except that they seem to be living a life of luxury for a film supposedly about desperate petty thieves the keynote here is ennui it s all so terribly dull and dross doncha know so let s just rip some people off or maybe murder them and go get laid in a luxury hotel what ambition gooping this whole mess to some bottom of swampy muck are boringly uneven pacing predictable action sequences that aren t banal and incoherent set design made for bad tv camera work and editing forgettable score and an entire lack of any imagination or innovation in production and direction wholly unbelievable unlikeable and for less dedicated movie watchers or masochists like myself utterly unwatchable there are other nasty things i would like to say about this nasty film but they wouldn t print them here suffice it to say you can probably find something more useful to do with your time than watch this film just about anything in fact,0
4673,i remember thinking that due to the cast the subject matter and the director i was going to love this movie stepping into the theatre and taking my seat i was like a giddy schoolgirl as my anticipation for the opening scene built i was not disappointed with the opening and felt that i was truly going to love this movie if you haven t seen the movie and feel that anything that gives away scenes might be seen as a spoiler please stop reading i m not going to give away anything really important but it might be seen as such so that is the warning spoiler may be included below beware i think that the first scene that really hit me as just utterly ridiculous was the russian space station scene i mean honestly refueling a shuttle with no real prior warning and then to simply show the station as being so fragile that a simple little mistake can cause the entire thing to just explode while all of this is possible it seemed to me to be way over the top i m not sure if it was just the situation or if it was the cheesy acting the silly view of the russian technology or just the campy attitude of the scene itself it only got worse for me after that because then we endure what seemed like 2 hours of constant super loud explosions in space you know that place where there is no sound because it s a vacuum but the coup de grace for me honestly was the gun scene spoiler possibility earlier in the movie we see bruce willis tearing apart their land vehicle the vehicle that they will use to drive around in when they get there and to help them drill when he is told that this is what they will be using he is taking pieces off and complaining about it because much of what s on it is heavy and not required for what they are doing so then as we are wandering onto the asteroids we see that they have opted to add a massive gatling like gun to the vehicles you know standard nasa fare is to have heavy weaponry on all space missions in case you know aliens or something i could have taken the explosive 2 hours the silly russian space station refueling scene the cheesy love scene near the end the bruce willis character being nothing more than most of his other past characters but the steve buscemi going mad and shooting the space vehicle s gun all over the place and causing havoc damage well that threw the entire thing over the top for me save your money and time and avoid this movie if you want a good meteor movie see deep impact if you want a fun space movie with awesome special effects see space cowboys but no matter what avoid this flick,0
11637,badly shot badly edited clumsy dialogue flat characters unsuccessful adaption of a novel it doesn t really get much worse decent acting and good popcorn saved me for this hour and a half felt more like three hours of boredom occasional good one liners david is a dim witted young man who has never recovered from losing his brother at an early age he puts his faith in a chinese philosophy mumbo jumbo video although that doesn t seem to help him much in real life david is a member of a debt collectors gang where every member has an iq below sea level a lacking script along with uncreative shooting and even worse editing make what could have been quite funny incidents of failed debt collecting look like a amateurish homemade reality show david rents an apartment from an elementary school teacher haraldur who by dropping a couple of sentences about his own importance convinces david he is dealing with the most dangerous criminal in iceland a severely lacking script doesn t offer david anything to base his opinion on a couple of scenes showing haraldur doing something that david could have misinterpreted would have done the work the potentials of film as media as opposed to the text of the book this film is based on are not exploited at first david s connection with haraldur raises his status within the debt collectors gang but the prevailing paranoia in the criminal world forces david to show where his loyalty lies the plot of the film is fine but then it is based on the book this could have been a much better film a good screenwriter could have made something of this material sadly that is not the case the acting is generally good p tur j hann is excellent and credible as david eggert orleifsson doesn t get much to work with but does his best with what little material he has ingvar sigur sson and michael imperioli in a tiny role manage alright overall opinion what could have been quite a funny and entertaining film about a dim witted anti hero in a debt collectors gang becomes a boring badly crafted film made after a poor manuscript staring at your toes for an hour and a half would be more enjoyable,0
21007,there are lot of similarities between never say never again and thunderball not only on sean connery but also the story and plot except the actors all other are same like hijacking atomic bombs asking for ransom trafficking nukes in a ship etc only difference are place of occurrence in thunder ball plot it is in bahamas in never say never again it is over north africa and in thunder ball the nato raf itself loads the nukes into plane and in never say never again it is changed by an rouge arm of the axe and air dropped over us and stolen in caribbean almost 99 is same if anybody wants to dispute this they are most welcome,1
6736,hi guys this is my first review and i would had to have picked the worst movie to review as i only watched 5 minutes of it but trust me you could see this movie was going nowhere the acting was deplorable the camera work and lighting looked as though it was shot and run by a pack of 10 year old s no offence to 10 year olds i just couldn t take anymore i got off my couch took the the house of adam dvd out of the dvd player and threw it in the garbage maybe if you are a colin farrell fan this movie may interest you because the character in the movie anthony is a colin farrell look a like but that is as far as it goes he certainly will never have col s acting abilities i gave this movie a rating of 1 awful only because there were no minuses in the drop down list cheers,0
22690,the man who knew too much falls into that hitchcock middle ground that characterized many of his films during the 1950s not a masterpiece of suspense by any means but an awful lot of fun nonetheless james stewart and doris day play a vacationing couple who get caught up in a plot heavy on foreign intrigue the famous climactic scene takes place at a classical music concert where someone is going to be assassinated during a particular cymbal clash in the score the impish hitchcock of course lets us know what that point is so that the race to stop the assassin becomes a nail biting race against the cymbalist so much of this movie reminded me of the 1978 chevy chase goldie hawn comedy foul play that i have to believe that film was inspired by this neither film is a big deal but both are easy to enjoy grade b,1
4636,i just finishing watching goliath awaits that i ordered from my library i remembered it vaguely from years ago and wanted to watch it with my son anyway the movie was less than 2 hours running time and i thought it was much longer when i first saw it the back of the vhs box states that the goliath emtombs a nazi file whose secrets could destroy the free world forever the divers were supposedly on a covert mission to retrieve the demonic document there was nothing even spoken about retrieving this document also the box says that the bestial ship s insatiable boiler feeds on human blood that would make this a horror movie and there was also nothing revealed in the movie about this i can t remember the details when i watched this years ago on tv but could the back of this box actually be true maybe the 3 hour movie revealed more details just wondering if anyone knows anything about this,0
15337,it happens often while growing up a hollywood movie impresses a youth it not only lasts a lifetime but inspire him to study ancient cultures as a career such was the case with the 1954 film entitled the egyptian audience were awed with the sets costumes and great acting of this film so much so other films soon followed in like vain this is the story of a young egyptian boy who was left parent less soon after he was born with such a dubious beginning it is not hard to wonder why he will spend his life asking questions the boy sinuhe sin oh way which means he that is alone edmund purdom grows to manhood and continues asking why even as he graduates from the school of life to become a physician during his formative years he acquires a lifelong friend named kaptah brilliantly played by peter ustinov and horemheb victor mature who raises from a simple officer of the guard to commander of the armies his life offers everything from a quick rise in social status to condemned criminal to outcast a wondering healer and eventually to a station in life he never expected fine acting goes to jean simmons as merit michael wilding as akhnaton bella darvi as the temptress nefer and john carradine as a memorable grave robber tommy rettig plays thoth the son of the egyptian in his final years he that is alone finally discovers the answer he had been seeking all his life which he bequeathes to his son now in the care of his lifelong friend excellent film,1
21468,someone i know said that there was this film called flatliners that was probably up my street i was told about this movie after watching final destination 2 and watching the extra feature about near deth experience i bought the dvd of flatliners at the modest price of 5 pounds got home and watched it and i could not help but smile and feel good wondering how this film hadn t been in my life before the film is about a group of medical students try to see what it s like after near death experience but then there sins come back in reality and can harm them physically acting from kevin bacon and keifer sutherland is great as you would expect from the pair and joel schmacheur made this a great movie like he did with the lost boys this is an edgy and stylish thriller bound to please nay type of film fan,1
3556,this movie is one big stereotype the acting except philbin harrison is awful and the horrid script only make things worse i must agree with another review that the local characters sound ridiculous as a matter of fact so do the caucasian characters 3 stars out of 10 for 1 philbin 2 harrison 3 surf scenes 1 2 out of watch aloha summer and or beyond paradise for hawaii done right especially bp which i found to be entertaining and brilliant,0
23153,ever since midnight cowboy i have been on the lookout for films with dustin hoffman and have mostly not been disappointed ever since kramer vs kramer i have been on the lookout for films with meryl streep and have mostly not been disappointed she gave a superb performance really one of her best in sophie s decision and i lapped her up in out of africa that these two actors came together over 20 years ago for kramer vs kramer was definitely a very good idea the result is an excellent character drama with a theme which is still very relevant in today s society on divorcing everyone has a pretty bad time though the kids seem to suffer most beautifully handled by robert benton in some original directing presenting some memorable scenes even the passageway takes on character and should be included in the cast and as for the breakfast scene with billy justin henry just simply magnificent just how do you get an eight year old to act benton managed it and of course with hoffman there seemed to be good electricity the result is certainly engaging endearing and convincing justin henry s performance must rank among the best 5 or 6 kids performances of all time the best thing once again was the naturalness there was no going over the top so frequent these days this film came up again on the small screen the other night though i have had it in my video collection for years it is still worth watching and paying attention to everything around 7 out of 10,1
7266,savage guns video title is a dirt cheap bottom of the barrel spaghetti western in which the survivor of a massacre hunts the bandits who killed his brother and left him for dead catching up with them in a town controlled by their crooked boss despite plenty of violence this manages to be both dull and colorless with bad characterizations and almost no imagination or humor lead actor robert woods lives up to his name with a wooden and uncharismatic performance that fails to generate any warmth or sympathy whatsoever in other words the viewer never really roots for him despite the fact that he s the protagonist the worst scene in my opinion is the annoying dance hall scene where a woman sings in a heavy and terribly unsexy german accent it was the worst scene in blazing saddles and the worst one here,0
13885,it s nice to see a romantic comedy that does not have the prissy man lead this has solid acting from both male leads and also from the female lead and although the story is a little long and a little clich you cant help but like it i think the story was a little rushed at the end but extending that would have made the story even longer superior to other romantic comedies such as 100 days with mr arrogant and possibly tied with my tutor friend it would make an interesting introduction to korean cinema not as great as my sassy girl but still good,1
14120,guts of a beauty is a bit better than its predecessor guts of a virgin although this film isn t really a sequel in the sense that it has absolutely nothing to do with the first installment i did find beauty to be a little stronger and better put together all the way around than virgin but then again that s not really saying much beauty starts off as a pretty rough and straight faced exploit film a couple of yakuza cats are holding a young woman prisoner and begin gang raping her in pretty brutal fashion as this nastiness is going on the head guy tells the girl that they did the same to her sister and sold her into slavery in africa and that they re gonna do the same to her they then shoot her up with some drugs and rape her some more she somehow gets away and ends up at a clinic where the nurse there listens to her sob story the rapee ends up freaking out from the stress of her prior experience and commits suicide the clinic worker moved by the young lady s story decides to take revenge on the gang by seducing one of the lower level guys and trying to hypnotize him to make him kill the yakuza leaders this whole plan backfires so now ms vigilante clinic worker gets exposed to much the same treatment that our original rapee got only worse some pretty rough butt rape ensues along with the pre requisite gang rape she too is drugged but the drug has a strange side effect on our seemingly hapless victim it turns her into a raging hermaphroditic blood demon no sh t that s what really happens this is when beauty really takes off with some pretty f cking insane kill scenes including a very classy chest burst rape that looks like a cross between alien and a bad porn and my favorite a head engulfed by demon vagina kill complete with demon vagina slime that has to be seen to be believed definitely some promising stuff going on in guts of a beauty but still very disjointed feeling beauty almost feels like two different films being forced together in a non compatible way still i have to give the film credit the rape scenes are very rough and misogynistic and the kill scenes are just totally off the wall a solid 7 10 for another crazy j horror classic,1
154,there are a few scripts like this one floating around hollywood this one is not even close to the best just the first this is all production value no substance but the disney name probably will help it a good idea a wasted opportunity,0
17149,by mistake i ordered a series from the bbc their new version of robin hood very disappointing in comparison with ros terrible costuming and backgrounds while i enjoyed the sheriff who took cues from the nick grace character the rest of the cast left much to be desired as a for instance marion s costuming looked suspiciously like it came from walmart and sir guy well he looked a bit like a character from an outer space movie ros has stolen the spotlight probably forever in the telling of this tale cast costuming story lines scenery filming and soundtrack by clannad are all superb as is evidenced by all the continual feedback some 26 years on ros is a timeless classic my thanks to all who made the series,1
7326,well they sent it on tv between midnight and 2 00 am it seems like the right time to watch it and then go to bed afterwards no it was not really living up to my expectations i think the dogma concept is good because the film then gets closer to what s really happening between the involved characters when you cut all the unnecessary effects and mood making music out but then again this concept requires some interesting action between the characters i cannot say that i know king lear the shakespeare version very well if i had known the play i would probably have been able to predict much of the film well a crisis can bring the best and worst sides of a character on display and we certainly see some bad sides oh yes the paint of civilisation and culture can be very thin and behind this paint you may find an animal if you then compare it with italiensk for begyndere italian for beginners or mifunes sidste sang mifune s last song you see the same but opposite thing a crisis can certainly bring people to view their life in a more constructive way and if you dare do you may win when the film had ended i thought to myself oh that s why i haven t seen it before the film has its own beauty the quality of the work of the cameraman actors etc is good but the script could need something more a plot maybe wouldn t hurt,0
161,i went to see this movie today with hopes that it would involve an at least half intelligent story i was extremely disappointed as it did not the plot and the decisions by the main character were so far fetched i was hoping for a dog day afternoon type movie but instead got something totally unacceptable i actually found myself totally hoping for the hero to be knocked off and i nearly walked out of the theater on several occasions when this should have happened but didn t heist movies are notmeant to be feel good flicks and this one tried to be just that every couple of minutes during the second half of the movie i found myself saying no way without giving the whole story away it revolved around an armored car guard who was financially down and out and whose house was going into foreclosure he was invited in on a heist and accepted only to back down once the action began weak,0
9872,i got encouraged to watch this film because i ve heard good word of it it was supposed to be this thrilling true crime milestone disturbing shocking all that jazz well i am disturbed because i spent money on it and i am shocked that something so god awful actually got released that s about it this is a supposed new look at charles manson s family of insane loser junkies and their murders but if this is a new look then it s probably new as in fresh and totally inept just watching it gave me a headache and i had to give up trying to make any sense of it or even understand just what the director intended it to be i suppose i should say something about the plot but fact is it was so stupid and incoherent that i barely remember if there even was a plot at all there was something about a manson tape delivered to a radio dj or a tv producer then an hour of pointless random footage of the family in 69 then the polanski murders looking like a bad school play and finally some idiotic part about a bunch of skinheads getting drunk and beating the hell out of one another in an alley i kid you not and then it ended thank god don t ask me to make any sense of that i m just recalling what i saw the performances were terrible too and how difficult is it to make a convincing manson get a short skinny scrawny bloke put a dirty wig and a shaggy beard on him there s your manson but this manson doesn t even look right he just looks like uh a bloke in a cheap wig and a glued on santa beard painted black or maybe that s what this film is actually about manson s family didn t make any sense so this film doesn t make any sense either it s symbolic yeah right i m still so angry at spending money on this i stopped my normal lurking on this site and registered just to vote 1 for this film and post this warning that will hopefully prevent others from spending their money on this garbage stay away from it it s not even worth renting ps the recent us tv production helter skelter got bad reviews here but i saw it last month i saw the 1976 original too and let me tell you compared to manson family that new helter skelter is brilliant and flawless and i was disappointed in it that s how bad manson family is it makes a flawed and mostly disappointing tv movie look perfect,0
17448,four daughters introduced john garfield to audiences and that is what is remembered most about this film today unlike some actors who appear in several films before their screen image gels garfield established his immediately with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth and talk of the fates being against him it s actually the story of four girls their widowed musician father claude rains and their various suitors one of whom felix is played by handsome jeffrey lynn he s the one they all have a crush on but he s in love with buff priscilla lane then she meets ne er do well mickey borden who falls for her as well when buff realizes that one of her sisters is in love with felix she leaves him at the altar and marries mickey this is a fairly formulaic story given life and sequels by the acting garfield has already been mentioned but priscilla lane was by far the strongest of the daughters the most interesting and the best actress jeffrey lynn was a fresh and good looking leading man and this film got him off on the right foot with warners however true stardom was not to be like many others of the era he went into the service and when he came out he had a bronze star but not much of a career he later went into television and real estate claude rains is warm and wonderful as the patriarch so popular was four daughters that it inspired four wives and four mothers as well as reuniting much of the cast again in daughters courageous where the actors played different characters very enjoyable a nice remembrance of simpler and probably happier times and a chance to see john garfield in his first film,1
13139,wesley snipes is perfectly cast as blade a half human half vampire known the daywalker he has all their strengths and his only weakness is the thirst for blood since he teamed up with whistler kris kristofferson he has hunted down vampires who have lived amongst us unnoticed for centuries but omnipotent overlord deacon frost stephen dorff is tired of living in harmony with the humans food as he calls them and he plans to waken the blood god and take control of the world this movie is well cast written and directed ensuring the viewer has a thrilling ride from start to finish packed with great fight sequences and slick dialogue blade is certainly more action than horror but it definitely delivers 8 10,1
17049,i don t know why all of the critics say this was a bad movie this is one of my all time favorite movies tommy chris farley and richard david spade are a great match tommy is the stupid one who spent seven years in college finally passing with a d richard is the smart kid who was hated by everyone in school how can you not laugh when the two of them are singing superstar by the carpenters passionatly and all of a sudden the hood pops up in all this is a great movie i recommend it,1
7863,i m sick of the open mind argument i m generally quite open minded but this sort of line is basically made by people who enjoy things that should not be enjoyed you know what there is a reason so many people are disgusted by this and just because someone out there isn t doesn t make it less so there is after all a reason for the existence of the feeling of disgust and no amount of open mind or pushing the envelope should eliminate that feeling otherwise we re no better than senseless living things back to the film another argument is that this film puts women in the roles normally reserved for men which may be why men don t like it but just because it proves revolting for more men than would otherwise doesn t make it great maybe men shouldn t be turned on by what s dominating the movie industry but is the answer for women to do the same maybe if you don t like movies tv and entertainment having so much sexual objectification of women so much violence don t watch them and if you re a director don t make them otherwise some day someone will ask for an open mind when what happened in this movie happen in real life heck some people seem to like it so much,0
21233,this is one of the very best films i ve seen in ages it s right up there with the likes of trainspotting and pulp fiction it just epitomises teenage culture today the soundtrack is absolutely amazing overseen by pete tong it s a must see,1
10921,the trailer for this film promised a new twist on the zombie genre setting it in the old west except it s not the real old west of course it s some sort of future west in a world where some apocalypse has as apocalypses are known to do killed people and subsequently turned them into zombies it s zombie virus time again folks and you know what that means get bitten and become one of them so into this dusty and dead filled world comes a hero he s a bounty hunter getting paid for taking care of zombies it s not exactly clear who is providing the funds but it seems a little cottage industry of zombie hunting has emerged but as the trailer tells us there s a problem they are running out of zombies the only way to keep on earning is to infect new towns and cities with the virus i think that s not a bad idea for a film but unfortunately it takes a lot more than a good idea and a crowd of people pawing at windows to make a good zombie film what we actually get is a clint eastwood clone the actor s even called clint for crying out loud and his hilarious sidekick trying to bag zombies while trailing some still living bad guys to get some big reward the whole subplot about infecting other towns is only mentioned in passing over half way through the film instead there s a lot of western movie clich s poor zombie make up and some world class bad acting really bad the sort that wouldn t even make it onto hollyoaks both hero and villain chomp on cigars quips are thrown people get bitten as the movie lurches to a conclusion the only thing worth wondering is whether it s going to end with the clich of the hero being the only man alive having killed the one he loves or the clich of him turning into a zombie in the final frame it s the first one by the way this film was written and directed by gerald nott it s the only thing he has done and hopefully it will be his last at the start of the film there is a caption that reads nott entertainment at least they got one thing right,0
11411,stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so i am happy to see any of their films ollie is recovering from a broken leg in hospital and with nothing else to do stan decides to visit him and take him some boiled eggs and nuts instead of candy chaos begins with stan curiously pulling ollie s leg cast string and manages to push the doctor billy gilbert out the window clinging on to it getting ollie strung up to the ceiling when the situation calms down stan gets ollie s clothes as the doctor wants them both to leave and he also manages to sit on a syringe accidentally left by the nurse filled with a sleeping drug which comes into effect while he is driving which you can tell is done with a car in front of a large screen filled with some likable slapstick and not too bad although repetitive and a little predictable classic comedy it isn t great but it s a black and white film worth looking at stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the comedians comedian okay,0
23273,i think andrew davies did an admirable job of taking a magnificent book which emulated the pace and styling of a victorian novel and turning it into a moving and entertaining film i m glad i read twice the book first which is usually the case for me i know that one must view a novel and a film as different media and judge them accordingly but still it s often hard to read the original material after a film gives away the best parts i realize that davies is a very good adapter but i wish the producers had chosen a woman to write the screenplay davies as he admits in the commentary that accompanies the film on dvd wanted particularly to emphasis the more scatological bits in the book i certainly enjoyed those on film as in the book but davies missed a half dozen moments that are so excruciatingly painfully tender which he could have incorporated if his sensibility were more feminine i also would take issue with his use of the book s primary symbol the rose as the screenplay was plotted by davies the denouement was inevitable and appropriate but i really think that author waters final nod to the rose symbol was much more interesting and i preferred way the novel let nan come of age than the way davies chose one quick comment about the four actors who essay the primary roles they are all wonderfully talented well except for the singing and dancing perhaps and moreover their physical presences are so much what the mind s eye sees when reading the novel before seeing the film i thought they were all terrific i recommend that any lesbian and anyone who loves good fiction add both the book and the dvd of tipping the velvet to their bookshelves,1
13249,spoilers beautifully photographed slice of life home front wwii love story with norman rockwell paintings in the beginning and end of the movie about how a war hero is not just someone who kills for his country but is also someone who thinks for himself and isn t corrupted by the war propaganda that s constantly drummed into his head washing out of the marine corps marion hedg hedgepeth jan michael vincent is kicked out of boot camp after five weeks and forced to put on a baby blue marine uniform that shows that he just didn t have it to make the corps humilitated and scorned wherever he went as he s going home to st louis and terrified what his family whom his dad was in the marine corps in wwi would think of him in that he couldn t cut the mustard as a us marine hedg stopping in a bar and finds sitting next to him is a marine member of the fearless and deadly marine raiders richard gere whom a admiring hedge buys a beer making conversation with richard hedge is shocked to find out that not only is he being sent back to the pacific theater after all the battles he fought in and combat medals he got but the totally gray hair and mid thirty looking richard is going to be 21 next month that s what being in the marine corps and wwii did to him buying hedge a number of drinks richard takes the drunk baby blue outside and knocks him out taking his baby blues and leaves his impressive us marine uniform with some money in it for hedge to ware as soon as hedge puts on richard s uniform that fits him perfectly he s confronted by this big drunken us paratrooper who calls himself cement head wanting to have a fist fight with the marine raider hedge doing everything he can to avoid trouble is forced by cement head to belt him after he himself cracked two beer bottle over his cement head to get himself warmed up for the big bout between marine hedge and paratrooper cement head hedge incredibly floors the big cement headed buffoon knocking him out cold with one punch i guess the trick is not hitting him in on top of his head a stunned hedge tell his cement heads fellow g i s hitch hiking to this small town of bidwell hedge notices this us military internment camp for japanese americans who are there because their considered a threat to us security it s later in the movie that hedge shows everyone what a real hero he is not who the people in the town think he is by risking his life to save one of the hated japs who mindlessly together with two of his friends escaped from the interment camp where the hell did they think they were going anyway hedge risked his life by saving the scared to death japanese american from drowning in the dangerous rapids outside the town hedge in his actions taught the people of bidwell that not all japs even those who are american citizens are bad and treacherous banzai screaming suicidal kamikazes like they were thought by the newspapers magazines and movies at the time to think that they were hedge strikes up a conversation with the very cute and pretty waitress at the local diner rose hudkins glynnis o connor who s just crazy about him that even hedge at first thinks that it s his uniform not him that impressed her later when hedge admits to rose that he s not what she and her parents think a us marine raider that he is rose had by then gotten to know the sweet and caring washed out marine so well that it didn t matter to her at all what he was supposed to be a marine a paratrooper or a post office worker it was what was inside his heart that really counted the film has a number of touching and beautiful scenes in it between hedge and rose that shows how movies used to be made years ago without all the sex and profanity that we see and hear in movies today that involved two people in love with each other the way the film accurately not phony baloney shows the true feelings of average americans back then in 1943 about the war in general and japanese in particular couldn t have been done in more authentic and accurate as well as good taste baby blur marine does it s best not to be too politically correct in not showing the hero s or leading actors and actresses in the film having the same feelings and ideas back then during wwii as most people have now which would have come across as phony as a three dollar bill to those people watching the film who lived during those historic and momentous times when the film was to take place,1
1986,first i will say that i am going to be as subjective as i can there will be some potential spoilers ahead so beware i hardly ever review movies but this one in particular i felt i had to review this movie final fantasy 7 advent children based off the ultra popular rpg final fantasy vii for the ps1 has been in the works for quite some time after the years of hype and the dozens of trailers none of which i ever saw i had only seen stills this movie got the legions of fans really excited about seeing their favorite characters on the big screen i myself had played and completed the game a few times like any good fan and being such a movie freak i was pretty excited myself so i had thought to myself what could go wrong well the movie started out ok in the first 20 minutes but then things get out of hand as the movie progressed without a doubt this is the best looking cgi animation around but that won t help a weak plot undeveloped characters and over indulgent action scenes here is the story basically these three silver haired nancy boys in leather who have nothing to do with the game are supposedly clones of sephiroth he s the villain of the game who had supposedly murdered all his supposed clones are trying to kidnap all the children for some reason that was not really explained all that well probably to make an army of kids they also center some of the story on some kid named denzel i don t know who this kid is or what his point is he just seems depressed all the time so the sephiroth clones also are involved in some kind of scheme involving some disease called geostigma that only affects the children this disease seems to cause boredom and small amounts of skin discoloration so now cloud must save the day from these guys apparently cloud and his fellow team mates have learned the ability of flight i felt a little insulted that these characters where flying around a city fighting a dragon and landing on there feet all the time maybe if the movie wasn t so over the top then the view relax into it and then they can be amazed by something incredible the real problem of this movie is logic now i know what you are gonna say but it s called final fantasy it should have those ideas in it well that is a foolish way to think the game based itself in some kind of reality and the movie should follow through in that context context and logic in this movie is inconsistent i could explain it all but if i did i would end up writing the screenplay also some scenes in this movie were extremely contrived and trite like when all of the characters from the game show up just in the nick of time for their obligatory screen time so as not to upset the fans they show up do there bit and pretty much have no point in the story if this is too long here is the simpler review the pros the first 20 minutes top notch cgi animation decent action scenes visually stunningthe cons illogical over indulgent action unbalanced action leaves the viewer jaded at the climax weak plot super human characters no suspense the j rock soundtrack score what happened to the orchestra horrible endingbig time spoiler now the ending of this movie really disappointed me they could have had gone the really cool and sweet ending where cloud dies and meets up with aeris in the after life but after the great battle at the end cloud gets shot in the back the kinda wound where the bullet blast out through the chest then cloud has his 100th flashback in the movie and then wakes up in a pool of lifestream now i remember the lifestream in the game but it did not have resurrecting properties if it did they could have brought aeris back to life thus making a completely different story so cloud is brought back to life and everyone has a party and dives into the pool and we have a ultra cheezy hallmark lifetime type moment not that the movie doesn t have it s moments its is worth seeing for its visuals but thats all other than that it s not really a good movie it is strictly for blinded fans of the game not for people who care about plot and character and story telling,0
23879,not really sure what to make of this movie very weird very artsy not the kind of movie you watch because it has a compelling plot or characters more like the kind of movie that you can t stop watching because of the horrifically fascinating things happening on screen although the first time my wife watched this she couldn t make it all the way through too disturbing for her runs a bit long but nonetheless a worthwhile viewing for those interested in very dark movies,1
21304,i was very surprised to learn that goldie hawn won an oscar for this film she seemed very lifeless and completely schooled by the 54 year old bergman in the scenes where they are side by side if it had been written today i think that bergman and the young man ivan would have wound up together ingrid is so much hotter than goldie and the two self absorbed characters played by matthau and hawn would be left out in the cold but it was written at the end of 60 s and feels like plaza suite or barefoot in the park however matthau s one liners hawn s innocence and bergman s classy performance make this quite pleasant to watch,1
18172,i never saw any of john leguizamo s stand up before i watched freak and after seeing it again on hbo comedy recently it was better more enlivening and with things that at the age of 14 i couldn t understand quite before spike lee did a wonderful job directing keeping the visual angle up to par with leguizamo s theatrics and the style of personal storytelling it s substance and style merging together but unobtrusively we get leguizamo s rants about race and sex the bits about sex are classic but a lot of it is about family and what sticks still fresh in my mind is about his father even when things get dark in some of the stories there s something fresh or crazy or random that leguizamo pulls out to get a laugh and it works more often than not if something does fall flat for me at any rate it might be his personality tics here and there but overall it s the kind of fun material that isn t heady but is so true to itself that it stings find it if you can,1
4964,looking and sounding like a cheap porno without the sex this is the first in an impressive string of stinkers from producer or in this case director geoffrey reeve and it s a doozy laughable on just about every level some government agents i think are professionally murdered in amsterdam and a considerably less than charismatic block of wood interpol agent who i assure you is not named louis salinger is sent in to investigate by walking around a lot to ensure the tax dodge financiers get their money s worth for the plane tickets to shoot on location the wannabe hard hitting attitudes to drugs and depiction of prostitution must have looked laughably outdated even before the celluloid dried but the script at least is very obliging in that it explains exactly what s happening regularly in horribly contrived direlogue were you followed oh no of course not no one outside washington even knows you re here yet despite this the plot somehow remains confusing by the time a sinister vladimir putin lookalike priest no less than kronsteen from from russia with love swaggers up to his pulpit to deliver a sermon your brain will have switched off which is unfortunate because you ll miss our hero pinned to the ground during a fight struggling to reach for a plank of wood only to later realise he is in fact sitting on a loaded pistol and him shouting you bastaaaard at his friend s murdered corpse and the leather bound moustachioed go go boys the morris dancing and the hilarious torture sequence all of which provide ample laughs only the climactic boat chase impresses it s an exciting well directed sequence that really has no place in this movie such a glaring anomaly is explained when the credits roll reeve had nothing to do with that sequence thankfully everything goes back to business as usual for the ridiculous spit out your drink twist and warehouse shootout unless such a wretched thing as a geoffrey reeve completist exists and you re one of them i wouldn t bother with this instantly forgettable nonsense,0
9670,i find it amazing that so many people probably poles have voted for this movie giving it such grades mostly tens ok the movie was fine funny but it was nothing special on the other hand the only good thing about kiler is the dialogues rather not comprehensive for non poles screenplay is primitive the acting except for jerzy stuhr as ryba awful it s too much ado about nothing fortunately it s not included in the top 250 p s the sequel kilerow 2 och 2 kilers is on the way and it s just the same story,0
1906,in a sense this movie did not even compare to the novel however it was good to have a visual of what the congo looked like and also the natives if you are not good at visualizing as you read i would never recommend watching the movie rather than reading the book i hardly suggest even watching this film let alone any other films based on this literary work this movie and many others did not fulfill this book one important part that is missing from the movie is marlow s sense of how government of lack of there in africa was forming an early genocide also in the movie marlow and his companions didn t stop and get the note and wood likewise kurtz african mistress knocks marlow out towards the end of the story which has a major influence in the story but was not in the book in the novel kurtz died on the ship however he died in his hut in the movie the fianc s reaction to marlow s interpretation of kurtz last words also differed this movie is only effective if you wish to visualize more clearly the novel,0
11701,i saw this film for one reason the tagline is upset the head and you re dead cracking it s not surprising that this silly horror comedy runs out of steam before the tape is out of the box but it wrings a few laughs from its oddball premise and cast of characters an eagle eyed human radar a huge strongman and a big breasted sexual magnet are all mind controlled by a huge head in a chair who s not happy about his family being blackmailed by a murderous scumbag this looks like being a promising mixture of ham and cheese before it becomes clear that the characters are one joke wonders and the plot is pretty ordinary if you erm ignore the giant head,0
16710,a huge cast gathered for this remake which sadly was a box office failure notwithstanding a great sound track i can t say it was riveting entertainment nor a cure for insomnia nevertheless i enjoyed the film it provided the escape i was after one afternoon a good look for those of us looking for the ideal life albeit a fantasy expect some corny moments few thrills and an occasional laugh,1
24184,on a second viewing this is still a wonderful romance that is in my opinion much better than the film it came paired with on my 2 dvd set the leo mccarey weepie classic an affair to remember yet it seems to have fallen out of favour slightly only a 6 6 rating here on imdb and dismissed by many critics as gooey slush how sad because this is an intelligent romantic drama with very good work by the two leads jennifer jones and william holden if anything the film should be well remembered for the gorgeous colour cinematography and the unforgettable musical score i don t much like valentine s day but it gave me an excuse to watch this movie again and i m glad of it while i still think holden s character death is too heavily foreshadowed taking suspense out of the final scenes this film is very moving and i really enjoy it,1
9352,i know this movie is a low budget horror movie intended for those in favor of shocks and inexpensive gore but even considering that this movie is just too dull filled with an incoherent plot along with awful music and obvious signs that this movie was never finished without giving any spoilers i ll just say that by the final reel things are wrapped up with no explantion at all either by film or narration the girl anitra is real attractive but yet that is not a good enough reason to enjoy this movie if you are a fan of those gore movies from the 60 s and 70 s then you should watch it but be warned that it does not even reach to the usual plateau of these kinds of movies,0
21466,i just watch this move recently on encore channel what a great film a great cast as well flatliners is very suspenseful and unpredictable the movie has a great opening scene by the ocean then to a series of scene establishing the questions about life after death which provide a very strong upfront story involvement therefore nelson played by kiefer sutherland was the first to go through the test to die and come back to life then it s gets very dramatic by bringing back his wrong doing from the past to life then all of the above mentioned characters went through the same experience except for randy steckle played by olliver platt then the story unfold into a resolution and basic understanding about life and the presence and meaning of god david labraccio played by kevin bacon an atheist end up questioning his own belief about god it s amazing to watch julia roberts along with kevin bacon oliver platt william baldwin and kiefer sutherland at such a prime time of their careers one can ask how come we don t have such great movie produced anymore this is one of the best productions from joel schumacher i really enjoy this movie,1
189,this film is an insult to the play upon which it is based the character of claude has been warped beyond recognition leaving a painful performance that does not even vaguely resemble the original plot shame shame shame they have also cut a fair number of the original score of change the context in which the songs are sung this warps the air of the film and causes the viewer who is aware of how this should be to wince as the writer of this screen play gives hud a wife turns sheila into a spoiled rich girl characterizes claude as a cowboy and kills burger by sending him to vietnam instead if one is not familiar with the original plot i assure you this is not a bad film for you to see but if you ever wish to see the original or are as i am a die hard fan of the classic play you would do best to avoid the film altogether one really must stick to one or the other,0
17780,the folks at aardman have done a cool cute and wild adaptation of their short films of wallace and gromit to feature length as the man and his dog inventors who seem to have more of the intelligence or practicality for the latter in this case they ve invented a machine that can capture all of the bunnies that are eating up the crops all over a quiet english village in particular for mrs tottington or totty for those who are intimate much to the chagrin of victor quartermaine who just wants to kill all the rabbits with his trust rifle wallace and gromit seem to have success with their machine but wallace has a mix up a machine he s made to make more food suddenly criss crosses himself with a rabbit the curse is on a lot of this is about as much light hearted fun that a kid s movie could ask for but it also tips its hat to the oldest tradition in classic cartoon slapstick looney tunes which in turn is indebted to much silent comedy and vaudeville granted the aardman guys nick park and steve box have a bunch more gimmicks and tricks and ingenuity with their material it s never less than amazing to see how they put the stop motion to use even when a joke or a gag might be a little on the funny ho ho not funny ha ha side a tired criticism but i ll say it curse of the were rabbit works so well on all fronts for the audience in its warped story and sudden dips into exposition the golden bullet story is a doozy park and box and company never lose sight of glee in the material it s fuzzy and warm hearted and completely off the wall for the kids even the very youngest will love the adventures and strange gadgets such as the truck wallace and gromit drive around in and for adults there s little barbs of funky absurdist tones in the midst of a classic english farce only and i m probably a minority opinion here when compared to chicken run it s almost a little slight a work there s less any plot than there is a series of running gags and of course lots of puns involving bunnies and monsters and carnivals and cheese and horrible men with egos in their guns like the fiennes voiced quartermaine but when it strikes best it s one of the most entertaining films of 2005 it gives me a big goofy smile anytime it s on tv,1
20465,i loved this film it was so intelligent but it also had some great action sequences without basing the movie solely around them quinn sutherland and kingsley all put in fantastic performances and there are enough twists to keep anyone interested the ending was great as well,1
6799,i took my family to see barnyard this past weekend we had so looked forward to it but had my kids not been there my husband and i would have left coming from a farming community we found the fact that all of the male bovine in the film having udders drawn on them was a little disturbing we felt like we were watching cross dressing cows or something it was just odd to hear a male voice come from a female body after checking some of the production notes on a different website i felt like the animators might have slipped up on this fact i know this is just an animated humorous show but by putting female body parts on a male i had to suspend my disbelief so much that i just couldn t enjoy the movie like i might have i know udders can be found funny but they were definitely over used none of the other animals in the movie seemed to have gender specific body parts drawn on them and i would have preferred the bulls in this show to at least have the correct ones if they had to be drawn on at all the kids however still enjoyed the movie though we took the time afterward to make sure they knew the difference between bulls and cows,0
17221,many other viewers are saying that this is not a good movie to watch since they feel that it isn t realistic how can it not be considered realistic they feel that say the incest part isn t easy to relate to that it isn t common i can guarantee you that you have met more people than you think that have had an incest act occur many of them aren t going to come out and say it and mostly these are victims also many people are gay and are still in the closest because no matter how much they would like it to be they know they will be ridiculed and possibly even abandoned and tell me how many kids have you went to high school with that has ended up being pregnant or had an eating disorder i bet a lot and although pregnancy isn t from incest most of the time its still easy to relate to who can t relate to being an outcast or being bullied that happens all the time and many viewers are probably concerned with there education such as marcus being a stoner seems to be quite common these days to so there are a lot of things to relate to more than the rest though no matter how popular you may get sometimes you feel invisible or alone not noticed or overlooked such as the suicide victim how can you not feel like you can relate to the movie i find that the movie may have seemed pointless to others but i would like to think of it as important it an interesting way of showing that suicide happens and to be aware it comes from the people that don t show their unhappy thoughts its very surprising the people who show there problems do commit suicide sometimes to but when you hear of suicide who would have guessed is usually running through most peoples minds the ending surprised me i wasn t expecting it to be the girl that until the end was mostly an extra in the scenes not even introduced the story even in its description says its about 6 teenage lives when in fact it was 7 my only real disappointment was that it wasn t one of the characters that we got to learn about it merely at first seems like the movie was pointless to watch if the real victim is just some random chick until i thought more it made perfect sense for being a huge surprise since thats what suicides are like plus who was to choose who any of the other students had more of a reason than the other though this movie has some bad points most movies have a few but i would recommend this movie as long as you can deal with watching the tragic moments of watching the suicide and violence and profanity shown in this film,1
13141,i really only watched this movie because it had rupert grint in it who i knew as ron from the harry potter movies i had never really appreciated rupert as an actor until this movie i loved the entire film rupert does a wonderful job in this hilarious quirky movie i think the movie could have been fine without the sex but it worked somehow i can t wait to see more of rupert s films in the future julie walters also did an amazing job in the harry potter movies she has a very small role so i didn t quite know what to expect from her either but she was wonderful as dame evie the part where she swallows the key was absolutely hilarious overall an amazing movie,1
16571,that s right ohwon the painter and the main character is an exceptional person what strikes me most is the message this film might address to all of you people there and the message is sad it says that it s very difficult to do anything that s amazing or maybe even genius without having to obey the governments establishment and other vips of this world and even if you try you might not be able to bear it it is about the battle of a single person with a system with many systems a great film of this wonderful korean director please see it if you do have an opportunity,1
16709,ross hunter s musical remake of the 1937 fantasy based on james hilton s enduring bestseller was written off by critics and audiences almost immediately in 1973 sounding off a backlash against musicals in general that gave the genre a bad reputation in hollywood for years group of disparate british and american individuals end up on an emergency flight out of a war torn asian country but their plane is hijacked and crashes in a snowy mountain terrain a rescue party arrives and leads the group to an isolated community called shangri la where the sun is always shining and most of the residents are youthful and blissfully content some of the performances by the classy cast aren t so classy the effervescent mood of the piece the lilting burt bacharach hal david tunes as well as the lightweight direction all conspire to make the performers look just a bit silly peter finch is the international peace keeper who becomes involved in a somewhat constipated romance with resident liv ullmann sally kellerman is a malcontent who spits out lines like i got tired of taking pictures of people with their heads blown off so that people with their heads still on and usually under hairdryers could get one last kick before turning to the latest recipe john gieguld as chang an asian who learned to speak english while attending oxford is humorously self amused but why no songs for chang hal david s dopey lyrics are sometimes jaw dropping on the good ship lollipop how did christopher columbus sail across the sea and the pacing gets bogged down with all that chatter about the outside world and how nothing is more pitiful today however the production is lush and the general handling strangely affecting the two dimensional characters are so overly serious they actually become endearing and the movie s silliness is infectious it ends up being a lot of fun from,1
4225,decent action scenes but the movie is saddled with a slow convoluted storyline nearly non existent dialogue that leads to minimal character development and a seriously horrible storyline did i mention that the storyline made no sense but in its defense the action scenes were impressive enough even if they leave you scratching your head as to why they just happened there s not much else to say about the movie it s a slick mindless action adventure that makes no sense whatsoever it s like watching a worse version of the matrix and skipping all the storyline and dialogue,0
21767,this is exactly what australian television and australian politics needs people with a sense of humour good on abc for supporting these guys the show is based around a couple of aussie blokes who know how to take the mickey out of politicians or other people in the limelight the boys use sydney as their main base for making a splash in the public keep an eye out for the crazy wharehouse guy or mr ten questions the guys who perform these acts are the same guys that presented cnnn if you enjoyed cnnnn and the glasshouse then you will love this show i am still interested in knowing which stunts are real and which are purely acting because there are some questionable actions made by the guys,1
3124,i didn t watch this show that much when i was little and i think i only watched 1 episode which was about railroads i believe because i liked trains and still do even then i thought it was a baby show i mostly watched arthur the songs are pretty weird too and i don t think it s that educational either they just sing some dumb nursery rhymes this is a dumb show any adults who like it are crazy if you want some good kids shows watch something like arthur mister rogers neighborhood or even better pee wee s playhouse i thought sesame street was boring when i was little but even that is better than barney trust me this show is pretty dumb there are other kids shows that are better than this one i can see many of the reviews here that a lot of people don t like this show now there are some mature people i hope they take this show off air soon,0
17419,one of my favorite movies of all times have seen it three times already it does a great job of summing up the isrelai walks of life israeli humor and seriousness and much of the problems israelis go through universal theme of wanting to be accepted and be accepted for who you are good subtle humor and it s the charisma of the characters that makes this movie magic and says a lot about isrlaei culture and the irnonicness contradictions and humor with a great actor in it oshri cohen i highly recommend it to anyone and it s a movie perfect for practically anyone family movie boyfriend girlfriend movie and also says apart from israeli culture wanting to be accepted most of all how important family is with all its diversity and imperfections great great movie,1
12221,back in 2002 when matthew lawrence did the hot chick i also saw drumline that day drumline wins by default if the comebcaks had been released in march as planned the same time tmnt was released tmnt would ve won by default granted matthew lawrence did a fine job portraying a quarterback he didn t have to resort to uttering dirty words which is a plus but when he started playing with his private parts as well as another football players and touching a girl s boob those were the minuses but the biggest minus that ticked me off is that every football player got to participate in the mock music video except matthew lawrence insert the price is right s losing horns another blown musical opportunity for him just because he s shy about doing music in the past matt has disappointed me many times super human samurai syber squad where he came so close to having a musical moment but ended up failing sure joey had a singing career with two albums to his belt and andrew s starting a music career of his own but it s very rare to find a matt musical moment the two that stand out would be on brotherly love where he played the guitar and sang pigeon on your car art atrack which he wrote by the way and that romantic boy meets world moment when he sang this dame as time goes by matt you ve played jocks too long why not make a musical comeback you have a good voice and i miss your musical side,0
4968,i purchased this one for a couple of dollars at the local video store as they cleared out their tapes in favour of dvds i doubt they ll be replacing this one somehow i couldn t say that it s one of the worst movies i ve ever seen but it s very dull no real cannibal scenes me me lai is not naked enough of the time only about 4 or 5 times and she s not the thai goddess that i expected either so two of my reasons for watching this movie were knocked out there is some severe animal violence here for those that enjoy that sort of thing a great fight between a mongoose and a large snake gets quite bloody animal torture as well some of which is real and some fake thankfully the fake is somewhat funny but the real is just a little sickening generally speaking it s a 70s film overly long under developed not as deep as it would have liked to have been but it s something different right one and a half stars,0
2871,this flick is worse than awful it took a good story plot and turned it into schizophrenic cinema the photography is extremely amateurish looks like a 5th graders home movie project filmed with malfunctioning 8mm kiddie cameras the editing appears to have been done by somebody having psychotic flashbacks while on drugs and booze with scenes cut short followed by other unrelated scenes then chopped segments of scenes pasted in totally unnecessary and gratuitous nudity missing scenes daytime scenes inexplicably turning into night time scenes then suddenly back to daytime obviously no continuity tom skerritt wendy hughes and james mason s good acting skills are wasted as are the talents of the key supporting cast forget the villain and the anderson women very amateurish acting this movie is a good candidate for a remake even with skerritt and hughes just have it professionally done this time,0
13315,gene roddenberry never let his fans down his death ended sci fi legacy that will never be matched earth the final conflict was proof his pilot film and the first 2 seasons were well written and meticulously produced but somewhere along the way the roddenberry touch was lost the loss of lead kevin kilner william boone definitely hurt the series as he was a vital part of what made it work the story involves the human race being visited by the taelons an extra terrestrial race who dub themselves the companions after 3 years they have given earth new technologies helpful information about the universe and more many question their intentions here on earth the main liaison on earth between the races is da an leni parker and he is to many the most trustworthy taelon questions arise just why are they here what are their goals is da an aware of any suspected plots against the humans there is an underground group led by millionaire industrialist jonathan doors david hemblen who utilizes his millions to investigate the taelons by the end of the first season things are going well da an seems trustworthy boone assists doors in his investigation while working with da an and the taelons as a liaison in the middle of the 2nd season things start unraveling and the once terrific and fascinating series spirals downward mostly because roddenberry had died and was not around to guide the producers of whom his wife majel barrett roddenberry was co producer still the first season remains intriguing and fun to watch,1
18424,shepitko is the wife of russian filmmaker elem klimov who directed the more commercially known 1984 film come and see generally regarded as one of the most realistic war films ever bar none notable for its searing poetic intensity but i believe it lacks the inner complexity of this even greater russian film which examines not just the graphic outer horrors but she finds truly inspiring images focusing on individuals or small groups of characters that reflect the absolute insanity taking place inside these human beings the ending of which is simply awe inspiring bullets are flying and bodies are dying in a gun skirmish over the opening credits where the intensity of the film never lets up throughout the duration focusing on grim faces worn out soldiers with next to nothing to eat a terrified population under occupation starving children with petrified mothers all cast in an immense landscape of endless white snow like cranes are flying 1957 this features a russian army in retreat a traumatizing shock early in the war when they were nearly wiped out the russian countryside has been overrun by german nazi s who are terrorizing the citizens stealing what food they have forcing them under duress to become their informant eyes and ears what russian soldiers are left hide under cover of forests but are forced to send food expeditions to neighboring farms this film follows two soldiers that from the outset are on a near impossible mission as there s little food left anywhere in the dead of winter one is healthy and fit vladimir gostyukhin as rybak while the other boris plotnikov as sotnikov is slowed down by a tubercular sounding cough and eventually a bullet in his leg that nearly leaves him for dead but his partner heroically rescues him as they step through knee deep snow drifts crawling at some points with insufficient protection against the harsh elements like so many other russian films nature itself becomes their toughest foe spoilers everything is reduced to a matter of survival when they reach their destination the farm has been demolished and left in a state of rubble pushing forward into german occupied territory where the next farm is manned by an elderly soviet collaborator who fears nazi retribution the partisan soldiers think him a coward but move on where they are eventually captured and brought to a nazi camp in a nearby town and held as prisoners along with a proud and protective mother lyudmila polyakova who helped hide them tarkovsky stalwart anatoli solonitsyn appears as portnov the interrogator a russian teacher from a nearby academy turned nazi sympathizer russians torturing and executing fellow russians is the depth of war depravity and solonitsyn is brilliant in the despicable role he s perfectly suited for from what we can see as nazi officers chat jovially in close proximity to one another he is an outsider even among this group seen instead as a kind of gruesome black cloaked undertaker who routinely sends men to their graves the audience is not spared from witnessing acts of torture on sotnikov who offers nothing but contempt while rybak speaks freely hoping to save his life but both are condemned to die though rybak is offered a chance to serve the german reich as a police agent the mother the elderly collaborator and a child are added to this group spending one last night together alive where together they discuss the merits of a soldier s mission of being a patriot a mother a coward or a collaborator each seems individually driven by a desperate need to survive but sotnikov offers himself as a selfless example attempting to confess his guilt to spare the others where the aptly chosen title reflects his spiritual redemption by the next morning portnov seems mildly amused mocking them at their sudden willingness to talk but spares no one except rybak who changes sides to keep his life rationalizing in his thoughts that if he s alive at least he has a chance to escape but there is no escape not from this torment what happens is shown with exquisite delicacy and poetic grace as we witness the treachery of war without a single shot being fired as the execution by hanging is turned into a public spectacle where the villagers at the point of a gun are forced to witness the pace and harrowing intensity of this film is relentless as there is never a moment without impending menace gorgeously shot by vladimir chukhnov who died in the same car accident as shepitko featuring perfectly composed landscapes and plenty of camera movement much of it at close range using portraitures especially that of a fierce young boy at the end who eyes the condemned men who makes a surreal connection to the next generation without any words being spoken accentuated by the psychologically horrific music of alfred shnittke which resembles the transcendent yet furiously disturbing monolith music from kubrick s 2001 a space odyssey 1968 the sound design of this film is highly advanced and uniquely modern where the use of off screen sound continually exposes the raw nerves of each moment dogs barking wind blowing bullets firing nearby nazi s chattering in untranslated german or laughing sadistically at their helplessness which only ratchets up the hideous tension to insane heights in many ways resembling dreyer s the passion of joan of arc 1928 utter insanity is exposed here the relentless realization that you have no choice yet you are forced to make one anyway the nightmarish inner thoughts at the end are expressed wordlessly where the nobility of the dead speaks volumes where voices continue to reverberate inside the heads of the living like an explosion of neverending echoes yet only silence fills the crisp wintry air with a mournful reverence and a profound sense of loss,1
663,northanger abbey is not my favorite jane austen novel but it has its charms this movie doesn t it has some of the same character names as the book but the story is drastically altered and the sweetest man in the whole austen canon unless emma s mr knightley gets pride of place is made out to be a heartless and mercenary creep one or two totally extraneous characters are introduced and a palpable air of corseted perversion hangs over it all i was so disappointed when i first saw it on its release in 1986 even today it ranks high on the list of films that disgrace the books on which they re based even robert hardy fans should give this one a wide berth it has nothing and i mean n o t h i n g to recommend it,0
10813,its perhaps unfair of me to comment on this film because for the first time ever i switched off a movie because it was so bad i can watch anything but this movie was so very boring i was bored before i put on the dvd and thought this might be a laughable action horror action movie to lighten the mood it is not even that it is a device which increases the level of boredom by the power of 100 had to switch it off after 45 minutes because all that had happened in that time was some people had been scuba diving and a big mole had been discovered seriously this movie is not worth the time even if you can enjoy a bad movie like i can avoid this film like the plague worst thing i have seen in years,0
17166,i went to see the italian job with mixed reviews in my head i was pleasantly surprised with an entertaining close to 2 hours i thought the cast was just great and so were the special effects with the safe and truck just dropping out of sight if you like fast paced action movies this is the one to see,1
22339,arguably the finest serial ever made no argument here thus far about earthman flash gordon professor zarkov and beautiful dale arden traveling in a rocket ship to another universe to save the planet along the way in spellbinding spectacular and action packed chapters flash and his friends along with new found friends such as prince barin prince thun and the awesome king vultan pool their resources together to fight the evils and armies of the merciless ming of mongo and the jealous treachery of his daughter priness aura now she s a car this serial is not just a cut above most serials in terms of plot acting and budget it is miles ahead in these areas produced by universal studios it has many former sets at its disposable like the laboratory set from the bride of frankenstein and the opera house from the phantom of the opera just to name a few the production values across the board are advanced in my most humble opinion for 1936 the costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are really creative and first rate we get hawk men shark men lion men high priests creatures like dragons octasacks orangapoids and tigrons oh my and many many other fantastic things are all of them believable and first rate special effects no way but for 1936 most are very impressive the musical score is awesome and the chapter beginnings are well written lengthy enough to revitalize viewer memories of the former chapter and expertly scored director frederick stephani does a great job piecing everything together wonderfully and creating a worthy film for alex raymond s phenom comic strip lastly the acting is pretty good in this serial all too often serials have either no names with no talent surrounding one or two former talents here most everyone has some ability don t get me wrong this isn t a shakespeare troupe by any means but buster crabbe does a workmanlike likable job as flash he is ably aided by jean arden priscella lawson and the rest of the cast in general with two performers standing out but before i get to those two let me add as another reviewer noted it must have been amazing for this serial to get by the hayes office i see more flesh on flash and on jean rogers and priscella lawson than in movies decades later the shorts crabbe and unfortunately for all of us professor zarkov frank shannon wears are about as form fitting a pair of shorts guys can wear the girls are wearing mid drifts throughout and are absolutely beautiful jean rogers may have limited acting talent but she is a blonde bombshell lawson is also very sultry and sensuous and beautiful but for me the two actors that make the serial are charles middleton as ming officious sardonic merciless and fun middleton is a class act jack tiny lipson plays king vultan boisterous rousing hilarious a symbol for pure joy in life and the every essence of hedonism lipson steals each and every scene he is in the plot meanders here there and everywhere but flash gordon is the penultimate serial space opera and the basis for loads of science fiction to follow excellent,1
20141,this one reeler produced by mgm in 1936 showcases the talents of two of its young stars under contract judy garland and deanna durbin in a way these short films were promotional trailers that featured new talent in front or behind the camera felix feist directed this one which was a way to promote the two talented stars to the public the story is simple enough the orchestra that entertains in a public park every sunday doesn t get the attention it deserves enter two music aficionados judy and edna who love to hear the band play conducted by one of their grandfathers two of the town s elders sensing there is no public for this type of entertainment have decided to cancel their sunday concerts in favor of a more popular orchestra that will attract a wider audience the two girls embark in a promotional tour of their own doing what they only know calling and running errands and being helpful to their neighbors in exchange for a promise they will attend the park concert next sunday well that day comes and to their surprise hardly anyone comes as the music starts the two girls decide to take matters into their own and ask the conductor to play a song for them to sing the result is clear people all over the park flocks to hear the talented young singers thus ensuring the orchestra s existence of course the only attraction of the short film is the inspired singing by the two stars who are wonderful in their rendition ms durbin s operatic voice blends well with ms garland s natural one creating a lovely duet don t miss it whenever it shows on tcm,1
2797,the first time i watched this movie i was ten years old i thought it was bad then and at that age i had no cinematic taste whatsoever i watched this movie on cinemax about 3 days ago and was reminded why i hated the movie in the first place madonna s character nikki is annoying and obnoxious there s no way that the main character would ever fall in love with her the jokes were corny and the dialogue was worse than a t v soap opera i m glad that i didn t see this movie at the theatre or rent it i feel bad for my parents who had to endure watching it with me madonna is not necessarily a bad actress but in this role she is portrayed as a complete idiot,0
16036,sacha baron cohen is a genius and this movie is good although the film doesn t nearly reach the quality of the tv show it s still very funny and has some seriously wicked moments i ve liked ali g since the first time i saw the material from the show i think he s one of the best comedy characters of all time up there with say peter dragon action and the blues brothers biggest surprise with this film was that they ve actually got some serious actors to do it dance and gambon after this i will absolutely respect them even more for having the good sense to take this chance i have nothing really bad to say about this film it s very funny very juvenile but hey so what one more thing to mr g sequel please,1
3476,conclusion very but very very boring yet i watched till the end hoping for some upside down effect but the end was worse because it was nothing the old black white game didn t helped at all it usually helps psychological movies but this was not the case the script the plot etc were linear had no substance nothing in going when you deal with psychological you deal with analysis therefore with details that unity diversity formula there was no essence no detail just a story there are many stories to tell but something makes them unique and hard to forgive with the tools and creativity of movie makers well this is not the one,0
19642,i can hardly call this a great film but it is entertaining in my case i at the time this film was released was the same age as some of the junior campers in the film for me watching this film brings back the memories of my camp years while some of the pranks that takes place in this movie like carrying the camp director out in his bed and leaving him on the side of a road strung up in the trees or out on a lake are a bit over the top some of the other pranks are not when i went to camp the campers and counselors pulled similar stunts such as running underwear up the flag pole canoe battles and boys raiding the girls cabin as i grew older i realized these night raids to the girls cabin that i participated in were carefully orchestrated by the counselors so that we wouldn t find the girls in embarrassing situations but at the time i thought it was real and it was fun that s what meatballs mb is mb captures not only the scenic beauty of camp surroundings but the beauty of being young and carefree mb give a great example of pre teens teens and young adults living their summer with no concerns other than guys hooking up with girls and girls hooking up with guys and booth having as much fun as they can before they head back to junior high high school and college the opening title song that goes are you ready for the summer no more homework no more books no more teachers dirty looks describes exactly how summer is viewed by school kids i personally enjoyed the two campers spaz and fink what boy nerd or jock didn t spend all camp trying to cozy up to some pretty girl camper what guy didn t want to be accepted by the other campers and counselors while these two characters are somewhat over the top i bet everybody who watches the film can t help but to like these two guys these two characters are a mix of charlie brown from peanuts and jack tripper larry dallas from three s company i would bet that most viewers even cheer for spaz in the egg carrying competition and for fink as he attempts to beat the stomach in the hot dog eating contest lastly this movie had normal looking kids and counselors no super models for counselors or campers that wore trendy clothing it is fun to just kick back and watch this film and remember when life was as fun as this movie,1
3327,i m a big fan of the first critters movie the second episode is good but it s not as good as the first critters the third episode is a little bit boring but lovely and what is this what a crap it s stupid and really really boring it s the worst of the series i can t watch it again because i felt asleep at the first watch and ug s evil side eeewww that s one of the most horribble moments of the movie in the first 50 minutes we can t see the little furry monsters that s the reason why the audience fell asleep at the beginning of the movie it could have been much better 2 10,0
760,my wife and i saw this in the theater when it first came out there were only 3 couples there and we all walked out about the same time this is the only movie i have ever walked out on it was just painful to sit through the theater actually stopped us on the way out and asked if we wanted a refund never had that happen before or since pleae do not rent this you will really regret it i am really sureprised by the vote summary perhaps personal tast has something to do with it,0
22424,the devil in the dark is william shatner s favorite episode it is also one of my favorite episodes the program is pure star trek because it deals with one of the series main themes the respect for other life forms i do not think one could get a clearer example of one of the show s most interesting ideas in this episode kirk and his crew have to confront a monster that is killing miners on a distant planet the story is an excuse to explore the right that humans have to destroy creatures that are a vital part of the environment today s concerns with environmental causes make the show more relevant now than ever before it is extremely well written and performed with gusto by our beloved cast one memorable sequence involves spock joining with the mind of the monster plenty of tension between spock and kirk they want to solve the problem using different methods adds to the fun shatner and leonard nimoy do some of their best work here,1
11428,i don t know why all the previous comments are approval of this movie it is well not by far but the suckiest movie i ve seen lately full of clich s bad acting actually no very bad acting and has a silly plot if i would have seen it in a cinema i would have walked out after the first 20 minutes i f you hate somebody make him her watch this movie that s how bad it is a girl who has an imaginary boy friend that gives up a relationship with a real one because her imagination is jealous but i think it figures she takes after her parents who also have some mental issues plus the character who is supposed to be i think the laughing stock of it the thing that should make you laugh cal s room mate is a serious nut case and just makes me feel sorry for him and the whole movie,0
2368,no way out 2007 was a really bad and if it is the road to wrestlemania they choose the wrong road chris benoit the hardy boys def mvp minn in my view this was the best match of the night some good wrestling here but not much 7 10cruisweight championship open which chavo guerrero won awful no high flying at all really quick and boring 3 10little bastard finlay def little bogeyman the bogeyman this was more comedy than wrestling some laughs 5 10kane def king booker a decent effort by these two but they could do better 6 10wwe tag team championship paul london brian kendrick def deuce domino another boring match no high flying by the champs 4 10ecw world title mr kennedy def bobby lashley disquilification in my mind the worst match of the night truly awful i thought ecw was no rules i was wrong 2 10john cena shawn michaels def batista the undertaker an okay match but could have been a hell of a lot better 6 10overall this was bulls it id give it a 3 10,0
10729,in the xxii century an architect by the name of merchant bruce ramsay commandeers a space station which he personally designed as can be predicted a special force is sent to retake the expensive station and put merchant into custody upon arrival they find him partaking in a weird ritual with the use of a mysterious cubical during interrogation he reveals that they must let him finish what he has started or else the hell he has released will bathe in blood in order to convince the officers holding him captive he reminisces about his heritage about the toymaker who built the box and about the reasons as to why he is here in space the movie that is essentially the same to hellraiser that the quickening was to highlander something to be ignored and forgotten as so it won t influence the lore of hellraiser to much by far the most trashy of the franchise with a much more low grade feel to it than its predecessors who let s face it were b or c class films acting at times seems to be influenced by a mid budget porn flick with wooden unbelievable performances that actually have you thinking so when are they going to undress and start with the intercourse surprisingly not much sex in the movie albeit the introduction of the seductress demon angelique a totally superfluous character that unnecessarily messes with what we know of the world of hellraiser offers ample opportunities for the love making basically the movie consists of three abruptly pasted together separate short stories one in the future one in the present and one in the past which lack focus and are rushed along in amateurish fashion the end result is extremely poor basically underlined by the fact you have no interest into what happens to any of the characters in the film some decent gore in the flick but apart from that an utter failure,0
16801,this show really is the broadway american idol it has singing the british guy a guy who s sometimes nice and a super nice woman of course it is different because there is a sing off and there s dancing and some acting we just don t see some of the acting i gave this show a 7 because there are a couple tweaks that i know a lot of people including me would make if they were working for the show the first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges deciding who goes home i know they want to find the right danny and sandy but america should have the power to decide who does home there s really no point to the sing off the person with the lowest number of votes usually goes home anyway another things i d change is to see them actually act on the show what s broadway without the acting the last thing that need to be changed is the song the eliminated people sing at the end the eliminated danny always sings the same song and the eliminated sandy always sings the same song as they exit since they sing it every week those songs eventually get annoying i admit to not being a fan of the movie grease but for some reason i am hooked this show is very underrated it has so many memorable performances and moments,1
7543,mainly a biography of a lustful doctor robert merivel robert downey who has his way in the king s palace for the first half of the film and then helps out the downtrodden in the second half mainly katharine meg ryan the good fantastic set decoration i e the lush king s palace and costuming make this a visual treat the language is also very tame ian mckellen and hugh grant provide interesting support the bad after 50 60 minutes this movie simply gets too boring it desperately needed to be given some spark after an hour but it does the opposite it drags on and on the script certainly needed some badly needed restoration shall we say the film may look nice but it s a long two hours to sit through too long,0
17556,labyrinth of passion with the possible exception of matador is almodovar s best film it displays his unique personality at its best and least censored before he started going more mainstream almodovar is just about the only modern director that can approach preston sturges wonderful brand of lunacy it s pointless to try and explain what the movie is about the real point being almodovar s willingness and skill in taking his situations to the outer limits of sanity and sometimes of plausibility and taste as well,1
18477,the word impossible has led many to select a particular view concerning any incredible task in 1927 it was believed no man could fly the breath of the atlantic ocean many had tried but failed and some even gave their lives to the effort nevertheless it had to be done as every challenge needs to be met with equal determination such then is the heart of this movie called the spirit of st louis the actor chosen for this historic film is none other than america s own james stewart who convincingly plays charles lindbergh although there are many facets of lindbergh s life the segment featured here is his efforts to be the first man to fly across the atlantic the story is an interesting one and for stewards fans compelling to say the least seeking enough funds to build a special aircraft to the fateful decision to began the journey on a gloomy day in may 1927 luck lindy as he was christened endured enormous risks which are featured in this superb film other notables which helped make this film believable are murray hamilton who plays bud gurney bartlett robinson as ben mahoney arthur space and charles watts as o w schultz the sum total of this now famous movie is that despite poor endorsement on its debut it has since become a classic in it s own right well done,1
15038,this is a little seen anti war film that has been ignored for too long the time is thanksgiving of 1972 the place is a typical suburban home somewhere in texas the oldest son has just comeback from vietnam and he is having a hell of time readjusting to the life he had left behind and the family does not know how to handle the problem i honestly don t think i m exaggerating when i say this is one the most heart wrenching war films i ve seen the funny thing is that there are only a handful of combat sequences in the entire movie most of the story takes place inside a house over a period of a couple of days but the kind of war that takes place in this home is as intense as any real battlefield action the film does something that is difficult to accomplish somehow estevez and his team have created a film that embodies the entire vietnam experience and considering the similarities between vietnam and the current invasion of iraq the film is surprisingly relevant estevez does a magnificent job with material he gets a lot of help from a hand picked cast martin sheen and kathy bates in particular are superb as the parents a truly moving film highly recommended,1
10554,after the opening credits over a black sheet of paper with spots of white paint sprayed onto it oh ok i ll be generous and call it a star field we witness an alien spacecraft crashing into a meteorite and being forced to land on earth a terrible looking model spacecraft lands on a terrible looking model field three nearby campers investigate from the burning spacecraft a reptile like looking alien the nightbeast emerges ok so i lied it s a guy in a dodgy rubber monster mask and silver spacesuit the campers are quickly killed by the nighbeast s laser gun which shoots awful special effects at people the towns sheriff jack cinder tom griffith is informed he alerts his deputy lisa kent karin kardian and gathers a posse of men together to investigate meanwhile the nightbeast has killed an unlucky motorist who stopped on the side of the road for a leak his two annoying kids run for help they approach a house inside two young people are kissing the girl says someones running towards the house the guy gets up to take a look and is attacked and gutted by the nightbeast it kills the girl as well then it manages to kill the two kids with his laser maybe the nightbeast ain t so bad after all once the sheriff and his men arrive at the scene they have a gun laser battle with the nightbeast after possibly the most unexciting gun fight in film history only the sheriff his deputy and a local man jamie lambert jamie zemarel survive but the nightbeast is still alive bullets seem to have no effect on it the next day the sheriff visits the towns mayor bert wicker richard dyszel and his girlfriend mary jane eleanor herman to get permission to evacuate everyone in the town he refuses saying a party he is holding for the governor richard ruxton cannot be cancelled and that he doesn t want to create a panic situation the sheriff evacuates the town anyway two doctors steven price george stover and ruth sherman anne firth are attacked by the nightbeast before they can leave however they manage to scare the nightbeast away and survive together with the sheriff his deputy and jamie they decide to stay behind and fight the alien written and directed by don dohler this has to be an amateur film made with family and friends look at the credits and see how many dohler s are involved for that reason i should probably cut it some slack but that still doesn t stop it or excuse it from being a throughly awful film in every department it has no story or purpose things just happen to waste time whats with drago don leifert strangling his ex girlfriend suzie monica neff this and many more scenes add nothing to the film the script has no logic either why does the nightbeast stick around the town once it s been supposedly evacuated the special effects are embarrassingly bad just look at the effect when the nightbeast shoots someone with his laser a computer effect an 80 s spectrum would be ashamed of there s not really much blood or gore in it a ripped open stomach a severed arm and a decapitation but they all look predictably poor credit where it s due the nightbeast itself looks alright for the most part there s a sex scene between the sheriff and his deputy which has to be seen to be believed music that even a porno would be embarrassed about and two really ugly naked people make this a difficult sequence to watch less than stellar acting photography music lighting and editing make it a real chore to sit through and the worse thing about this film it commits the mortal sin of being boring and not fun in the slightest sorry don mate but don t give up the day job definitely one to avoid,0
19792,this movie just screened on channel seven australian tv today in my opinion it was a very interesting take on how the nazi s treated the russian jews as mercilessly as everywhere else kellie martin did a really great job and her tears and frustration as frusia were quite convincing the holocaust is a part of our history that we must not forget schindlers list wasn t the first and it wont be the last account of survival and courage in that five year nightmare my family is dutch and i will always applaud any movie makers who want to keep the candlelight alive by telling of someone s courage to stand up and help those who were being abused violated and murdered for being a jew,1
11548,i can t believe this terrible film was made by the same people who made lepa sela lepo gore watch that and skip this the plot is muddled and the characters are mostly two dimensional stereotypes i suspect the editor went on vacation halfway through the film because quick choppy cuts start to appear that only confuse matters rather than elucidate them the ending doesn t make sense either this is predominantly a propaganda film made so serbs can feel sorry for themselves and vilify america for the nato bombings of 1999 they do this by perpetuating lies about serbs being our allies during wwii claiming the whole world is unjustly against them and completely ignoring everything said and done by slobodan milosevic like waging war on three neighboring countries they seem intent on making a political film but only show a few seconds of milosevic on a tv screen with no sound a nationalist agenda obviously superseded any consideration of art which was not the case with lepa sela regrettably i recommended this film to a teacher when it played last week at the seattle international film festival he also cited the bad editing and confusing plot and i had to apologize for the bad advice you ve been warned,0
14510,after reading some of these reviews it is apparent that some have missed the point what is great about this film here comes the point what is incredible about this film what is astonishing about this film is that there is no proselytizing there is no preaching there is no preaching there is no preaching life goes on it is a masterpiece in letting an audience think for its collective self these are just kids doing what kids do without consciousness we all went to school with kids like these we are being numbed by fiction movie tv news based reality invention feck s dennis hopper the great girlfriend alone and his relationship with her is worth the price of renting this movie there have been few movies before or since that measure up to the intelligence of this film amen,1
4491,rented this from my local blockbuster under the title speck that may be the way to look for it if you still feel the need to see it after this review it s a movie about the serial killer richard speck who killed several nurses in chicago in the sixties watching the movie one gets the feeling that it follows the crimes to the letter unfortunately that doesn t make for a good movie another problem i had was the near constant music letting us know that this was a scary movie and some god awful narration letting us know what s motivating speck the acting was average for this type of film to give credit where credit is due the movie is very beautifully photographed for my taste your mileage may vary over all if you re interested in the subject matter it may be worth your time,0
5895,being a huge laura gemser fan i picked this up at a rental outlet just to see another emanuelle film boy did i make a mistake emanuelle in egypt has nothing to do with emanuelle laura gemser is in it along with her husband gabriele tinti but that is the only connection to emanuelle here laura plays laura original huh a beautiful supermodel who goes to visit her wealthy friend pia annie belle in egypt in tow are her a hole photographer carlo a haggard looking gabriele tinti and some blonde woman who is never named also living in pia s mansion is horatio the sexy but dumb al cliver a mystique who speaks nothing but nonsense arriving for the weekend are pia s two daughters one a short haired lesbian and the other a brunette lots of sex is implied but hardly shown one good looking actor plays ali the egyptian servant who gets lucky with three of the women in the mansion laura has sex with the lesbian the lesbian has sex with horatio pia and the blonde have sex with horatio at an egyptian orgy laura drinks goats blood and is possessed during an egyptian ceremony carlo rapes laura it all happens with so little flair that emanuelle in egypt is one of the worst movies i ve ever seen far from erotic even the actors themselves look bored during their sex scenes considering there were two famous couples in this film laura and gabriele al and annie the number of available sex scenes are uncountable instead a film that offers a top notch eurocult cast and never delivers the goods will piss every viewer off except the hardcore laura gemser completist otherwise steer clear of emanuelle in egypt,0
12486,something strange is happening in loch ness the water is crystal clear nor cold a giant robotic plastic monster emerges and kills scots what is this movie first i love reading stories about nessie sea monsters in general when i saw this for sale i thought it was a cheap rip off of jaws no it was terrible the story was pointless acting was 100 garbage the only up side was the cool mechanical nessie they used it was full of inaccuracy wrong locations and bad everything not worth your while just leave it on the shelf or garbage can you found it on on second note this film was shot in cailifornia not loch ness a major diss to nessie fans,0
9945,the texas revolution of 1835 to 1836 including the periods preceding and immediately following is depicted in this mediocre 3 hour made for television film whose only redeeming value is bringing light and paying homage to stephen f austin the so called father of texas whose life story had long been overshadowed by that of the legendary sam houston the rest of the film is simply the usual santa anna is a tyrant storyline and with a weak attempt to show the mexican perspective with a fictional hispanic character displaying stereotypical latin machismo combined with short low budget battle scenes such as the alamao and san jacinto this film is recommended only for real history buffs who who do not come from mexico to its credit the mexican uniforms look accurate and the romantic subplot another love triangle doesn t take up too much screen time overall this movie depicts the violent secession movement by texas anglo saxon racial minority to be a positive and just revolution against mexican tyranny as personified by the general antonio lopez de santa anna the so called napoleon of the west,0
11776,some famous stories are prone to being moved to another epoch and as such becoming an embarrassing tv movie oscar wilde s canterville ghost is one of them this tv movie for kids is utterly cheap concerning acting character work credibility directing and even concerning the modest special effects as often the question arises what was this made for,0
17589,i have done a lot of international travel both on business and as a tourist for both types i assure you the best advice is also the oldest always drink the wine of the country in this movie the archangel michael comes to earth on business wraps it up quickly and decides to hang around for a little touring boy does he drink the wine of the country could man be drunk forever with liquor love and fights he d lief rise up of mornings and lief lie down of nights these are things you can t do in heaven so he enjoys them while he s here of course it turns out he had a couple of other jobs to tackle and if he is less direct about them than he was about the first one he is just as successful the final scene is a little schmaltzy but it is also wonderful jean stapleton gets to dance with john travolta,1
17799,every role down to the smallest has been cast and acted with bravado the extraordinary jena malone never takes a misstep her two co stars are equal to her in this film ryan gosling may be the best actor of his generation chris klein gives his best performance to date this is a thought and conversation provoking film that should be seen by teens and young adults you ll think and talk about this film for days highly recommended,1
4178,post 1988 after the disaster gjs amitabh s films lost the quality they had earlier barring main azaad hoon released in 1989 which was a great film rest all films were craps mostly except hum 1991 later in 1991this is another of the crap amitabh films people rejected in early 90 sthe film he did like a friendship token to shashi kapoor who directed the film and he didn t take a penny the film also had rishi and dimple again not paired opp each other after ranbhoomi the film came in 1991 when bachchan had 4 releases and 3 flops amongst them indrajeet akayla ajooba ajooba came 2 years after toofan and jaadugar both supernatural films which were rejected this is another type of crap bachchan wears a mask and a krissh type outfit and performs magic changing 1 person to a donkey etc of course being 1991 you can excuse the special effects but the film is too bad to be watcheddirection by shashi kapoor is not good music is badamongst actors amitabh had become too old by 1991 and looked tired his acting is okay but not on par with his best rishi is okay dimple is alright rest are forgettable,0
4208,this movie reminds me old b movies but not in a good way when i saw the first scene i thought it was going to be a spoof of one of those early sf films the terrible acting the plastic props and the noticeable visual effects gave me that impression but no the movie is really that bad the story is a complete nonsense the effects are below the level of a tv production even the editing is a mess the only thing that kept me in the theater was that i wanted to know the end of the story although i was pretty sure it was going to be silly and it was there are better ways to spend your time and money,0
2385,first of all let me make it clear this movie is a real piece of garbage but although it is a real piece of garbage it is an better piece of garbage than it could have been it could have sucked big time but it doesn t what this movie didn t have was for example scary moments good acting and a good script it wasn t very entertaining either but the movie had cool music fancy locations and hot girls it also works great as a dracula spoof hope it was meant that way although i really don t think so the story focuses on three girls in transylvania awaking an ancient vampire which then terrorizes and kills the girls one by one sounds familiar yes so it does after reading through this you may think that i should have given it a better vote the reason i don t is because i almost felt asleep at some points,0
21149,i wanted to see this movie because i am a very huge abbott and costello fan and when i saw it i liked it this movie is funny not hysterical but funny i mean i laughed at a lot of the funny parts and i just plain enjoyed it though it is not of the best of the perfect straight man and the perfect buffoon you should see this if you really love abbott and costello out of all of the abbott and costello movies that i have seen i can t say i ve seen one that i hated this is decent funny and entertaining abbott and costello at least made some pretty decent movies in their later years all in all i liked this movie it is not one of their best ones but i liked it 7 10,1
23612,i collect films on super 8 and managed to snag a full length print of this one last week on e bay it looks like at least for the moment this is the only way to see this film in a country having ntsc video i have seen it available on region 2 dvd many times but never region 1 i just finished watching it a few minutes ago and i am amazed by it it s a powerful testament to freedom and finding your own place in the world the photography and music were wonderful and i really felt empathy for some of the characters i kind of like the idea that i was probably the only one in the usa watching when the north wind blows tonight long live avakum,1
13202,this movie was very good i really enjoyed it tom mccamus performance was excellent and very believable as the consumptive son edmund i also enjoyed the set design house and the costumes,1
8434,i went to see this because i d never seen tel aviv where the story is set i was disappointed since it doesn t offer many views of israel s largest metropolis it s also pretentious one of those movies that leaves you guessing at its meaning until you ultimately give up with a shrug of the shoulders the main protagonist is batya a woman in her twenties who works as a waitress at catered weddings her parents evidently don t care about her very much and when a little girl walks out of the sea with an inflatable ring around her batya feels compelled to take care of her the little girl doesn t speak and batya can t give her to social services because it s the weekend and the agency is closed so she takes her back to her apartment with the leaky roof and when it comes time to work in the evening she has to take the little girl with her the boss is very unhappy about this and other shortcomings in batya s work performance another main character is keren who is getting married at her wedding party where batya is of course working she breaks her leg climbing out of a ladies room cubicle whose door won t open and so she and her new husband cannot take the caribbean vacation they ve planned they end up in a dingy hotel on the seafront without a view it smells bad there is noise from the traffic and keren is complaining all the time her husband meets a strangely attractive older woman a writer who is also staying in the hotel and keren worries that he has slept with this stranger the third main character is a filipino woman named joy who looks after old people the old woman she is hired to care for is very crabby and speaks no english only german and hebrew joy speaks english but no hebrew or german joy is mostly concerned with how her son is doing back in the philippines and wants to buy him a toy boat as he has asked she finds the perfect boat in a store and plans to buy it the daughter of the old woman who hired joy is an actress appearing in some sort of post modern physical theater adaptation of hamlet and does not get along with her mother the way in which these three stories which intersect momentarily resolve themselves is presumably supposed to mean something profound i didn t get it there is a fantasy element to batya s relationship with the little girl and maybe batya s non existent relationship with her parents is somehow inverted in this relationship when joy sees the toy boat in the shop window there is a strange effect used where the little sails billow as if blown by the wind and they do this as if they are on the scale of a real life ship keren draws the outline of a bottle around a ship that is on a brochure cover in the hotel room and a narration of the strange woman s poetry mentions a ship in a bottle but what does all this mean i thought about it for a while and realized i wasn t going to lose any sleep in the process if anyone out there has a clear idea of what it s all about maybe they can fill me in,0
19670,all i have to say is that this movie is the bomb you are going to cry when you see this i mean this is a reminder for everyone how hard and easy it is to fall in love it reminds you of the days during your youth when you were carefree and everything that was bad for you was washed away with a single kiss even though i am still a teen this is how i live my life when i am with that certain someone everything that was negative in my mind was erased so i give this movie a 10 for it s heartfelt message and touching plot actors josh hartnett and chris klein i also give a 10 for having a cute face,1
24571,one of fuller s a combat veteran himself early works of average quality but accurately hits on the many conflicting aspects of life in postwar germany the main character starts the movie in apr 45 as a sgt with c co 157th inf 45th div which really did end the war in munich as in the movie same unit in the previous month had fought heavily in aschaffenburg and then liberated part of the dachau facility to the uninformed the movie may seem confusing by flip flopping between showing the good bad of the german people but anyone who has been there or at least well read on it would know that most of what is portrayed in the movie are things that really did happen in 45 47 germany the only inaccuracy i noticed was minor while on a boat cruise of the rhine passing the remains of the remagen bridge he comments he crossed there but his unit really crossed well south of there north of worms germany,1
10641,while sporadically engrossing including a few effectively tender moments and humorous the sledgehammer obvious satire homecoming hinges on comes off as forced and ultimately unfulfilling with material like this timing is everything michael moore knew to release fahrenheit 9 11 before the 2004 elections and the real tragedy of dante s film is that it didn t come out 2 years ago when its message would have carried an energy that would have energized the dissidents further in 2006 mockery of the well settled bush administration hardly seems as controversially compelling or imperiled as it did then frankly anyone that could be convinced of anything by a ham fisted zombie flick has questionable intelligence and if you didn t notice michael moore didn t exactly help to defeat bush there was nothing engrossing about this film i just felt disgust at how blatant and frankly stupid the film was it was painful to watch if you are going to do something like this you need a bit of wit sadly this has none a poorly done satire actually has the opposite of its intended effect as they say with friends like these who needs enemies,0
504,it s been over 30 years now but i still remember that this movie was the worst i ve ever seen i would have thought that in this length of time something worse would have been filmed but i was mistaken i just finished watching starship troopers and it came mighty close but it was still more entertaining than poor cow,0
7641,this has got to be the worst movie i have ever seen the part where they loose there daughter with the poltergeist overtone rip off just pushes it over the edge with stupidity i watched it on showtime so it still had the cheese soft core porn scenes in it i have to say it made me laugh my ass off the 80 s 3d effects were very out of place included an invisible cat and a spinning vortex wow i wonder if the people who made this actually feel accomplished in life the actress who plays the wife looks familiar but sucks anyhow her screaming could be used as a torture device in hell for more than retired nazis anyways thank you showtime for the super crappy horror movie i will always enjoy the time i watched the biggest waist of time and money i have ever seen,0

20900,i could never imagine i would start loving movies like this after seeing yimou zhang s hero i decided to check his other movies perhaps looking for something similar the second yimou zhang s movie i watched was no one less after which i realized what kind of cinema i m now in no wonder why i got keep cool immediately it is a simple touching and brilliant piece of cinema i pay my respect to the director this movie shows that it s not the amount of money makes film good it s all about what the director wants to show and how successful he is in doing this the story is very simple a typical extract of a typical daily life moreover shown in a very simple way the movements of camera also strengthen the impression and the feeling of the movie i give a top rating to this film and impatiently waiting to see other yimou zhang s films,1
14028,stephen hawking has one of the greatest minds or if that s too simplistic to coin for him one of the most curious and daring that also happens to be trapped in a body crippled by a disease that leaves him in a wheelchair and a computer to communicate perhaps i didn t know enough about hawking going in i always knew him as that guy speaking like a computer who knows a lot about like the universe and stuff you know that he is british that he was a rather normal kid and perhaps most remarkably the disease that could have possibly left him dead at 21 put him in the position of putting his life in focus according to errol morris s equally curious and coolly visually dazzling portrait in a brief history of time hawking was already brilliant in spurts when other oxford students were faced with daunting algebraic equations he answered more than three times the amount in an hour s time but when faced with challenges mostly from other theories by other scientists he bounced back with his own beneath some of the complex scientific talk and if you got any less than a b in astronomy like me you ll need to keep your ears especially perked up in explanations of time s possible infinity or the peculiarities of the black hole there s a human being who just wants to enjoy his goose on his birthday morris captures hawking just right for those who can t get enough of his theories on how particles may be going in and out of a black hole or if there is even a creator or not depending on how much one takes into account einstein and time but he also captures the back story on the man and his condition which creates this as something much more interesting than if morris had done one or the other too much talk about the cosmos would make one s head hurt and too much about his personal life and one might wonder what all the fuss is about this bloke who s book of the film s title was on bestseller lists for over five years almost in spite of his appearance hawking defines what it is to be a conscious entity in a universe which he observes he won t be apart of if and when the universe goes kaput another 10 billion years from now through it all in a brief history of time we get a glimpse of a genius and his humility not to mention his colleagues and family s ten cents here and there through an unfathomably hypothetical and mathematical thought process of the universe,1
10343,this film sucks it looks like they just chose to place scenes together at random good gore but little plot sally whines and complains about everything till she becomes a demon i figured that she had pms it sure seemed that way the dubbing in this film is horrible one scene the woman was talking and a few seconds before we hear any audio i knew at that moment my suspicions were correct that it was not from the us i tried to follow along but got lost about half way through it and found it very hard to believe even for a horror film some good characters but not many not worth wasting one s time,0
20218,love jones is one of the best movies i ve experienced the main element that sticks out to me is the fact that it is very well directed i have studied this film in it s entirety with watching movies more than once certain things dawn on you subconsciously the direction of this movie as well as the writing is chic hip and artful i am in love with the direction the scene where larenz tate and nia long are riding the motorcycle through north chicago at night is astonishing the director of this movie deserved awards for his great job love jones is a classy and sexy film it highlights the fact that we can be people who love who have flaws who love living learning and just being us without the hype being our natural selves the poetry is wonderful but the story line the dialog and the scenes really make this movie this movie deserves to be seen it is a great movie for lovers and friends to sit back and watch or the hopeless romantic like myself to sit back and enjoy alone on a friday or saturday night any day of the week where peace solitude and a little entertainment is needed love jones is what i recommend,1
5622,a roger corman rip off assembled for what appears to be virtually zero budget all of the special effects were originally used in battle beyond the stars and i suspect a fair amount of the props costumes and sets were re used from other sources as well the story seems to have been written around these elements so this isn t really a movie as much as it s a recycling project third rate star wars junk wasn t needed then or now,0
1069,i generally love this type of movie however this time i found myself wanting to kick the screen since i can t do that i will just complain about it this was absolutely idiotic the things that happen with the dead kids are very cool but the alive people are absolute idiots i am a grown man pretty big and i can defend myself well however i would not do half the stuff the little girl does in this movie also the mother in this movie is reckless with her children to the point of neglect i wish i wasn t so angry about her and her actions because i would have otherwise enjoyed the flick what a number she was take my advise and fast forward through everything you see her do until the end also is anyone else getting sick of watching movies that are filmed so dark anymore one can hardly see what is being filmed as an audience we are impossibly involved with the actions on the screen so then why the hell can t we have night vision,0
18507,one of the great things about the best years of our lives that even though it dates itself rather firmly in the post world war ii era the issues it talks about are as real today as they were on v e or v j day of 1945 the problem of how to assimilate returning war veterans is as old as the written history of our planet and while we don t often learn from history we can be thankful that for once the united states of america did learn from what happened with its veterans after the previous world war the gi bill of rights is mentioned in passing in the best years of our lives was possibly the greatest piece of social legislation from the last century so many veterans did take advantage of it as do the veterans like fredric march dana andrews and harold russell who you see here all three of those actors played archetypal veterans characters that every corner of the usa could identify with they all meet on an army transport plane flying to the home town of all of them boone city iowa war is a great leveler of class and distinction bank employee march soda jerk andrews and high school football star russell probably would never meet in real life even in a small town like boone city but they do meet and war forges indestructible bonds that can never be broken march is the oldest a man with two children and hollywood s perfect wife myrna loy he settles in the first and the best he has some wonderful scenes getting cockeyed drunk on his return and later with a little bit of liquor in him tells the bank officials at a banquet off in no uncertain terms i also love his scene where another returning veteran a sharecropper wants to get a bank loan for his own piece of land watch march s expressions as he listens to the man s pitch for money you can feel him read the man s soul it s what got him his second best actor oscar for this film harold russell was a real veteran who lost both his hands during service in the pacific he got a special recognition oscar for his performance because of that it was probably unfair to nominate him in the supporting actor category which he also won in his performance especially his scenes with cathy o donnell as his sweetheart who loves him with or without his hands is beyond anything that could be described as acting dana andrews is the only officer of the three a bombardier in the army air corps of the group of them maybe he should have stayed in he also comes from the poorest background of the group and he was an officer and a gentleman in that uniform that uniform and those monthly allotment checks are what got virginia mayo interested enough to marry him the problem is that he s considerably less in her eyes as a civilian while mayo is fooling around with steve cochran andrews has the great good fortune to have march s daughter teresa wright take an interest in him they re the main story of the film andrews adjustment to civilian life and adjusting to the fact he married the wrong woman not all veteran s problems were solved with gi bill myrna loy gets little recognition for the best years of our lives my guess is that it s because her role as wife was too much like the stereotypical wife roles she had patented over at mgm still as wife to march and mother to wright she really is the glue that holds that family together the best years of our lives won for best picture for sam goldwyn best director for william wyler and a few others besides the two acting oscars it got it was a critical and popular success possibly the best film sam goldwyn ever produced it remains to this day an endearing and enduring classic and will be so for centuries it s almost three hours in length but never once will your interest wane the best tribute this film received came from frank capra who had a film of his own in the oscar sweepstakes that year in several categories in his memoirs he said that he was disappointed to be skunked at the oscars that year but that his friend and colleague william wyler had created such a masterpiece he deserved every award he could get for it by the way the film capra had hopes for was it s a wonderful life the beat years of our lives can t get better praise than that,1
19811,it is characteristic that this film is not better known it obviously lacks most elements that a successful theater film needs heroes villains conflict and resolution romantic love interest everything is topsy turvy here nothing works out as it should everyone is clumsy sad angry hurt and hungry and nobody has a solution for anything in short it is war and it is hell for everybody involved people try to do best but interests allegiances and so called duty interfere the picture transports us back in time to the civil war with an intensity seldom seen in today s cinema straightforward honest images of an intense beauty the actors are very well cast for the story and they make the characters come truly alive in front of our eyes a silver dollar in a heap of nickels,1
24705,spoiler alert i have never seen comments on a movie that i disagree with more then the comments people made on this one could learn from critical viewings of this movie as an educational film i rate it highly because it teaches how to succeed we do not watch movies to learn we generally watch for entertainment as entertainment i rate it low the ending is downbeat and cerebral intellectual this conflict results in my eight star rating the movie follows jane craig holly hunter a television news producer the network executive introduces tom grunnick william hurt to study for the on air news anchor position tom immediately charms people with humbleness another potential news anchor has been waiting for years for his on air opportunity aaron altman albert brooks altman knows all news stories inside and out the network executive wants grunnick on the air and jane argues saying grunnick is not ready he doesn t know the news they do not listen to her forced to place grunnick on the air jane contacts altman to get information on the news story and relays altman s comments through an earpiece to grunnick while grunnick speaks we watch the sharp contrast between altman s jane craig s words and grunnick s as grunnick skillfully rewords everything altman and jane craig say in his ear in order to make it understandable likable and entertaining the audience altman gets a chance on air and the network execs require him to seek coaching from grunnick the new guy this new news ingnorant guy coaching him this is something altman does not see justified but agrees reluctantly grunnick coaches altman and gets excited noting hundreds of altman s shortcomings in appearance audio and vocabulary altman never considered these things before when he became an expert on the news itself the complexity of understanding what grunnick taught him causes altman to have a panicked sweating attack flop sweat when he is on the air grunnick eventually becomes the top network anchor and altman resigns prior to being fired but grunnick fails in his attempt for a romance with jane craig because she finds out from altman that grunnick sometimes fakes circumstances in order to make people like him this turns her off of him this sends the message that in relationships we want people who are genuine and not trying to make us like them this movie sends the message that getting people to like you is the most important skill in a job but it is especially true in broadcast news there are many people commenting on how this is the dumbing down of tv news and how grunnick represents a good looking but dumb guy or all style but no substance the opposite is true grunnick possessed skills and very complex intellect to get people to like him including the presence of mind to know exactly how he appears and sounds when he is on camera he coaches altman to punch a word in every sentence grunnick s flaw that costs him the relationship with jane craig is that he is too driven to be likable and will fake a situation many people are calling altman very intelligent or brilliant altman played by brookes is not as intelligent as grunnick and the flop sweat scene shows that his mind could not handle the complexity that grunnick handles when on the air altman is angered by this fact that he knew the news and grunnick suceeded more by getting people to like him there are also people commenting that these things are exclusive to the tv news industry the concept that winning friends is the most important skill in a job is obviously not popular but my experience indicates it is true in most jobs as an education on how to succeed this movie is fantastic albeit unpopular educational yes but it does not have an uplifting ending,1
21749,okay maybe it was because i happen to be in yangchun china when i saw this movie maybe it was because i finally had something on tv i could understand or at least read the subtitles or maybe it was just funny whatever it was this movie was worth the time i had just arrived for my foot and head massage when they gave me the remote so i could watch tv usually i would turn the darn thing off but i stumbled upon this crazy movie and got hooked the plot if you could call it a plot sort of revolves around a cooking competition and sort of is a love story and the food in this movie is the real star if you like iron chef and many of the other cooking shows currently in the reality tv mode then you will love the scenes with food in this movie it goes fast and the subtitles are so fast you better be up on speed reading for this one however the action is mostly slapstick so you don t always have to read the entire subtitle to get the idea the main actress is lovely eye candy and the main actor isn t bad to look at either they are both worth watching finally if you have some time to kill and want a good laugh this isn t a bad choice for both i don t speak a word of chinese but i was totally able to understand the cultural humor of this film for those who do speak chinese maybe it is even better overall i give this an 8 out of 10 and currently i am even looking to find a copy to have while i stay in china and keep for when i come back home it will be a nice reminder for me of my time in yangchun and a silly afternoon at the massage salon watching a silly movie,1
15440,spoilers spoilers spoilers just a few small ones saw this on satilite channel missed the first 30 min of movie will keep this comment short and informative the movie is basically about 5 characters the acting is very bad for afew characters 1 girl with the help of another girl kidnaps 3 different people but it backfires and the 3 kidnap the 2 this is one of those types of movies where the script writers try to be thought provoking or philosophical mysterious and you get the point but do to their own personal lack in thinking they fall terribly short like one of the captives who is supposed to be some type of psychology nerd looks the part but his tongue can t speak it the writers think that if the nerd uses a lot of 8 letter words amateurishly unknowingly i believe that the viewers will be ignorant enough to believe it i wish i could give an example but i cant recall any exactly as it was said the ending was bad as well but the one female captive acted her role as an old and relatively wise lady although she as well as the rest had a lot of clich s so why would i give this movie a 7 stars if i thought all the above simple i give the entire seven stars to lisa keller one sexy a momma she is fine lol i am an appreciator of beauty and she is exactly that but don t get me confused because i m not a pervert and this movie is not a porno in any way their is somethin about her i cant explain but i like it i remember the scene where a captive has broke free and as he looks for a way out bumps into keller she tries to get way but she doesn t have a chance he throws her down kneeling on the stairs and he pulls her pants down no panties now although she has an amazing ass and the this shot leaves little to the imagination for a long 30 seconds i think it was her facial expression that got me she wanted it and that look had me thinking i was behind that i would have torn that booty up after that expression i jus couldn t look at her objectively anymore i was in love lol i am glad to have seen this movie but if lisa keller wasn t playing the lead role i would have changed the channel well after i had seen the scene i mentioned above i am a lisa keller fan know but is seems that she isn t a consistent actor seeing this 2003 movie is her latest but i am lookin forward to another movie with her in it,1
1930,i had nothing to do before going out one night so i didn t want to watch anything too heavy i picked the perfect film this must have been a gift to barrymore from someone she slept with the director raja gosnell has made nothing but silly crap and the writing on this one is just atrocious in what high school can you register without a parent present and no proof of age or former schooling they let kids all come to the prom with no shirts in skin tight leotards ass shorts and one girl was dressed as eve wearing only fig leaves she announces that she s 25 and her brother is 23 but there is no reprisal from the school parents or lawsuits of any kind against the newspaper for fraud or spying the newspaper boss wants to catch the teacher in an underage sex scandal but doesn t realize the teacher is coming on to a 25 year old so any case would be entrapment they allow a camera in and record peoples private conversations with under age kids i wonder if i hired my younger sister to go back to hs with a camera on her and filmed under age girls for my personnel use i would not get in some kind of trouble nahhhh no problem didn t she have to take gym or go to the bathroom at some point the secondary characters in this were like cardboard cutouts of what high school students are thought to be and everybody was a stereotype jessica alba is just embarrassingly bad in this mugging for the camera at every chance in what world do the parents not get suspicious when their uber geeky daughter is miraculously asked out by the school stud to the prom and they don t ask the guy inside to meet him like every other parent in history if some guy in my school or any other school for that matter had conned my sister and thrown eggs at her in her prom dress he would have been in a body cast for the rest of his life this movie is so contrived and predictable it s nauseating and why at the end is everybody the alpo girls included cheering for this chick when two days before they hated her dumb dumb and dumb,0
3472,would a different translation have made it chillier or scarier are the subtitles too compact to convey the nuances of the original language does it even matter you may have heard that great actors can make reading a phone book exciting well this is an opportunity to judge for yourself if this isn t about homosexuality murder dismemberment psychopaths insanity deviant psychology then it is about acting acting helped along with lots of dialog so enjoy the acting or muse about how titillating the dialog actually is for english speakers twelve angry men might be a better choice there s a bit more interaction and you can judge if the acting is consistent with the dialog you don t have to wonder if you re missing something i would recommend andy warhol s empire to those who like this film,0
24132,i cannot for the life of me understand why the rating here for this movie is so low this was one of the most beautiful films i have seen this year it really struck a chord with me i had been anticipating this film for several months and i thought to myself there s no way it can possibly live up to the expectations i had for it seeing as how i built it up in my head as much as i did well needless to say not only did it meet my expectations but it far surpassed them jordana brewster and cameron diaz were excellent in every way their acting superb by far they were both in their element and completely natural for the roles the locales were absolutely gorgeous every shot filmed was perfectly captured and fit the mood and atmosphere beautifully i found this film very touching and took it very close to heart i would even contemplate saying this could be one of my all time favorites at the very least certainly i could see it again and again i swear i couldn t find one fault in this film it s hard to say that about any film i would highly recommend this one it s touching it s meaningful and it says a lot about human nature and family 10 out of 10 well done by all,1
1016,this oddity contains bunuel like touches but doesn t sustain one s interest a 10 year old roams a bizarro america in a stolen mustang while the usual cult movie suspects dick miller mary woronov susie tyrell commit malicious acts in the name of comedy like his after hours and vampire s kiss the screenwriter delights in making you squirm i remained unaffected due to the broad acting you know you re in for it when meat loaf and flea give the most appealing perfs and what did this kid s screen test look like he s insufferable recommended to the dozen or so fans of sonny boy 87,0
10948,you may not believe this but when the credits to this movie rolled i looked for the director s name when i saw it i burned it into my memory and i never forgot it this movie is beyond terrible it makes ed wood s films look like orsen welles at least b movies are entertaining this was a soul deadening experience the quality was so bad i began to wonder who allowed this to happen i hear uwe boll runs fourteen miles a day this is because wherever his movies are viewed the people must run him out of town with flame and pitchfork the script was terrible the lighting was like that of a high school football game and the cinematography was just above the quality of roger patterson s bigfoot video the acting was executed by people too ashamed of the production to say their lines with any credibility in the end was a film alan smithee wouldn t have put his name on i learned that day to avoid any movie by this man despite the circumstances from what i hear this is not a bad thing to do,0
19707,plunkett macleane falls into my favourite genre of film historical action adventure with comedy which is probably why i rate it so highly the action centres around a highwayman plunkett and a layabout gentleman who gets entangled with him and his schemes macleane this leads to all sorts of escapades and adventures which are all tinged with comedy there is also of course a love interest the rest of the cast is made up of a number of vibrant larger than life characters who add to the atmosphere of the film and show the excesses of the wealthy at this time this is an enjoyable film with a fairly simple but worthwhile plot that provides plenty of entertainment,1
6235,here s what s good about the slaughter rule ryan gosling clea duvall and david morse all give great performances gosling is as always pretty darn outstanding the locales are often breathtaking here s what s bad about the slaughter rule everything else the script is horribly muddled and while i can certainly appreciate a non feel good movie this movie is just boring great performances can t make up for a movie with a stupid premise and a script that is filled with throw away lines that often don t even make it sense just getting through the first hour became a chore i stuck with it because of gosling but eventually i did myself a favor and changed the channel spoilers on here relayed the ending to me i didn t miss much do yourself a favor if you want a good gosling flick check out the believer my score 2 out of 10,0
11935,wow what a cheesy movie this is it starts off looking like it s gonna be a backwoods slasher with the camera following dogs running through the woods it then gets a bit boring and follows the story of some girls moving into some house haunted by indian spirits we then get plenty of shots of one partially clad girl and another naked girl in the bath it suddenly gets really cheesy when the zombie indians arise from the earth and start terrorising the girls we even get a samurai indian this movie starts off pretty boring although i did find the story of the four indians who buried themselves alive quite interesting once the indian zombies or whatever you want to call them for they aren t technically zombies start terrorising the girls is when all the fun begins this is not a special flick and can t be taken seriously it s just something fun to watch when you re bored or when you re drinking with friends i can t help thinking though that it would have worked better as a short story because the first half is tediously boring,0
16097,so often these lifetime flicks are one dimension with over the top characterizations and performances and with contrived plot lines and climaxes which are intended to trade any semblance of reality for drama but most of all many of these flicks provide characters where it s difficult to feel a trace of sympathy or empathy for even the good guy good gal characters much less the bad ones however here the performance were all good the characters realistic and the relationships among the three leads as well as the ex husband father and the two females rang true throughout the mother s boyfriend was portrayed as being about halfway in age between mother and daughter and the actors were age appropriate to this in term of their actual ages none of the characters was portrayed at an extreme either all good or all bad and all rang true without in any way condoning his allowing the relationship with his prospective stepdaughter to advance to the level which it did you can still feel some sympathy for him without retracting blame neither mother nor daughter were perfect neither good nor bad but simply two individuals whose relationship seemed realistic and not contrived by the script writer lifetime flicks even those which begin with some semblance of normality often end with a deranged character brandishing a carving knife or such other stories seem to need to provide the everyone lived happily ever after close this film presented a realistic premise story and resolution from start to finish a welcomed variation to the norm of this genre,1
21492,man is it great just to see young and the restless star melody thomas scott as something other than flighty nikki newman a doctor with a brain no less and super nice to see her with the likes of the gorgeous lorenzo lamas instead of victor newman mel plays a college professor of micro biology who goes to the islands with her son for spring break only to find herself a prisoner of the island infested with a rapidly spreading virus handy for her there is the hunky character played by lorenzo who has a daughter just her son s age mel shines as does lorenzo with a bit of the overacting from the younger couple interesting premise in these times of chemical and biological terrorism talk worthwhile seeing especially for y r fans,1
18557,just watched this film on tv and it was awesome had just planned on watching it whilst doing some work however i ended up watching the whole film with out doing work as it was so good actors my not be very well know but the story line makes up for it the fact that the actors make are less well known only makes it more believable that the events could occur i did not feel a biased towards one character as i have no judgement of the types of character as i have never seen any of the actors in a film before which made it even more enjoyable would recommend watching it,1
20562,there is a version of nevsky that is shown with a live symphony orchestra chorus soloist and the movie if it s ever performed within a day s travel of you see nevsky done that way the oklahoma city philharmonic did it with the okc canterbury choir one of the finest anywhere a couple of years ago i think i cried through the whole thing it was one of the most emotionally powerful movie experiences of my life i m listening to nevsky on the radio right now and it still tears me up there are movies that i love and classical music pieces i love but there is no combination i can think of that comes close to the impact of nevsky performed in real time,1
9183,i suggest if you have already seen the original american graffiti do not see this movie if you haven t seen the original i still don t recommend this but it will be a lot less painful to watch the characters from the first film are great and by the end you fell a connection to them this movie sets out to show how bad their lives have become it s a chore to watch set on new year s eve in 1964 65 66 and 67 we have four stories about the characters from the first film in 64 we have john milner paul le mat who is now a professional drag racer he meets a foreign girl eva and though his plot really goes nowhere it s the best of the four in 1965 we have toad charles martin smith who is stuck in vietnam and more than anything he wants out he tries to find ways to hurt himself or do stupid things to get out in 66 we have debbie candy clark the girl who toad picked up in the first movie now she is a pot smoking hippie and really i m not sure what her plot was about it was her going to a concert not much of anything happened finally in 1967 steve bolander ron howard and laurie bolander cindy williams are having marriage problems that end in a anti war rally and police action none of these stories are very good the script in some parts features very very bad dialogue these poor characters who i enjoyed so much in the first film ended up where they are here why why was this sequel made i guess if a sequel was made it had to feature the vietnam war and hippies and police action but the real thing is that this movie shouldn t have been made the direction was stylish but it just amounts in a huge headache each story has a different style milner s is just a regular depending on how you watch it wide screen and is filmed how the rest of the movie should be toad s plot was shot in 16mm and what it amounts to is a poor looking picture which is the size of a small box in the middle of the screen debbie s plot is shot in multi screen at one point there might have been one screen but for the good majority it s anywhere from two to twenty screens up at once don t bother trying to follow the screens since there s nothing going on anyways steve and laurie s plot has the weirdest filming style it s style really doesn t mean anything and is dumb and pointless instead of just a full widescreen it s a condensed widescreen that looks like a full screen version of widescreen though i don t like the others at least i understand what they were going for this one just doesn t make sense the music is this movie s saving grace not that it could save this bob dylan simon and grafunkel stevie wonder marvin gaye and dozens of others have nice songs featured here they don t save the feature they just make it a little better than it is it s still bad overall this is a pointless sequel any fan of the original should avoid this lackluster sequel my rating 1 2 out of 110 mins pg for language drug use and violence,0
16128,too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters i had never heard of it when it appeared on cable after the first shock of realizing this is not like any other movie you have seen since bringing up baby you have to let it sweep you along and run with it not until it s over do you realize it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant alienation denial wish fulfillment for a start cathy bates owns this movie she s never been better the whole cast has the feel of the plot and knows what they re doing without laying on gratuitous hamming except where it s called for as with julie andrews bits or jonathan pryce s camp videos if you re not open minded you won t get it see mark adnum s bizarre review which he devotes to adulation of stephanie beacham her career and her brother s obe for introducing vegetable oil or something to island natives taking that as a cue i might as well spend time eulogizing amo gulinello s stellar cameo as a tv station intern or jack noseworthy s shower scene so cast aside all previous concepts of film comedy and have a good time i loved it,1
7208,thirty per cent of this movie appears to be the prototype for the map channel you see a giant map for about ten minutes then they unleash the stock footage big time while droning droning get it on about radar apparently there s a lot of radar stations in the far north protecting north america s borders from attacks by deadly polar bears the bears never show up but a giant mantis does it was frozen in the ice for over a million years or so until it was released by an earthquake somewhere else in the world yeah right for my money it was released by global warming it is a huge prehistoric insect and it needs lots of food since there aren t any cows in the frozen north it decides to feast on the most bovine like creatures it can find up there i e human beings it starts attacking radar stations probably because the humming from the radar dishes was getting on its nerves enter col joe parkman the resident smarmy guy of the film he s investigating a plane that went down and is puzzled why there are no bodies in the wreckage the only thing he finds is one of the claws of the mantis apparently it decided to trim its nails while it was snacking on the plane s crew parkman takes the claw tip back with him to be analyzed by a thousand year old scientist grandpa scientist can t make heads or tails of the claw mostly because he s missed his naps so his mind isn t functioning too well so he calls in a smug paleontologist played by the guy who was the p i in perry mason he and his friend a transvestite photographer fly north because he s decided that the claw must have come from a praying mantis just one the size of a commuter train it s luke warm love at first sight when col parkman first sets eyes on the she male photographer the men at the base obviously having been deprived for many years think she s the hottest thing to come along since granny clampett smug science guy and smarmy soldier guy start working together to track the path of the mantis which has devastated some stock footage of an eskimo village it comes to the base looking for an after dinner snack and crushes some cheap sets quite effectively then it flies south and disappears now comes the tense hours when the civilian ground observer core are called on to sweep the skies looking for anything large flying overhead i doubt that in reality they would have been told that they were looking for a giant flying mantis that eats human beings since that would haver caused a panic probably they were told to look for a giant 727 that was painted green and hummed because its engine was out of tune col parkman goes up in a plane to try to shoot the mantis down and botches the mission the mantis lands in new york city probably because it wanted to take in a show on broadway or visit sex world in times square the army corners it in the tunnel and parkman and his men don stupid suits that they borrowed from the orkin man to go in and try to blow the mantis up success well almost since the mantis is still twitching enough that it almost kills the mannish eve arden photographer lady there s a tepid love scene at the end and the paleontologist takes a picture of the dead mantis because colonel hair grease and ms gender unspecified are busy smooching so kind of a nauseating ending,0
21100,i must say this is the best movie i have ever seen i know that on this website it s received only negative reviews but for once i d like to be the good person who gives the worlds best movie a good review i find the movie to be extremely funny and it has the perfect mix of everything it makes me feel all sorts of emotions when i watch it and i can t get enough of it the soundtracks brilliant i love it i understand why people may not love it as much as i do but i don t understand how people could hate it the movie is 100 brilliance blurred is amazing i never realised that aussie movies could be so good and i also never realised i could watch one movie so many times in a single day without getting sick of it i think that everybody should watch it whether its to get a feel of what life was like in the younger days or if its to see what your in for when you reach the end of year 12,1
13991,otto preminger s the man with the golden arm is a reference to heroin addiction something that must have been rather risky to film back in 1955 fifty years ago the censors today still have a problem with drug content in films the lead role was originally offered to marlon brando then snatched by frank sinatra before brando could respond sinatra convincingly portrays a pro card dealer and ex heroin addict who returns home to the city only to find himself battling the demons of temptation preminger is one of my favorite directors his anatomy of a murder starring james stewart is a brilliant and revolutionary courtroom drama preminger pretty much helped change the face of cinema back in the 50s anatomy of a murder was extremely controversial when it came out due to both its plot and content references to rape women s panties seduction etc and the man with the golden arm deals with a topic that is equally volatile however preminger pulls it off without becoming exploitative this is like a forerunner to the panic in needle park 1971 and bears more than a few similarities in terms of general motifs to the classic billy wilder movie lost weekend starring ray milland these three films in particular are probably the best movies about alcoholism predating the 1980s and still remain relevant today,1
10011,tyra the rest of the modeling world needs to know that real women like myself and my daughter don t care to see all the ridiculous modeling to sell something weird locations too much makeup too much skin is not necessary sex does not always sell when you are selling to women the same goes for the horse stomping runway walk that looks unnatural people come in all shapes sizes they need to have that on the show my daughter has a 36 inseam is tall slender a size 5 i am more average at a size 12 we would like to see both i can not picture how something would look on me when a size 2 is wearing it it will not fit the same way on me i do not buy magazines anymore because they are one sided on this matter we would really love the show to consider women of all sizes thank you,0
878,don t be greedy sums up the depth of this movie all the rest of the baloney is big budget window dressing the movie rotates through hiding the ball annoyingly and revealing too much none of the potentially interesting plot tangents are developed yet the trite ones are hashed and rehashed to excess the charm of dd as others have pointed out was in the schizophrenia device the humor woven into the fabric of the movie and most importantly the acting there is enough wooden acting in the box to attract a giant mound of martian termites the biggest problem with suspending disbelief during this mess is the glaring question why would a technologically superior power capable of taking over the government need to do any testing at all awful failure of a movie,0
16126,ignore everyone else s comments for this movie and watch it on pay cable like i did or rent it you owe it to yourself this film is what movies are supposed to be all about hard to categorize and god knows how this was pitched as a high concept but this is one for the angels check it out what have you got to lose,1
8915,this film is just another waste of time the plot is ridiculous forced usa drama the characters were all really weak especially the uncharismatic goya and the bad interpretation of bardem who only was alright in his classic interpretation when acting as french ally just another chance lost of have spent the money in a good film i guess it was no a low budget film definitely not recommended maybe the director s should think a bit whether the film has sense or not before wasting so that money maybe they do not bother as they have profits before launching them in the cinema no more hope in cinema,0
23357,this film is totally mindblowing it manages to be thought provoking funny tragic and cinematic yet claustrophobic although the flashbacks are unnecessary the film maintains a pacy punchy grip and the performances are all excellent in particular alec baldwin and the mesmerising eric bogosian as the film s anti hero barry champlain,1
21066,the first thing you see in this film is a static angle one which will be repeated later in the film depicting the chaos going on unseen to the audience in a studio that airs news soon after fonda s character s typical story is shown in that same angle don t let this mislead you the film is not about a female reporter a woman struggling to succeed in a male dominated profession that is merely a lead in a way of starting the film though it s used later the actual point to this production is revealed gradually and the first we see of it is in a deliberately long scene early on the entire film has that pace not slow or drawn out but deliberate it s never really fast even in the few sequences that one would normally expect to be so this pacing especially because it seems to slow down further as the plot is revealed as the disturbing unsettling nature of the film is unraveled is strong almost painful to the viewer it inspires you to if it had been possible jump into the screen grab the people responsible by the collar and yell at them to do something about it to remedy the situation never once did i feel like getting up or even taking my eyes off the screen for a moment the subject is extremely important to be aware of and it s handled perfectly here no over dramatization well very little anyway just an accurate presentation of the issue the direction is astounding the empathy felt for lemmon s character is profound the editing is masterful one scene near the very end illustrates that perfectly the editor judging from his filmography is vastly underrated the writing was excellent the acting was great in particular by lemmon fonda and douglas who also produced it the lack of a score is perfect no music is needed to enhance the ending is sublime and effective the movie does have a few negative points among them some of the dialog is obviously and undeniably mainly exposition one particular part of the film whilst dramatic doesn t seem to mesh with something that follows it not everyone will watch the film because of two features of it which are commonly and rightfully so attributed to bad movies the pacing which can be mistaken as being slow and the lack of score one could argue that to be a negative thing as everyone ought to consider the points it presents but maybe it s better this way handling the heavy subject with the intelligence and respect for the topic as well as the viewer something like this maybe it shouldn t be spoon fed i was mesmerized with the film and left very taken aback i recommend this to anyone who believe themselves strong enough to handle it 9 10,1
1120,possable spoiler but probably not the game is called donkey kong but donkey kong is not even in itanymore diddy is gone aswell the 1st donkey kong country was one of my two all time favoritesuper nintendo games the other being super mario world the 2nd donkey kong at least had diddy kong and good levels although it felt more like a game based on pirates at times however this one is the worst of the lot it does not have the feel ofthe original or 2nd the enemy s look stupid and the levels areeven worse it does not look realistic anymore i did not enjoy his game unlike the last two the first had greatbackground music and the 2nd was not bad but the music in thisgame is horrible it happens a lot these days that movies shows and sometimesvideo games that start out fantastic end up with it being ruined bya stupid sequel i am sad to say i feel that donkey kong as a saga is not as goodnow that it has donkey kong 3 they should have left it at the original or maybe the 2nd one,0
3748,i accidentally caught this in the middle flipping channels i immediately recognized almost everyone in the cast groovy haircuts aside and wondered what kind of film could attract such a cast of both past and future stars having not seen the original i guessed it might be the poseidon adventure since it was obviously on a ship in distress was i wrong i cannot for the life of me imagine why any of these great or promising actors and actresses would allow their name to be associated with such trash there is no story the performances all looked forced the characters a parody of the usual disaster movie roles that are suddenly brought together by an event and start pontificating about the real meaning of life at the level of bumper sticker philosophy it is only worthwhile to see the unusually awful performances by such greats as sally field michael caine et al they must have needed the money badly can we blame the director,0
10136,mind you it s not supposed to be but it is as a wee tot i watched this movie in the theatre being a huge wrestling and hulk hogan fan all i remember from the night is we were the only ones in the theater and that i didn t really like it very much i blacked the rest out and for good reason a poor film on par with the greats like gymkata and the pumaman no holds barred is a movie set in the high stakes world of pro wrestling well maybe the stakes aren t all that high and quite frankly i feel dirty just calling these people professionals at anything and really except for the first scene there s no wrestling to speak of so i guess movie is about the marginally low stakes world of amateurish beating the c out of people sounds good right hulk hogan plays rip the champion of the wwf never let it be said that hulk hogan was typecast this and movies like thunder in paradise showed how he challenged himself with deep roles that really pushed the limits of his talents essentially he s playing himself but with a wardrobe that s more black and blue than the hulkster s red and yellow he also has this hand gesture he does it s kinda like the ozzy devil sign people make at rock concerts except you stick your thumb in the air and you curl your index finger in my friend claimed that it was supposed to look like an r try and see for yourself if that looks like an r well then mars needs women but anyway kurt fuller with his overacting detector obviously on the fritz plays a tv exec with his slightly homoerotic heart set on getting rip who s evidentally bigger than elvis on his network he won t have any of it and exits the office with a triumphant hand gesture to no one but the camera and so the movie follows fuller trying to boost ratings and get back at rip he does so when he creates his brilliantly titled battle of the tough guys marketing genius this guy from the numerous hand gestures to the rather idiotic fight scenes all played as if wrestling is very real and deadly serious to the overacting to the far too frequent shots of hulk in nothing but undies this movie has everything you d ever want in a dumb movie it s frivolous not too taxing on the mind violent and includes the phrase what s that smell dookie dookie a classic for all time,0
17846,i absolutely positively loved the movie i just saw it and can t wait for it to come out on dvd it is a beautifully well drawn masterpiece i am always amazed with the intricately drawn work of ghibli studios others have commented on sosuke calling risa by her first name he never calls his father by his first name unless he is speaking about him to someone else i didn t get the impression that risa was his mother it was never even mentioned or implied by anyone it is quite obvious that she is his step mother that is why he makes her promise to come home and why he gets so upset when he finds her empty car his mother must have died when he was an infant because he mentions being nursed by risa this coupled with his father being out to sea a lot is why he has abandonment issues everyone also talks about how mature he is this usually occurs when a child loses a parent,1
21238,this film has a brilliant soundtrack and superb acting from some pretty unknown faces i especially like the welsh docklands bad boy characters in it who strut around like american rappers acting tough the banter between jip and koop is brilliant they come across as being best mates almost as if it were true in real life i have experienced some of the things in this film and let me tell you first hand these folks ain t acting especially the seen with jip and koop talking and snorting coke danny dyer is priceless as moff the party prescription dealer and has the funniest lines in the film i m happiest when i m off my pickle feeling the music you get me yeaahhh i knew you wouldn t let me down i knew it,1
10406,if you re like me and you occasionally enjoy watching terrible movies i guess it s kind of like slowing down at a car crash you can t do better than this the plot is inane the special effects are hilarious and the acting is some of the worst you ll ever see 4 thumbs down wooohoooooooo seriously i have no idea how the director and the actors can sleep at night it s painful and yet hysterically funny to watch and i highly recommend it for those who want to punish themselves for something if you can watch this crap without wincing you re a better man than i ll ever be i wonder if the producer of this garbage had any idea what he was getting himself and his money into,0
24708,early 80 s creature feature concerns a long abandoned gold mine that some intrepid miners are determined to check out naturally they find no gold down there but one very hungry monster that slithers along in search of prey while i have to be honest and admit i found it dull at first i personally prefer the thematically similar the boogens it actually grew on me as it went along now the characters aren t too interesting nor the actors either the closest to an interesting character is morgan played by keith hurt in any event female lead terri berland is quite good looking and rolf theison makes his domineering jerk an easy person to hate the writer played by effects man mark sawicki wears thin quickly it begins in a comfortably predictable enough way with a nighttime set piece in which two victims are claimed to get things off to an acceptable start the monster itself is intriguing for its design as you can imagine it gets revealed a bit at a time until late in the game and for being the product of stop motion animation when this process was no longer used very much director melanie anne phillips directing under the pseudonym of david michael hillman and crew deserve some credit for their creation of atmosphere they manage to make the film look quite claustrophobic and gloomy and their use of lighting works well the film does build in intensity towards a pretty good ending suffice it to say they do the best they can on their low budget an obscure little item worth looking into for die hard horror buffs 7 10,1
11762,the hindi remake of mrs doubtfire starring and directed by kamal hassan is a somewhat shoddy version and not as good as expected kamal hassan clearly struggles with hindi dialogs even after all these years and cannot handle even one scene effortlessly the guy has aged and should give it a rest hassan doesn t bring anything new to the role or to the character as say dustin hoffman does to tootsie or marathi actor macchindranath kambli does to mavshi s aunt s character in moruchi mavshi moru s auntie comedy play what was the kid doing playing with firecrackers when it wasn t diwali most of chachi s romantic cross connections vs amrish paresh and then johny walker seem redundant to the main storyline tabu s bathing scene was unnecessary the family is north indian but must be reminded of karva chauth night by a maharashtrian chachi yeah right the fine acting skills of not one but four actors namely tabu om puri the late amrish puri and paresh rawal have been wasted in this film watch the original mrs doubtfire clean crisp and crackling with fun quite unlike chachi 420,0
364,what a ridiculous waste of time and money this movie was the biggest loser of the year all the hype was a warning i am disappointed for julia roberts by far she is the most talented cast member i think her ability to truly act carried the film the buddy buddy boys club was a little too phony and to add insult to injury why bother to cast catherine zeta jones she only has the ability to ruin a film she lacks the ability to have on screen chemistry with anyone not to mention she lacks the ability to act she lacks chemistry with the other characters kind of reminiscent of america s sweetheart s she made the terminal terminal this movie is headed nowhere what a shame please please don t tell me 13 is on the way,0
23598,viewing both of these films concurrently is not a bad idea to get a sense of early film production and acting for the camera styles i give the nod to garbo but not by much in regard to her naturalness robeson is majestic but his performance is aimed for a large proscenium theater something else that struck me was the movies themes of empowerment for women and minorities there hadn t been any films coming out of hollywood yet that allowed the voices of marginal characters like anna and brutus to take the foreground these were very progressive films for their time it s quite probable that o neill saw the writing on the wall way before everyone else did about the future of america,1
15783,the movie is made in a style that resembles lock stock and two smoking barrels with lot s of subplots fancy camerawork cool music and that great tongue in cheek aussie type of humor you ll find nowhere else how this movie has escaped the european and american audience is a mystery,1
13089,anyone that is looking for an episode of law and order or csi would have to look elsewhere as the most basic elements of police or forensics work were totally ignored in this case a murder took place and all the police did was to grab a 15 year old boy off the street and take him to the only witness a 65 year old man and say is this the guy who did it sure the old man thought that the kid in the back of the police car had to be guilty never mind that he looked nothing like the real killer and was dressed completely differently he must have shrunk reversed his age by 5 10 years and changed clothes the police made absolutely no effort and they admitted it the did no forensics on any of the evidence they questioned no other witnesses and they beat a confession out of a 15 year old the saddest thing about this compelling look at the criminal justice system is that it occurred right down the road in jacksonville florida let everyone now start talking about southern justice,1
16091,mom has to be one of the all time uncomfortable movies to watch it features an elderly lady you would love to have as your nanny who becomes the nastiest mother f ing monster you would ever want to meet on a dark night this supper nanny eats the inners of a young lady at the opening of the movie and it just gets sicker as it goes on a cross between the howling and brain dead seem to come to mind when describing mom a must for horror fans who have the stomach for it if you have watched re animator or brain dead this will float your boat and are willing to switch the brain off for an hour or so let the gore pour 8 10,1
5073,not only is the great rock n roll swindle thoroughly inaccurate but when it comes down to it not much about it is interesting or even entertaining malcolm mclaren apparently squandered the majority of the sex pistols earnings on this waste of film which makes it that much more obnoxious the intention from the beginning was to create a monument to the genius of mclaren who to this day takes full credit for creating punk music creating the sex pistols and at times even writing all the songs viewers follow mclaren to various settings where he tells his story to his sidekick a female dwarf and simply takes credit for one thing after another one particularly irritating scene has mclaren in an abandoned airplane hangar waiting for a plane being hounded by reporters and giving them their big story the most entertaining elements of the film are the animated short pieces however even these reek of mclaren s overbearing self importance even as a farce this film doesn t work little about it is entertaining except for steve jones who is surprisingly decent as a pseudo detective type person 20 years later julien temple who wrote and directed this film also directed the sex pistols documentary the filth and the fury while that movie is much better and more interesting than swindle it still is full of temple s artistic flourishes that just don t work like interviewing band members in shadow as if they are some kind of crime witness trying to hide their identity an interesting bit of trivia film critic roger ebert was one of the original scriptwriters for the movie who killed bambi which eventually became swindle,0
11835,the defining scene to this movie is when the fat guy quits but the evil doctor just gives him one more duty check on the dinosaurs keep in mind that he no longer has this job and so is absolutely not getting paid for this also keep in mind it s a goddamn dinosaur and the doctor he s supposed to trust is evil and doesn t like him but he s still like yeah okay that just defined the stupidity in this movie one melissa brasselle proves that seriously anyone can bolt on some breasts and be in movies i can go ride a mountain bike between them but hey aside from that the people of paraguay are very nice eric roberts gives his absolute worst performance so far there s no adjective to describe how bored he is throughout corbin bernsen saves what there is to save and you start rooting for him but they have to stick to the formula of course and i wonder how much your life sucks when you play like one of the army guys in this one how low can your acting career go the special effects are so embarrassingly bad you expect a sign saying studio 3 to get into the frame it s not even honest pulp it s all taken from carnosaur which even sucked all by itself and then i wonder why just anyone is allowed to make a movie,0
16035,as someone who usually despises ali g ali g indahouse was absolutely brilliant when i was watching it i was in a hysterical fit yes it is sexist rude and extremely crude and i loved it as some comedies are only have one or two comical scenes this movie was laugh a thon i have never seen a comedy as original as ali g indahouse for a comedy starring ali g this would be worthy of an 8 out 10 absolutely brilliant,1
10233,hm where do i start i usually ignore whatever rating imdb has when looking up a movie because i think i might like it anyway or whatever and i should at least give it a chance but this time i wish i d paid attention i know some people liked it and i m not trying to say that they shouldn t it was semi amusing at some parts but if you re like me and you don t like watching cats prancing around in the undergrowth for 20 minutes random fast motion cloud scenes dogs barking in cages for another 20 minutes set to thrilling music and close ups of faces while people are speaking then you might want to avoid this movie the actors were either positively wooden or way over the top and the film quality was awful fuzzy and grainy and bland and not in an artistic way at all and i know that we were supposed to think that carol was not just a crazy maniac with a gun shooting innocent people with this weird religious psychosis going on but well she doesn t really convince me otherwise in fact i ended up really disliking her crazy character and what was up with the souls in space i understand this is a fantasy movie but come on i will say the angel at the end was freaking creepy it was the creepiest thing in the whole movie way more creepy than the darth maul lava face demon i give them props for that scene it was good but not good enough to actually see the movie and the opening credits were great but don t be fooled i would ve rather they used whatever money went into those credits to make the movie better bah i wish i hadn t bought this for even the 2 that i paid for it i could have bought a candy bar instead,0
7043,films like this infuriate me simply because they don t deserve the funding that enables them to end up in my dvd player this movie is ambiguous in its jacket blurb and even more impenetrable in its casting choices why is ms song a romantic interest did they just want an asian woman in there or does her unconvincingly wise character actually lend this message movie s story a fresh perspective one has very little to go on in approaching this film and even less as the story unfolds but a good hour into the proceedings i realized the dull casting is all the casting agent could dredge up the unconvincing character studies are the result of writers brain fart and the story is amorphous and plagued by unsubtle references to the woes of capitalism materialism and getting ahead in the postmodern world towards the end of this film just before i nodded off and missed the last two minutes i got the sense that everything s gone green is a product of connections in the world of film someone with very little talent knew someone with very little directorial skill knew someone with absolutely no marketing sense but plenty of disposable ego and out popped this dull and inefficient attempt at whimsy and humor with a conscience nonsense and this is what is most maddening how many infinitely better scripts were passed over in favor of this almost unwatchable tripe skip this film and feel good about yourself for doing so,0
7408,this film was bad i believe elton or is it mike wong starred in it anyway it was the wong that didn t have that goofy grin and looks meaner he plays a man who is hit over the head and suffers brain damage he recovers and gets revenge gordon liu is the only one worth seeing in this film but he doesn t get to do much but what little he does seems to make theothers pale in comparison also the film has some cheesy rubber hawk that the wong guy controls this film is not worth renting or buying,0
10518,possible spoilers three young people on the wrong side of the law are given a chance to turn their lives around and become useful members of society by becoming undercover cops in the mod squad a resurrection of the hit television series of the 60 s directed by scott silver given their less than stellar backgrounds and because of who they are and the people they know julie barnes claire danes pete cochran giovanni ribisi and lincoln hayes omar epps can go places other cops can t so they are tapped by captain adam greer dennis farina to infiltrate a seedy night spot suspected of being a front for a prostitution ring for a start julie gets a job there as a waitress while pete and linc just hang out to find out what they may julie quickly becomes reacquainted with an old boyfriend billy waites josh brolin who turns out to be involved with drugs which are tied in to the shady dealings going down at the bar before it s over the squad is in it up to their necks while also running afoul of a bunch of wrong cops who are also involved with the drugs and consequently tied in with their investigation from the beginning of the movie there is a sense that you are coming in late as if it s presupposed that you know what s going on as far as the origin and workings of the squad all you get here are brief mug shot bios of the three that give you nothing more than a glimpse into their past there s nothing about how this all actually came about the thinking was probably that by doing it this way it would lead into the story quicker get things moving along while this is true to a certain extent some added background would have made the texture of the story a bit more interesting the way it was done here merely depreciates the credibility of the entire proceedings the plot is marginal to begin with and any time spent on character development would have been well worth the while what s delivered and quite unimaginatively at that is a less than compelling story filled with one dimensional characters the performances are satisfactory but the actors get no help from the script nor apparently from silver danes ribisi and epps come close to fleshing out julie pete and linc but given the time allotted them combined with the lack of support they still fall way short of giving these people life farina a good actor who deserves better than what he gets here comes off as nothing more than a caricature of the good cop there s a feeling that everything was given the once over in this film some detail and nuance would have driven the stock up considerably on this one the supporting cast includes richard jenkins detective mothershed steve harris briggs larry brandenburg eckford lionel mark smith lanier and sam mcmurray tricky it s a shame to see the acting talent involved here wasted like this a lot more thought and planning should have gone into the making of this movie as it is it comes across as ill conceived and poorly executed danes ribisi and epps are like major leaguers who got stuck playing for all the marbles at the local sandlot instead of getting a shot at the title they all got hung out to dry like terry says in on the waterfront you was my brother charlie you shoulda been looking out for me well it s obvious that there was no charlie to look out for them here and after the mod squad they can all just hope for something better to come along the next time i rate this one 1 10,0
2491,it s strange while the film features full x rated sex scenes and violent murders it never feels as shocking as it ought to a group of scientists go to an island in the caribbean to investigate a radioactive incident upon their arrival a mutated islander goes about the happy business of murdering the men and having his way with the women doesn t it always seem to work out that way among the sored acts we find a some lesbian encounters a three way with male prostitutes assorted heterosexual couplings and the rape of an already dead body even though it s all fully explicit it fails to ever shock or stir as it is meant to as soon as the sex goes fully pornographic it just loses it s edge the suspension of disbelief is broken and we realize we are just watching people having sex there is some blood and gore with the murders but given that this is a d amato flick it s really tame for a much more rounded experience watch the similar erotic nights of the living dead 2 10,0
24672,when jean seduces the young gardener for the sole purpose of annoying her husband little does she realise the explosive drama that is to follow the short scenario does not waste a word or a frame in this brief interlude in the day of a dysfunctional family the lives of the father mother and son are all linked in some way with the gardener it s this fact that makes the script so intriguing for such a short film the production is every bit as professional as any major work and the casting is ideal a wonderful little film that can guarantee a few laughs from beginning to end,1
5305,this was painful recently given away as a free dvd with a british newspaper this british belgian co production from 1977 could ve fooled me it looks ten years older than that at least is quite deservedly obscure and if you make it past the half hour mark consider yourself a trouper the combining of animation and live action is ropey at best and downright dreadful at worst which makes you wonder why it was decided to even attempt making the film in this manner when clearly the technology wasn t really there harris is no more than a human prop and the animation is some of the most flat and lifeless i ve seen with the obligatory trippy moments especially where the animation of the brainiac type subtracto character is involved that rendered countless cartoon features from the late sixties onward instantly dated the screenplay by don black provides a convincing argument for the usually resilient lyricist to stick to what he does best and the pace is so slow that even the very young will be bored as for adults stick to jonathan swift s original novel,0

8096,this movie features a pretty decent fx sequence of an earthquake for 1936 the reason you haven t seen it is because audiences in the 30s were enamored of the jeanette macdonald picture in which the eponymous star warbled her way through countless songs while plots came to a complete standstill the fx cross time very well macdonald s songs do not and the awkward insertion of said songs to show off her only typical talent is not good the hoary device of two friends growing up to become a priest and a hoodlum is given another run through the machinery manhattan melodrama the departed at the 30 minute mark you ve already heard the song san francisco three times entertainment in the thirties is generally an accumulation of irritation only grand hotel from the decade foregoes annoyance to the degree shown in san francisco dinner at 8 little caesar stagecoach all quiet on the western front les miserables etc,0
20330,i honestly can t believe that this film isn t more highly rated claude chabrol could be described as something like a french alfred hitchcock and while this film is only the second one of his that i ve seen the first being le boucher i can already see that this guy is something special just on the strength of these two films the film is a french and canadian co production and takes place in canada the cast is made up of british and canadian stars and the high quality performances bode well with the rest of the film most of which is high quality also the film is a murder mystery and begins when a young girl covered in blood is brought into a police station after being questioned by inspector carella it emerges that the young girl patricia and her sister muriel were attacked by a man who killed the sister and only just allowed patricia to flee however as the investigation goes on patricia goes back to the station to give new evidence which reveals a far more shocking identity to the murderer the performances in this film are excellent donald sutherland is subdued as usual but he suits the role he s given here very well and i wouldn t hesitate to name his performance in blood relatives as one of his very best the film also features supporting turns from british stars donald pleasance and david hemmings who both give good turns pleasance in particular who shows just how great an actor he can be and highlights what a shame it is that he went on to waste himself in halloween films the unknown aude landry also gives a great performance in her role as patricia the movie is very mysterious for the first hour and really keeps the audience hooked when inspector carella discovers muriel s diary the film turns into more of a drama in which the girl s last actions are shown and while this section of the film is not as good as what went before it it s still interesting and leads into a great twist at the end overall blood relatives is a great film that really deserves to be better seen le boucher is a better known effort from chabrol but for my money this is at least as good highly recommended viewing,1
23346,absolutely nothing the movies that are great in this world are not recognized unless they are filled with gunshots explosions and death this movie is filled with a man talking about showing you a more complex character than has been seen in many movies when a movie is incredibly fast paced but stays mostly in one location it has to be the work of a genius surprisingly enough it is this movie is directed by oliver stone and therefore is one of the best directed films of our time this movie s screenplay was co written by oliver stone and eric bogosian barry champlain main character with oliver stone s help the screenplay was created as a seamless rolling script which keeps you interested the entire time if you have any amount of intelligence if you have an open mind about any subjects and the wit to comprehend others then this movie is something which you should find some way to watch immediately,1
20428,a minute to pray a second to die is a quality spaghetti western with a solid cast and an interesting storyline it is filmed beautifully with a relatively high production value for a film in this genre alex cord does a terrific job portraying clay mccord an outlaw who is suffering from increasingly debilitating seizures he is seeking amnesty before his enemies close in on him but is being too cocky for his own good when he asks for it robert ryan delivers the best performance in the film as the governor of new mexico mario brega and arthur kennedy are also great here this movie is very good but it doesn t stand out to me as being one of the best spaghetti westerns out there it s lacking too much in style to be in the same league as any of the great ones it does have some cool spaghetti overtones but overall it s a bit too much like an american western this is especially evident in the music score which is ok as movies go in general but pretty dull by euro western standards the soundtrack kind of reminds me of the music from the unforgiven although there is an interesting story here it is told in a manner which is a bit too conventional for my tastes if a spaghetti western fan and a hollywood western fan had to watch a movie together this one would be the perfect compromise all of this is not to say that anyone should avoid this film i did enjoy watching it very much as i said it is a very well done film and i recommend it to anyone who likes westerns spaghetti or otherwise,1
16598,this is the funniest sequel i have seen in a long time it is much funnier than the other three and not a bit scary it has some very gory pieces in the film but not bad enough to make you sick in this one he has a female doll companion hence the name if you liked the first three then you ll love this go watch it,1
22195,man i think people have forgotten how to watch a movie everyone thinks they re a critic they comment on things that the average movie goer doesn t even know or think about i enjoyed the film it was what i was expecting therefore was not disappointed steven gets a bad rap for putting his views into his films but that s also a reason to watch what s even more funny is the people that complain about his films say he s the worst and that we shouldn t watch his films yet watch his movies anyway all so they can comment on how bad they are who s the dummy if you don t like his work don t watch it then you won t have to subject yourself to this supposedly painful event stop comparing movies to other movies and watch a movie on an individual basis and you may begin to enjoy films again,1
4493,where to start with speck the true story of richard speck a killer of eight nurses in the 1960s director keith walley has worked on a few of the extremely low budget full moon releasing movies such as birth rite and here works from a script by at the time full moon regular don adams unfortunaly whilst the film seems like a accurate portrayal of the horrendous crime the script isn t great perhaps because the real speck s ramblings were not terribly interesting despite the care that has been taken to make this authentic it wreaks of a cheap cash in of the acclaimed cinematic serial killer movies of the same period such as ed gein filmed in a dirty brown not quite sepia for the most part and narrated by star doug cole the film fails to present the horror of the crime because the narration is irritating the colouring distracting from the story and the crime though gruesome and upsetting to watch is merely that and no editorial work seems to have occurred on what is pretty much a very poor quality camcorder viewing on the events there is no examination of the motivation or of speck s life really just a cheap shot at a gruesome crime released by full moon there is little evidence of full moon s better output here charles band ignoring his own rule that his films feature fantasy killings e g dolls monsters and so on and not quite knowing what to do with this new reality incidentally band introduced a special label for these films called shadow entertainment band has said that he regrets the period of full moon output alongside tempe entertainment whose creator j r bookwalter and regular danny draven also speak very badly of charles band the tempe era features uniform apple mac editing and brutal hand held camera filming very much like a home movie speck retains these qualities and whereas witchouse 3 for example managed to use these well speck is merely boring and gross,0
1843,some things just won t stay dead they just have to keep coming back for more whether we like it or not i guess some people like to beat a dead horse the first ghoulies was a surprise hit and it s first sequel was an even better film the third film took a more comical approach and by this point the little buggers were starting to overstay their welcome i guess someone out there in hollywood thought it was a bright idea to resurrect the franchise but the outcome will likely disappoint fans of the previous entries pros the acting is actually pretty good for a movie like this a silly but fun score moves at an alright pace some cheese for those who love it some pretty good action packed sequences has a bit more plot than the others and unlike ii iii at least attempts to link itself with the original cons not nearly as much fun as it s predecessors though it has more plot than before it s a pretty ridiculous one poor effects the original ghoulies only appear in flashbacks and here they re replaced with two trolls who serve no purpose other than to be comic reliefs speaking of comedy all attempts at humor are lame is a direct sequel to the first film but there are so many loose ends for example i thought jonathan was done with black magic after what happened in the original not that it was spectacular in the others but this film s direction is especially bland final thoughts the first three ghoulies movies are a bad movie lovers dream this fourth and so far final sequel let s hope is a bit of a letdown sure there s some fun to be had but it just isn t the same the others are low budget too but the people involved put a lot more into them see if you re a completeist or you wanna see beautiful women in skimpy outfits otherwise just stick with the other three my rating 2 5,0
16553,my favorite show of all time yeah i thought this was so cool and larisa oleynik was the first crush i ever had aaaawwwwww it was well written funny except when it it wanted to be serious and just a great show overall but since we couldn t afford to keep nick i couldn t see any episodes after feb 1996 and maybe that makes me think more of the show than i should to me it s more the epidemy now that doesn t look spelled right of having to say goodbye to someone that you love and know you ll never see them again and i still think that because as far as i know there are no plans to release this on dvd any time soon yeah life is mean i ve found that out for sure though you can find an odd episode every here or there but i never liked the bootleg copies of things much either so enough of my sad life most kids in 7th grade don t need powers like alex gets to get them through life unrealistic for sure but then again how many towns have a super evil chemical plants that is willing to do anything for progress at any cost gee this show was fun to watch though i d agree the diaglouge is a bit over developed and even a little politically correct sometimes my favorite parts were when the kids would have some reason to break into the plant a video tape or something like that like a kid s version of tom clancy s rainbow six which years later i got hooked on that game series for probably the same reason almost then you ve got the plant s security team who are trying desperately to find the kid from the accident very mean dudes at least when i first watched the show they seem more sympathetic to me now i feel rather sad for larisa oleynik not sure if she minds this role type casting her but it s what i ll always remember her by oh and btw the actor that plays aaron peirce from 24 is on here too as a school coach or something too cool maybe he can get the producers of that show to get larisa in next season of 24 i only bring it up cuz jack bauer is my other tv hero and i d just love to see cross over things lol both are set in california so i ll just keep on dream n i can see it now let me alone with that suspect for a few minutes no i don t need a car battery,1
14112,visconti s death in venice qualifies as one of the most beautiful films ever made while watching we acknowledge we are in the hands of a visionary genius endlessly opulent death in venice surely is but in other important ways it s an unsatisfying film thomas mann writes with contempt and from a distance of von aschenbach s literary career and output of his imperious manner his layer upon layer of programmed self conscious behavior when tadzio appears and obsession arises it s evident that aschenbach hasn t the slightest idea who he is beneath his gilded age trappings and carefully lived life in fact upon seeing tadzio the solitary as mann sometimes calls him splits in two aschenbach no 1 absorbs the sight of a beautiful 14 year old boy then attempts to intellectually process the giddy jolt in blood pressure as he would a work of art a divine work of art but aschenbach no 2 emerges as a stalker who takes control of then replaces the rational aschenbach no 1 like the original aschenbach his sexual doppelganger is mortified to make human contact with the object of his obsession and thus tadzio remains a far off ideal thomas mann has no mercy for this game every shred of self knowledge comes too strong and too late the excitement of sexual flush is too great to resist that venice is gripped by disease means nothing to aschenbach except that his game now has higher stakes when he finally whispers beneath his breath i love you he knows that all is lost and the abyss awaits is any of this filmable perhaps and visconti creates a visual feast impossible to look away from but there are errors he and dirk bogarde create aschenbach as sympathetic mann again did not aschenbach s pov dominates the film and we are expected to identify but nowhere on screen is there a man being torn apart from within bogarde toggles between the sublimely controlled and the ridiculously temperamental with ease but what s underneath bogard s reactive performance has no mooring mann writes a character who is in his imagination doing the dance of the seven veils all too aware of the consequences such freedom invites yet unable unwilling to resist also visconti s screenplay creates a character not in the original alfred a friend of aschenbach s to dramatize mann s discussion of art and artists these scenes are badly written disasters and the actor who portrays alfred is difficult to watch also visconti s aschenbach is a gilded age teutonic composer which i think works for the film and the symphonies of mahler substitute for aschenbach s novels mahler s great music unfortunately is badly recorded and very badly played so death in venice as visconti hands it to us is not the complete success it might have been but as a purely visual experience its power cannot be denied all students of film especially cinematography will want to take a look,1

20754,i have seen this movie about 4 times and every time i am impressed with the second camera assistant s work seems trivial but there is something very professional knowledgeable and talented there the movie as a whole suffers from other problems as stated by other comments the significance so the issues being approached are as relevant today as it was 40 years ago the acting is a bit strained but the work of the second camera assistant is stellar this person needs to get back into the business perhaps directing what is this person waiting for i will be watching and waiting and cheering from the sidelines bob,1
4380,a man comes to the office of the psychiatric dr sammael joan severance claiming to be the demon asmodeus kane hodder the torturer of the 13th level of the hell and he would like to tell weird things he tells that he had made a deal with lucifer to become human again he should knock up his virgin sister mary elizabeth alison brie on the day that their mother died and she should kill six people and deliver the anti christ and then he would escape from the pit and reborn when mary elizabeth gets pregnant her stressed and abusive sister catherine denise crosby does not believe that she is virgin but their father and former obstetrician albert martino james callahan examines his daughter and sees her intact hymen meanwhile the church discovers the truth about mary elizabeth s pregnancy and sends the priest and former military father anthony eddie velez to spy mary elizabeth she is dominated by the fetus and forced to kill a truck driver lars jorg sirtl who is the lover of her tenant and friend jennifer azalea davila and jennifer herself and eat their hearts and drink their bloods but she believes that she has nightmares however during the ultrasound she realizes that she is carrying a monster and she asks her father to stop her pregnancy but it is too late the awful born is a b movie actually a z movie that believes that is a great movie the result is a pretentious and disappointing production with an incoherent and absurd story without humor and terrible acting and direction the plot is a complete mess there is a priest that is a hit man and former soldier a demon in existential crisis going to a psychiatric a father that examines the virginity of his daughter two female demons succubus that stand naked like a statue with both hands covering their sexes a character that is a slut and only exists to expose her beautiful body there are many scenes with free and cheap nudity but the worst is the acting the unknown lead actress alison brie is histrionic with ridiculous voices and grimaces sorry ms alison brie but i hated your annoying performance i have not recognized joan severance who has a good performance since i still had the image of her youth denise crosby performs a hateful character and like everybody she got older but she is still a good actress i believe that if the writer and the director had included some dark humor and assumed that this movie is a b movie the story might have worked better and better my vote is three title brazil o anti cristo the anti christ,0
7956,ugh this movie has so many unbelievable plot contrivances that they made what could have been a good movie into a hideous mess the story is halfway decent but the holes in the plot make the execution literally laughable we re actually supposed to believe that the secret service would go against all common sense and allow the president of the united states to be put at unbelievable risk if this is an indication of the kind of thinking that passes for good judgment among the president s protectors then we re all in trouble roy scheider turns in a good performance as the president but it is unfortunately offset by the truly loathsome acting of patrick muldoon who somehow continues to get jobs in hollywood based solely upon his good looks and his uncanny knack of smirking at every opportunity regardless of whether the script calls for a smirk perhaps someone will see this and be inspired to make a good movie from the premise or perhaps someone will see it and say hey if they can get a movie this bad made maybe i can too,0
21833,here s what you have to remember about this movie it s a kids movie i don t know about the rest of you but i m an 80s child i was obsessed with rainbow brite so naturally i love this movie but if you watch the other rainbow brite movies this one is by far the best but like i said it s a kids movie you have to judge it as a kids movie it doesn t matter to kids if the acting animation or script is fantastic or even good all they care about is what happens to the characters if the good guy or girl wins then it s a great movie if not then it s bad you all know what i mean you were all kids once,1

19248,due to a very misleading advertising campaign i saw this film in theatres at the relatively young age of 10 the trailers on tv portrayed the film as a comedy and i bugged my parents until they took me after seeing the movie i was blown away i had no idea what to think totally different than anything i had seen before leaving far to many questions for such a young mind needless to say i loved it this morning was the first time i d watched in in probably 2 3 years and i still think it s one of the greatest films made in the last decade kevin spacey and jeff bridges are both in top form as a mysterious man who may or may not be from another planet and the psychiatrist that develops a bond with him while trying to decipher his mystery the supporting cast are near perfect as well each resident of the mental institution is incredibly convincing in their own way the open ending was handled very well giving lots of evidence to support whatever you believe happened in the end how this movie failed to receive at least a nomination in that year s oscars is beyond me if you haven t seen this film run to wal mart right now the dvd is usually in the bargain bin pick it up 9 5 10,1
7570,prior to airport 79 these movies were rather good they had decent special effects all star cast and good acting this movie destroyed the franchise and there are many reasons for it lets talk about the special effects wow they are horrific what was the director thinking about i know it s only 1979 but lets look at other very good special effects movies such as star wars 1977 and moonraker 1979 i like the idea of the concord and this could of been the best airport movie but they did too much with it how about joe patroni george kennedey shooting a flare out of the cockpit window to prevent a heat seeking missile from hitting the concord also he is doing 90 degree dives and loops this completely far fetched and unrealistic wow believe me the special effects don t help this scene and really are beyond poor they almost look like a cartoon and this is how the whole movie is finally lets talk about the acting which in my opinion is extremely poor to fair at best over acting is a major issue in this movie especially george kennedy which i really like as an actor but just doesn t cut in this movie the full blame has to go on the director who did a very poor editing job and really whacked out the airport franchise too bad the concord isn t still used today it was a marvel of air travel,0
24928,the extraordinarily adorable suzy delair plays a statuesque performer obsessed with succeeding in the theater her husband and accompanist played by bernard blier is a composed but jealous man when he finds out in a less than preferable way that his flashy wife has planned a rendezvous with a lecherous old businessman with the intention of advancing her career he loses all control and threatens the businessman with murder now at that point i must stop describing the film to you because it skates on such thin ice with its twists revelations ambiguities and suspense that to imply any of it would endanger it i am not sure how good or bad that is for this french police procedural emanating from the song and dance community though it is certainly interesting that what we do know throughout is who did not do it we just don t know who did the story depends upon the procedure of following clues where ideal alibis fail and where cautiously created fabrications and deceptions disintegrate interestingly this is a suspense film in which suspense is generated in spite of the knowledge one would traditionally think too much too soon quay of the goldsmiths is the least dark of henri georges clouzot s films it s nowhere near as sinister as the shocking les diaboliques as tragic as the riveting wages of fear or as eery as le corbeau maybe it is due to the vibrance of the dance halls and theater settings of 1940s france which all work as the milieu of this crime thriller clouzot both understands and approves of his characters even the more rotten ones where he has more of a vindictive streak with his other films where he may have had understanding for the scheming women in les diabolique or the truck drivers who sink to the level of risking horrible death in order to oust themselves from miserable life in the wages of fear there isn t necessarily support or agreement on the part of the filmmaker for these are characters who plainly made the direct decisions that determine their fate all the characters in this more settling film have scenes and moments that endear us to them even the harsh cold detective played by louis jouvet who worries about his young adoptive son amid all the trouble and despair that happens in his life at any time with the drop of a hat there is humor and unabashed sexiness the latter mostly on the part of delair that neutralize the pressure to a degree clouzot was quietly practicing his craft patient till he made his unrelenting later films in which he would permit his audiences no pardon from the tension,1

4809,other than cop rock and that show where the kid dies from eating a spoiled hamburger he found under the bed this has consistently been the worst and dumbest show to survive prime time if not for jason lee s unjustifiable success in film this show would have never made it out of conception if pitched with a relatively unknown as the lead the concept is terrible moron redneck hick spends his lottery winnings to redeem himself with the white trash of his past is it funny periodically but not consistently is it stupid each and every single episode i ve seen a lot of great shows come then go before their time yet this blunder has survived longer than i ever could have imagined the dialog is incredibly unfunny as are the episode themes every episode for someone with an iq over 100 is an absolute struggle and the icing on the cake jason lee s annoying voice narrating each episode if it weren t for the state s southern culture and rednecks of the south this show wouldn t have an audience if you re a moron and need a show completely lacking humor yet overflowing with bad taste bad dialog and dimwit characters failing at life well then you re probably an actor on this show,0
1276,just saw this at the madison horror film festival and was disappointed a few shocking funny moments fisting the hollow carla a urinating harpy in the dreamland and two competing interesting premises similar to new nightmare with belief bringing a mythical character to life and also lost highway with a man living out a fantasy in his head but had long stretches of no movement and incoherent plot development just because you use the framework of dreams or a mental fugue state doesn t make it lynchian you need the compelling visuals and creepy performances positive things dr maitland had real comic timing and all the girls were very cute carla s father chalmers and ingrid pitt looked like they were having some fun and tom savini at least looked like he had his lines memorized and we couldn t see if he was just reading cue cards i get the hammer references but it looks like the director realized the script was a snoozer and just added some shocks to try and get some laughs out of whatever footage he could put together but they don t work because they re too few and far between and create an inconsistent tone condense this to 30 minutes of all the fun parts and you could have a surreal goofy short but at feature length skip it it s not so bad it s good it s just so bad it s boring,0
21558,now i realize that most people on here trash young warriors or hail it as so bad it s funny type entertainment but let me make something clear it s actually a quality piece of low rent action if you re willing to watch such cinema without a critical eye in fact it s a good deal more entertaining and thought provoking than the bulk of the action films of the 80s the key is in the film s subject matter i m always a sucker for movies that tackle the subject of vigilantism especially when they ambitiously probe into the psyches of the characters involved young warriors may not have the intelligence or sensitivity of the first death wish film and yes i do think the first one had both of those elements but it s trying to be different from the run of the mill cannon films of the period in that it s genuinely unique the plot is simple don t worry there won t be spoilers a group of college student pranksters change their ways when one of their family members is assaulted by a tough street gang the students take to the streets in an effort to combat general street crime being that they don t know who the gang responsible is they eventually acquire some heavy artillery machine guns and grenades and prowl the night fully armed however these are not schwarzenegger types they re vulnerable inexperienced novices who make sizable blunders nearly each time they set out to clean up the city usually with their frat mascot dog in tow they finally figure out who the gang is and go after them but by then you won t be expecting a standard climax in which the good guys walk away unscathed one thing about the film that struck me as strange yet effective is that the bulk of the first act offers no indication that we ll be seeing any action or violence later on as it s treated like a goofy frat comedy you d see on usa s up all night where i believe this was actually shown at one point the comedy set up actually lulled me into forgetting that the vhs cover showed a guy riding a motorcycle with a machine gun strapped to his back then when the violence finally arrives it s not fun or cute at all it s shockingly disturbing from that point on the film becomes a full blooded uncompromising action yarn containing some startling gunfights and gore the acting while nothing special is far more impassioned than i anticipated james van patten who plays the protagonist gives his all and his performance is surprisingly good for this type of movie the rest of the cast is equally invested including the always dependable ernest borgnine as the hero s cop father the cinematography is also above par and the action scenes are handled with a level of severity that i personally wasn t expecting i can understand why some people thought this movie was worthless as much of it is extremely dated but those facets struck me as nothing short of cool in and of themselves van patten s character is studying animation and his patently early 80s style work that s on display in several scenes is a retro film lover s psychedelic wet dream i m sure most contemporary viewers would cite those very moments as low points in the movie but i disagree also joe walsh s soundtrack which sounds like it could have only been recorded in 83 seemed particularly fitting and enjoyable regardless of how old it seems today young warriors is one of my favorite action films of the 80s and i highly urge anyone interested in the genre to take a look sadly however it s only been released on vhs as of this writing and it isn t being shown on tv these days a nice dvd presentation would make me moon walk around my living room with such intensity that i m sure my ankles would swell in the meantime i implore you all to go on ebay or amazon and cough up the ten bucks or whatever for the old big box tape it really is a remarkable staple of ambitious trash cinema,1
14146,if you re into alternate realities contemplating what s real and what s just a fantasy this is an edge of your seat thriller that ll keep you guessing and really make you think try to get a copy of it and see for yourself i watched it at an l a film festival recently and it was by far the best one in the group that i saw it helped that it was actually about something unlike the others that were screened it s very well directed and the production value is top notch i would compare it to jacob s ladder in that it keeps you guessing as to what the true reality is of the world that we re in you should definitely try to hunt this film down and if it s screening at any festivals near you try to check it out,1
18281,there is only one racist joke in this daffy duck short which is basically when daffy rides black beauty it is a black woman i can understand partly why this joke was included as at the time few people did not know how rude it was to be racist and it wasn t even illegal to discriminate black people yet aside from this point a coy decoy is basically a fun interesting short where daffy meets characters in books and does things in books i liked this short quite a lot despite the other reviewers on here the way daffy is so in love with the clockwork duck is vaguely disturbing yet highly amusing at the same time porky is a nice edition to the episode though it was not vital for him to be there the wolf is an example of how people thought of wolves in those days as well blood thirsty terrible animals which of course they never really have been unless they are very hungry i also liked the style of animation used and the theme of the episode for people who are totally into daffy duck and for people who do not mind the occasional racist joke in cartoons enjoy a coy decoy available on youtube,1
17511,i first saw this in the theater in 1969 when i was 9 and immediately fell in love with it i m sad that sony has not seen fit to release this on dvd but one day one day i recently obtained a vhs copy of this on ebay and sat down to watch it 39 years later i m happy to report it still stands the test of time the acting is spot on john williams orchestrations are lush and leslie bricusse s songs memorable when i am older you and i fill the world with love london is london are just a few of the standouts and not enough can be said about peter o toole petula clarke michael redgrave and michael bryant s acting terence rattigan deserves an a for his update of the james hilton story there really is nothing not to like about this film it s a good cheer me up selection glad they have released the original soundtrack as a three cd set with lots of extras wish sony would hurry up and do the same with the film,1
8580,the reason why this movie sucks have these people even read a bible everything in the movie was about moses god was staying out of it that didn t happen god directed everything he told them where to go and what to do also the people wandered for 40 years after they arrived at canan and betrayed god again they didn t wander for 40 years then suddenly find it it was a punishment for their doubts maybe if the people who made the film actually picked up a bible first they would say oh no we got it all wrong try again everything in this movie was about moses they made god look like a jerk who was messing with moses the whole time no no no no no god was their the whole time and he wanted the people to see he was taking care of them how dare they say otherwise not even close to the passage and moses was kept out because he was angry at the people and blatantly disobeyed god he sinned badly and was told he would not be allowed to enter for it when did moses run off and yell at god for everything in the bible never actually read your story before you make up whatever you think is a good idea also this whole god stayed out of it for the most part and made them do it themselves is not true god did everything for the people he provided for them in every way and god told them where to go he was there the whole time the whole we have to do it ourselves is true in some ways but back then thats not how it worked yes today he doesn t work directly for everyone to see but back then he actually killed people after the golden calf thing god worked directly with the people read the bible next time echo bridge or don t make another bible movie,0
9339,possible minor spoilerit s not a terribly objective review but i just found this movie horribly depressing like a lot of russell t davies work it asks more questions than it can answer his best work bob rose doctor who revels in hope against the odds and perseverance even after apparent defeat these uplifting themes seemed strangely absent here i suppose the fact that i m still thinking about it days after viewing is a testament to the quality of the program but the resolution was just too bleak for my tastes i would however disagree with the reviews i ve read complaining that the end feels tacked on i think each conclusion follows logically from its premise and the ending represented a sound personal belief that neatly resolved the primary theme of the show while i never really questioned the progression of events i felt like there was much that could have been expanded upon i ve also read that it was originally conceived as a four part series instead of two and it s possible that the truncation has done some harm to the completed piece however these flaws appear throughout in sequences and themes that sometimes feel rough or sketched in to his credit davies is totally unafraid to write big and you have to admire the sheer audacity and scope of this project the premise he tackles here is the stuff of movies or novels it is a brave and ambitious thing to tackle it in the medium of television strong points include christopher eccleston who is positively mesmeric in the lead for me he was and remains the best reason to watch the depiction of the messiah s humanity was brilliant thought provoking and engaging and a real credit to both davies writing and eccleston s acting i also thought the depiction of the modern world s reaction to the second coming rang true so two stars simply because i personally want my entertainment to be entertaining i would rather be uplifted or at least distracted by my fiction i have a whole big real world around me as filtered through cnn or the newspapers if i choose to be horribly depressed there are definitely less subjective reasons by which to judge this piece but i m afraid my judgment in this matter is clouded by my emotional response,0
13021,this is without doubt one of my favourite horror films ever i really cannot believe that it didn t gain much more popularity when it was released especially when the main contenders at the time were the usual wes craven sequels and copycat horrors mute witness has all the style suspense and quickfire plot twists of a hitchcock depalma movie coupled with some very sharp black comedy and a great plot it never promises to be any more than a good popcorn and hot dog movie but it is difficult not to just enjoy the film for what it is the plot centres on billie hughes a mute girl working on the set of a horror film being made in a russian factory by a series of events she finds herself accidentally locked in and stumbles on the filming of a snuff movie one of the best things about the film is the lack of screaming that seems to invade every horror film ever made as the main character is mute she cannot make a noise something which is a blessing at some stages of the movie and a curse in others the director seems to have studied his hitchcock very well even the opening scene is a tongue in cheek nod to both hitchcock s psycho as well as fairly generic slasher movie scenes while the acting can be hammy at times the whole film does hold it together not only throwing in a couple of excellent scenes that put you right on the edge of your seat but a few neat little questions about how the film is going to end all in all a hugely overlooked well paced and action packed psycho thriller which i would recommend for any jaded viewer looking for something a little different from the usual freddy jason scream michael myers damien regurgitation s at hallowe en,1
5393,i have now seen quite a few films by pedro almod var but this would have to be the most disappointing so far this film seemed to lack the zaniness that is usually everywhere in his films and the story just never got me interested many almod var regulars appear in this film so it s not like there was a lack of on screen talent but this film just seemed more serious than his other films if there was a comedic edge to this movie i certainly couldn t find it and it made for one surprisingly weak movie,0
9521,spoiler alerta clich riddled film that somehow makes an anti death with dignity statement though it attempts to do the opposite washington is a paralyzed forensics officer who has been suffering and wanting to die for the past four years apparently he wrote his huge selling book only a year ago though so it hasn t all be despair he arranges for an assisted suicide with his doctor who will return in a week in the meantime he helps out on a serial killer case he recruits the gutsy i don t wanna do it but i m just so good at it cop jolie and they track down impossible clue jumping to highly unlikely conclusions in matters of moments hey that old bolt means that the killer has the millionaire s wife in a steam tunnel by the old woolworth building shyeah right it s laughable yet no is smart enough to figure out that doctor who s going to assist him is the killer when he comes to washington to murder him ahead of schedule he has a change of heart and struggles unbelievably for his life cut to the obligatory bad guy about to shoot the good guy scene when bang the gun goes off but the bad guy didn t fire no the woman steps out of the corner she has just shot him in the back,0
13247,just saw baby blue marine again after 30 years i still find it a pleasant and romantic film which catches a time which has been lost forever the innocence and purity of a time now long gone is truthfully captured in this small film the acting is above average and richard gere s brief appearance as a shell shocked raider marine war hero holds a keen interest for any film buff or gere fan jan micheal vincent is in his prime and looks and acts like the all american boy the late bruno kirby who was billed as b kirby jr has a meaty role as pop a peace loving marine corp reject dreaming of getting back home to his wife if you re looking for sex drugs or rock and roll this movie is not for you if you re looking for action and adventure the same applies however if you want to recapture a time in america of innocence honor romance and love then baby blue marine is a movie for you,1
18705,the story of tom garner opens with his grand funeral and is told through a series of elegant flashbacks narrated by his faithful lifetime friend henry henry and his wife debate whether tom was a great man and a genius or an utterly worthless scoundrel the film is beautifully written acted and directed and i highly recommend it tom was the fabulously rich and successful owner of a large railroad dominating his board of directors and his competition terrorizing his employees slaughtering strikers tom s ambitious wife sally was responsible for all of tom s success when he met her he was illiterate and entirely content with his work as a trackwalker for the railroad sally teaches him to read and takes over his trackwalker job while tom goes to school he starts to rise one step at a time through the railroad hierarchy until he eventually takes over as president but as tom becomes a business tycoon his marriage to sally gradually falls to pieces his spoiled son despises him and he takes up with a much younger woman the aptly named eve with predictably catastrophic consequences in his business life tom is a total success in his personal life a disastrous failure much like the hearst figure in citizen kane tom symbolizes the best and the worst of the capitalist system spencer tracy is terrific in the role of tom garner and the business scenes ring with authenticity colleen moore is also excellent as sally both of them age beautifully in the multi generational story the film was written by preston sturges but is nothing like the screwball comedies for which sturges became famous,1
4849,i m sorry to say that this movies was one of the biggest disappointments of the year following one of the biggest disappointments in movie monster match up history you would think that they would learn from the mistakes of the previous incarnation the sequel falls into many of the same traps the plot line was completely forced the dialog was so bad that the film might be better on mute and the action was contrived and far from the heart pounding brilliance of each monsters original films the best part of avp requiem is in fact the trailer which as you go through the movie end up realizing that almost every single death and every really cool shot in the movie was already shown in the trailer which leaves little to be revealed and little to be excited about i gave the movie an extra star for letting see the extra hot female in the almost nude the movie played out like a color by number sci fi monster fest which also played into the fact that nothing was a surprise when it happened because you d seen it a thousand times before the main failing with both these movies is that the creators thought that setting the films in our time would make us be interested in the story more as if it may one day happen to us but what drew people in when they released the arcade game back in the day was that it kinda took place within an over the top futuristic version of the alien trilogy time line which allowed more of a suspension of disbelief this is where the future movies need to draw inspiration from because to be honest seeing a waitress killed by the alien we all have feared since childhood just really doesn t do it for us lets take the series back to its roots learn from the former masters and don t mess with a winning formula by trying to make a bold new vision we liked the originals for a reason we want to see that again lastly the ending is the real wtf moment of the whole film spoiler after the big climax the survivors are ambushed by special ops soldiers who justify their horrific actions by saying we were following orders and then turn on a dime and start acting all nice and are turned into saviors then after the long pull back with one of the survivors looking ominously into the heavens we cut to the most bizarre cliffhanger i ve ever seen with characters you never saw in the rest of the movie save the government dude then with all the subtlety of a punch to the face they reveal that there will be yet another film with the hint of a plot line that would make a sci fi channel original movie blush and turn up its nose so in summation if you have to choose between this movie and doing any other activity on the face of the earth skip the movie and do the other thing instead,0
11139,this is a disappointing adaptation of the james lee burke novel in the electric mist of the confederate dead it is rather poorly acted mainly due to the miscasting of the principal players tommy lee jones a normally fine actor just doesn t capture burke s dave robicheaux as robicheaux s main nemesis john goodman does a sloppy job as the heavy the guy who plays robicheaux s actor buddy doesn t look like a former a lister leading man the rest of the movie is mainly cast with no name locals who just don t do justice to a big time novel the movie and jones performance is way too hurried for one thing robicheaux in burke s series of novels gives one the feeling that he fits well into his environment most of the time being laid back and slow moving this is just like the deep south and southern louisiana then at times robicheaux is nearly manic in his exertions jones just moves at a fast pace through the whole movie he doesn t vary ned beatty is wasted mary steenburgen is out of place about the only good thing about this is the setting on the whole the movie gives one the impression of a tv movie,0
14769,i was surprised to like this movie since i m from the check your brain at the door and have fun school of film viewing however this film touched my heart i have friends like mentally retarded emily i have friends like unsocialized evie and i ve been in evie s shoes chasing away opportunity out of fear and out of devotion to others amy madigan s disappointment in her daughters was almost palpable on screen and the awkward moments where she tried to bridge the gap with evie were raw and painful to watch and perhaps i am denser than most but i never saw the twist with evie s father coming usually i cotton on to those things rather quickly my reservations are similar to others posted here i thought christopher lloyd s wonderful sympathetic character a very different role for him i thought was underused what happened to him once he realized what was going on with the poetry would he like james try again second the ending such as it was didn t seem to resolve or accomplish anything i didn t expect the pieces to be picked up and all the ends tied neatly but i felt that i was left at odds with the characters that there was no real healing taking place here or any real efforts at healing being made otherwise exquisite and lyrical and disturbing and for some very very true,1
18774,this show was crap when it first came on the first actress that played the daughter didn t fit the role the writing was hit or miss and damon wayans clearly wasn t comfortable doing such a cornball family friendly show the chemistry between himself and tisha cambell they re long time friends as are all of the wayans clan with tisha s husband and will smith and jada pinkett did work so they retooled the show once it returned they recast the daughter made the son much dumber a la eric from boy meets world and made the youngest daughter into a genius later they gave her a little genius boyfriend to do comedic guest appearances the show while if often rollercoasters from over the top buffoonery to being corny walks the line enough to keep it as a show that you can see damon wayans be comfortable in his own skin on the set especially since the main writers directors and consultants were all members of the wayans family and in his character once everyone had been on the show for a while they worked to everyone in the casts strengths and were able to make a consistently funny show on the air however there is too much buffoonery too many over the top antics and oftentimes too much chaos happening in the life of the kyle family they made junior too stupid they also made the eldest daughter an attractive clumsy idiot from time to time and the youngest daughter wasn t even spared by the writers i feel they jumped the shark and signed the shows death warrant when junior got his girlfriend pregnant she moved in and he married her and her parents were introduced junior s wife s father s character makes me wince just thinking about him the show remained funny but it was a upn show on abc if that makes any sense to the reader the reruns are funny enough but i m relieved it s over there was nowhere left to go with it when it s bad it s really bad it tends to be cornball at times but at least he was a black man who had a sitcom make it to syndication on a major network who can say that for themselves now given the cw merger and the brownout on tv networks lately that is one,1
8311,this story starts at the end so the film s opening credits advise us unfortunately that s not true as we then are treated to around 70 minutes of a typical b science fiction movie of the 1950 s the story is dreary the plot is very weak and has clearly been filmed on a low budget as was often the case in those days the story could have covered any situation where people are taking refuge in an isolated house and being threatened by someone outside it just happened to be adapted to fit round a sci fi story the scenery consisted of a few rocks bushes and smoke oh yes there was a pool of water as well someone wore a rubber mask with a beak like face and what looked like feathers written by lou rusoff who penned several sci fi stories around that time including the she creature and it conquered the world the filming was completed in a matter of days not allowing the actors time to develop their characters to better advantage the low budget restraints also prevented this film reaching its potential it could have been a much better film than it turned out to be mike connors and richard denning brought some life to the film but even they could not lift this film into the category where you could say i enjoyed that film richard denning s acting career began in 1937 he starred with gregory peck and deborah kerr in an affair to remember and later became more well known on television in the series hawaii five o and the flying doctor series directed by roger corman who has many films to his credit both as a director and producer he has made some good films and is still making them he became very well known for his direction of films from the stories of edgar allan poe often starring vincent price he also made other low budget films some were good and entertaining for one reason or another and most were much better than this i would not recommend this film to anyone darnmay 10th september 2007,0
8680,now i like johnny vegas which is a good start i also enjoy toilet humoursuch as young ones and bottom etc this however failed to bring even asmall smile to my face the story follows johnny around after his wifechucks him out how he got his good looking wife and kid i dont know as he attempts to shag anything that moves failing normally i was looking forward to this but found it to be totally boring and a wasteof my time altogether unless you are stuck for something to do for 90 mins apart from wash the car then dont bother,0
24176,i regard this loving and sensitively written story to be one of the screen s true masterpieces after having seen this film originally on the silver screen with my mother in los angeles california when it first came out many years passed before i would have the opportunity to experience it again the beauty quiet simplistic elegance and tranquility of the film to me set it aside from many many others of its kind yes tears still come to my eyes when i see it and hear the refrain of that once in a lifetime song perhaps still today my number one all time most beloved film i would hope this classic love story will be enjoyed and appreciated by our future generations,1
206,the film is annoying technically there are too many times you see unfocused and very roughly edited scenes one could easily get a cleaner film using a decent amateur camera and 100 video editing software down to earth man on the street doesn t mean sloppy editing unfocused scenes that don t contain important statement should have been deleted the same goes for making sure that the object s head hand others stay in the frame my 8 years old son knows that by now the film is way too long the main point anti globalization is understood after 30 minutes why bother with all the rest after the interview with james suckling i pressed the stop button what a waist of time the main theme just doesn t work for me anymore i ve seen too many small wineries which produce mediocre commercialized wines and many big wineries that produce great and unique wines the movie identifies the small producers as the ones that are producing wines with more identity or terroir the bigger ones are accused of producing internationalized or commercialized wines the film is trying to make a black and white statement in a world full of gray tones however the movie hasn t proved this claim they look at a couple of sporadic examples tie some of the big producers frescobaldi with fascism and provided interviews with key people well did all the small producers spent wwii in the resistance is it relevant to see that parker has a thing with bulldogs the movie is very manipulative and unconvincing,0
1060,i saw wicked little things as part of the 8 films to die for horrorfest and this was the only film that disappointed me to wit a mom her little girl and her teenage daughter settle down in an abandoned house in the pennsylvania mountains every night however the vengeful spirits of children killed in a coal mine run about and slaughter anyone they find i guess the director was banking on his viewers being repulsed that children would be capable of pickaxe murders and eating human flesh of which there are lavish close ups as a nice homage to george romero because the film just isn t scary otherwise simply put there are far too many establishing shots of the evil kids jogging to their next murder site if someone s gonna get it in the barn there will be a shot of the kids arriving at the barn oh the suspense and then moving in for the kill come to think of it why do the kids suddenly walk so slowly when they corner their prey and not that i have any experience in this but i think a shotgun blast will throw a child a lot farther than this film implies nor does it help that the mom is one of the worst parents i ve ever seen in any film the lock on the front door is busted you have an eight year old daughter in the woods with bears and mountain lions fix it you moron plus mom and her oldest daughter look waaaay too close together in age even for a teen pregnancy and there s a pretty unbelievable death which involves sneaking up on somebody trying to push a car out of the mud with their butt i m giving this a 3 because it tried as a splatter film it s not bad but for good scares go elsewhere,0
1324,this mess starts off with a real tank running over a car intercut with images of a toy tank this is followed by a family driving home from a birthday party without saying anything the unexplained tank and the untalkative family take up i swear over 10 minutes of film finally the family sees a car after it has been in a wreck and decides to report it to the proper authorities only to find that the citizens of the town are all hiding in their houses and the cops are hiding in the police station interesting almost when the town folk come out due to the family s presence we learn that both the writer and editor are conspiring to substitute suspense with incomprehensible storytelling techniques in the hopes that the audience s inability to tell what s going on will somehow bring unease upon the audience and it works but not in the way they thought it would i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense not in a fun david lynch sort of way but a sort of i walked in during the middle of a boring conversation sort of way over the course of the next hour we learn that the movie makers try to bore us into being afraid by showing tediously mundane scenes combined with the above mentioned what s going on type scenes the plot involves something along the lines of gentle looking old folks putting children into a trance through the power of satan and then bringing them to a party to play with toys and an even more sinister intention and it s up to a group of white men everybody s white in the movie to grab their guns and save the day and a tag a long eye candy woman who whines at the drop of a hat they look for the kidnapped children by looking in random places and yelling the kids names this is a great horror movie for any person who has never seen a horror movie because that person is frightened by the mere thought of satanism paganism wicca or even catholicism due to a lifetime diet of brainwashing from the trinity broadcast network this represents satanism as elderly folks in halloween costumes with candles while mingling at a party in front of an ankh replete with a priest spouting completely made up nonsense about satanists while calling them witches the message that anything that isn t protestantism can be all thrown into the same category for easy condemnation about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words highlights include a guy laughing at the idea of little green men for a solid 3 minutes a family staring out of the windows of their car without talking for 10 minutes while listening to elevator muzak a priest studying satanism for 4 minutes with ooh so scary drawings of demons to scare the church lady crowd random shots of dolls random shots of children paint instead of blood at every chance film school level dream sequences introduces unimportant characters who do nothing before they exit sometimes they act as if the nothing that they re doing is a big deal the directing is sloppy at best an example of the directing includes a scene at the beginning where a man and woman are kissing and the man pulls away to look lovingly into her eyes and some dark red paint falls on her cheek looking up they see that it s not blood but droplets from a girl s snowcone snowcones are ice and colored flavored water and would not have produced droplets of the same texture as paint not to mention the fact that her snowcone was a bright reddish orange hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing it then cuts to an alternate shot of the man woman and girl and shows that she s standing about four feet away from them so the snowcone wouldn t have dripped on the woman even if she d held her snowcone out over the woman s face way to go editor of course the acting is blah the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting the director s most offensive technique is to give the actors no motivation and then go out for lunch as the unblinking eye of the camera leers as the actors make fools of themselves and finally after all that we get to an ending that would ve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell,0
8800,first and foremost i d like to state for the record that it s incredibly dumb to call your movie embryo when the subject matter exclusively revolves on scientific research performed on fetuses animal as well as human aged 12 16 weeks the embryonic stage is over at the end of the eighth pregnancy week and from that moment on the unborn critter enters the fetal phase okay in all honestly i didn t know all this but i took the effort of looking it up and that s the also the least thing the creators of embryo could have done don t worry i m not just stumbling over details or being exaggeratedly bitter as there are several more reasons to state why embryo is a huge failure actual science can be considered as boring and inaccessible and thus science fiction is a cinematic genre created especially to make the otherwise tedious yet educational science topics more interesting and comprehensible to larger audiences by depicting ambitious scientific experiments that go horribly wrong or space missions that encounter evil aliens instead of light years of void filmmakers usually manage to entertain people with spectacular special effects and at the same time teach them useful little trivia about science in order to make a good or at least halfway decent science fiction movie writers and directors only have to comply with one basic rule don t be boring if they can t fulfill this one condition the viewer might as well read a theoretically accurate book something must have gone wrong during the production of ralph nelson s embryo the basic premise is potentially fascinating and even involving as we re all sensitive about saving the lives of unborn babies there also were some very prominent names involved in the production like main stars rock hudson giant seconds diane ladd chinatown alice doesn t live here anymore and director nelson himself was responsible for the acclaimed classics soldier blue and charly then what went wrong simple the script is irredeemably boring clich d and the whole thing looks incredibly foolish because the lab scenery scientific equipment is clearly too primitive to achieve any medical breakthroughs with rock hudson in a very poor performance plays a doctor who hasn t put any passion in his research work ever since his wife passed away when his car hits a pregnant dog on a rainy night his passion returns and he does everything possible to save the dying animals fetuses he manages to keep one fetus alive impressively accelerates its growth process and trains it to become an extremely intelligent dog because his procedure is so successful dr paul holliston convinces his friend at the hospital to repeat his tests with the human fetus taken from the womb of a pregnant teenager who committed suicide the female subject unexpectedly keeps growing at a fast rate however and after only a couple of weeks she s a full grown ravishing and super intelligent woman the good doctor naturally falls in love with her but the groundbreaking new growth treatment also begins to show horrible side effects absolute nothing happens during the first 45 minutes of the film apart from a lot of implausible and overly melodramatic mumbo jumbo and one or two deeply impressive tricks performed by the dog that second half of the film does contain a little bit of grotesque action and suspense but by then the stupidity of the dialogs and the implausible plot twists already ruined the potentially fabulous sci fi idea there are some really cool scenes most notably the chess showdown between victoria and roddy mcdowall in a highly memorable and ultra obnoxious supportive role the grand finale is absurdly grotesque and literally on the verge of ridiculous and it almost feels like ralph nelson put in that final disastrous shot because it was the general rule in contemporary thriller sci fi cinema the last sequence including the horrible freeze frame shot at the end certainly doesn t fit the tone of the previous 100 minutes of the film but anyway my sincere admiration and respect to the dog and his trainers an animal with such intellect and talent surely deserved to demonstrate its tricks in a much better film,0
21588,the worst movie ever hardly this is one of the best animated movies i have ever seen it has appearances from all the great characters from the animated tv series rainbow brite very safe for small children and the colors capture their attention like no other there is an evil princess trying to steal the diamond planet spectra which would in turn cause all life on earth to cease this tells the tale of how rainbow brite and her new friend krys are able to stop the princess evil plot and restore life and color back to earth it s proof that kids can make a difference rainbow brite will live on forever,1
20216,i have watched love jones over thirty times it is one of the rare films that depict a love story about people who happen to be african americans the dialogue was realistically written and delivered with honesty it was so nice to see a film where the story line centered on young professional african americans this is virtually an untapped market love jones was visually captivating as well the chemistry between lorenz tate and nia long will bring memories of past and present love the feeling of the film is jazz and blues and brings to mine the sensuality of a warm creamy hot chocolate with a splash of kahlua and butterscotch if you hadn t guessed i loved it,1
21091,for the most part i only enjoy the kind of movie that allows one to escape the current time into the future or past this movie is pure escapism the dancing starts almost immediately and debra paget in her purple harem bikini dress simply has no equal in film in my opinion her dancing while sultry is surpassed by her dance in fritz lang s tiger of eschnapur available on dvd where she played the temple dancer seetha one problem with the movie is the closed setting there are few outdoor scenes shot and they as well as other scenes are a bit claustrophobic the same locations are used over and over again but with some interesting secret passages and waterways her secret double identity is totally unbelievable with beauty of that magnitude debra even wields a sabre and holds 2 enemy soldiers at bay on a staircase she could do it all what does work is debra paget as a princess with her beauty she certainly would be the center of attention anywhere at any time in history this movie when hopefully it becomes available on dvd will be a must buy overall taken with a bit of humor i loved it,1
21292,traffik is an excellent miniseries dealing with drug trafficking in europe this is the european produced pbs series on which the oscar nominated movie traffic is based on if you loved traffic then traffik is a must see overall i would highly recommend this miniseries to anyone that is interested in seeing drugs from a social point of view the screenplay is exciting and unexpected as it weaves through the lives of drug dealers traffickers farmers policians and police officers unlike other movies that sensationalize the issue of drugs traffik presents it as is,1
10808,i rented this film from blockbust because of the cover and title sounded intriguing this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense the monsters needed more face time we needed them to have some sort of special power and definitely more oh sh moments the photography didn t bother me except for the scene where a re breather blows up there were too many close ups but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn t really work for their freedom overall i would say everyone put in a lot of time even the writers but this movie is definitely a below average rent there are definitely better picks i would recommend anacondas 1 or 2 over this pick,0
10247,yes i admire the independent spirit of it all but it s like road trip with a bad cast and no budget i chuckle when i watch american comedies i don t laugh this movie made me laugh but only because of the abundantly obvious attempts to simulate high budget american high school pot flicks if you want good independent american comedy with pot references go watch kevin smith or richard linklater flicks or something don t waste your time on this piece of sh t movie i mean how can you take these comments seriously when most people are complaining about the characters not smoking pot and by the way in norway it s called dude where s my pot,0
11447,this movie is called solomon kane which it isn t the main character wears a hat but that s all he has in common with robert howard s character solomon kane as known from early pulp magazines and lots of publications ever since these days it is a fantasy movie not really that bad and it might easily have passed with a rather good review if it hadn t been called solomon kane the hero is a newly invented character who definitely is not sk the story is not robert howard neither as a fantasy movie it is one more movie following the traditions of the genre simple story poor cgi poor actors poor directing yet it can be fun you know the cheaper they are the better they are but since it is called solomon kane i cannot accept it imagine a lord of the rings movie with a hero bilbo who fights the black sorcerer saugalf with the help of his dwarf friend aragorn and the beautiful heroine shadowfax and with a final fight where the three use a magical ring to kill the evil sorcerer who has transformed into the dragon gondorian imagine that this is exactly what this movie has done with robert howard s character solomon kane i d give it a 4 stars review if it was just another horror movie but since it is called solomon kane i can only rate it 3 stars,0
9268,barricade finds alice faye without any songs as a refugee trying to flee china and without passport she s in a heap of trouble i won t say what exactly and even american extraterritoriality won t help her out i mention that because one of the grievances that the chinese including the bandits who attack the american mission in this story set deep in the chinese interior was that particular institution whereby american citizens who committed crimes were tried by american courts set up by our consulates we were far from the only country doing that however anyway the story opens with her on a train for shanghai trying to use a hokey russian accent the accent intrigues warner baxter who s pretty plastered bandits however interrupt the journey and the two of them seek refuge in the american consulate presided over by charles winninger he s the best one in the film and i only wish that a better story was given because i liked his character he s a widower and a proud member of the consular service appointed in 1900 by william mckinley he requested a transfer ten years later and that s the last he was heard from as assistant secretary of state jonathan hale aptly put it he s the real forgotten man baxter does all right in a role that someone like clark gable would have done in his sleep at mgm the heroics would have come more natural to gable than to baxter as the mission is barricaded and defended against the bandits alice faye did have one number to sing why alice s song was cut out god and zanuck only know one thing i m still trying to figure out is when the mission inhabitants take final refuge in the cellar with a trap door just who was left upstairs to pull the rug over the cellar door barricade had the potential to be a lot better than it was but sloppy editing and lost faith in the project made 20th century fox release a project unfulfilled watching barricade is like eating a badly cooked meal,0
24225,coming from oz i probably shouldn t say it but i find a lot of the local movies lacking that cohesive flow with a weak storyline this comedy lacks in nothing great story no overacting no melodrama just brilliant comedy as we know oz can do it do yourself a favour and laugh till you drop,1
11704,no gore no blood no gratifying death scenes dumb dumb dumb dumb dear god sitting through this movie made me sick sick sick sick very boring extremely boring theres not even a humorous aspect to this film i cant find a good thing to say about it other than the lead guy had a nice body i guess definitely not worth the fifty cents i paid to rent it,0
19508,although i lived in australia in 1975 i moved overseas not long after fed up with constant industrial unrest the general worship of mediocrity unless one is a sportsman and the complacency of so many australians who chose to ignore the breakneck pace of change taking place in countries to their north consequently i missed the dismissal along with many other australian made tv dramas of the 80s and 90s such as the superb janus and phoenix series which i have since seen along with wildside to me the filmed story of the dismissal is fair and as far as i am aware accurate however as to public outrage it only shows one side of the picture not how families were riven by the controversy i know as my two brothers would not speak to me for months afterward but the commentary is in my view very one sided throughout the inescapable fact is that notwithstanding fiery expressions of rage from a substantial proportion of the community the australian electorate chose and chose decisively in favour of fraser as they did again two years later this apart a historically accurate and superbly well acted docudrama,1
22166,my teacher did this movie it s a new beginning watch it and you won t notice that it is a romanian movie the old boring style has gone now it s something else a post revolutionary movie it is using the latest imaging technology and mostly unknown artists they are unique you won t even know that you re watching you will be simply transferred beyond the screen and you ll feel every frame don t miss it pay attention to the plot but don t ignore the details they make the difference between this movie and the others romanian movies you will hear some music at some point it s representative for a part of us but it does not represent us please just keep your head straight and leave your body free,1
6269,on top of the fact that skylar is a complete douche bag and his cons are unimaginative his schemes require way to much preparation to make any of his scams worth while without giving away any spoilers as if it matters with this piece of crap his cons are such a sham because it takes the effort of days and days of planning and the use of multiple accomplices and an entire camera crew etc just to scam someone into a service that would cost less than a hundred bucks in addition if you read in the credits they re stage some of the phone calls etc because they don t pan out the whole concept of this show is bunk because all of his cons have the cost in both the crew and the effort of ten times the actual cost of the service he is trying to get for free what is the con,0
4014,in spite of its high minded ambitions zurlini s film must be seen as a failure it s one thing to create a world which draws the viewer into feeling the tedium and angst experienced by the protagonist which i think is what zurlini was attempting it s another thing entirely to make a film that is itself tedious and meaninglessly episodic despite beautiful cinematography at a haunting location and a wonderful score the film never lures the audience in too much is unintentionally funny the phony sound of dripping water in drago s quarters for example or the silent movie mugging by some of the actors or simply confusing why exactly does drago want to leave the fort the first time for the film to succeed as a coherent work,0
18123,dee snider was inspired to do a two part song by a horror movie this movie he wrote directed produced and starred in details the subjects from those songs horror terria from twistedsister stay hungry people have commented he must have a sick mind to put something like this out i don t hear anybody making comments like that about stephen king wes craven dean koontz or in his own time alfred hitchcock the movie profiles a modern psychotic created by current trends in society personally i thought it was pretty well done from sheer imagination and inspiration also without the benefit of a large budget and interviews with actual victims criminals this movie is perfect if you want something to give you nightmares and make you cringe about the possible and probable it could happen,1
15557,this second full length lone ranger feature doesn t measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with enough rough and tumble action and moves along at a good clip the ranger looks into a series of mysterious murders which have a sinister pattern to them with peaceful indians being the victims of a gang of hooded killers there are more killings and violence usually associated with lone ranger adventures and the film has an undercurrent of racial insensitivity the comments of which are sprinkled throughout the screenplay the ranger uses disguises as only he can to piece together clues and expose the outlaw band and bring them to justice clayton moore and jay silverheels star in a colorful presentation that shows the desert and cactus country of old tucson to good advantage the music score is good but the familiar william tell overture theme is nudged aside by vocals that are interesting but lack the flourish and beauty of the ranger s traditional theme,1
3812,i love john s work as a singer but the movie was dull and no worth the time to view i thought he did an ok job at acting his part when he says your having an affair with the ol man to his co star i kinda chuckled at his facial movements or lack thereof i would suggest the movie if you like john s music but not as a saturday night video if you love his music then the video has a little music from him in it but not much so so at best,0
17089,one of the best and most inspirational movies about a different culture i ve seen in years tragic and touching worth the watch maybe a few times we all know how brutal children can be i know from my own and my brothers experiences as children and this movie hit the nail on the head perfectly the kite running is amazing and i need to do research on the validity of that event even though it is done in cgi it is still amazing and very interesting to maneuver a kite like that with a single string seems impossible but they make it believable anyway this movie has many twists and turns that are i m sure to many probably easy to figure out but they hit me before i could which makes a great movie for me when you figure out the whole movie in the first 10 minutes it kind of ruins it but this one does it so smoothly that it s hard to guess it even when it happens i m a guy and i don t mind saying that the tears were flowing at more than one point in this movie,1
6777,i understand the draw and appeal to such a different type of movie and i am a huge admirer of movies with little dialog but all the same this one absolutely terrible i ve been to the scottish highlands and found the lack of scottish accents in the characters disappointing this plot was strong enough in theory but the cheap sets and lack of a single realistic character kept this film from getting off the ground i feel the use of silence to create atmosphere only works when you have actors who can exude some sort of presence without speaking and these actors certainly cant if you want a silent movie that captures that presence try le dernier combat there have been very few movies that i couldn t even manage to finish and this was one of them absolute dribble,0
23737,hey this ralf westhoff seems to knows a lot about people we have nine women and nine men taking part in a speed dating event each person has five minutes to talk to each opposite a good idea to make a movie out of these conversations and even better it works very very well the dialog is witty original and authentic each person is subtly characterized without falling into the clich trap something that is unusual for german movies remember all these years we germans were tormented with silly zeitgeist comedies such as workaholic or stadtgespr ch but now the time has come for young german directors to do their own thing and take the risk of producing movies which are entertaining and funny and intelligent and sensitive at the same time the timing of shoppen is good too although it presents mainly dialog it keeps the tension and interest after a while you actually become curious to see how this man and that woman would do some of the participants meet later on for a two some it s fun to see them interacting together in real life of course the film has a few drawbacks it s not very cinematic but can such a movie be the musical soundtrack could have been better but all this is only marginal the most important thing about this movie we have some damn good actors here imagine this all of them are still pretty unknown even here in germany most were derived from the munich or bavarian theater scene but i predict that out of the 18 main actors at least 11 will quickly become very well known in the movie and tv scene over here it s great to see so many fresh and at the same time talented faces well done for those who want to read more here s a rundown of all 18 actors spoilers sebastian weber silent waters are deep memorize his flower garden monologue you can win any woman s heart with this one anna b ger a hell of a woman every time she opens her mouth you can t help but laugh and feel good listen how she pronounces asshole and calls the pink shirt guy a b rscherl felix hellmann the b rscherl from above is fun to watch the inconvenient truth is that there are too many of those guys around his looks somewhat reminded me of flo weber of sportfreunde stiller katharina schubert this woman has everything love hope despair beauty her do you want children scene is a classic a great actress of whom we will hear again no doubt david baalcke now is this guy a loser or not almost as authentic as paul giamatti in sideways i hope this is not method acting julia koschitz the good looking woman in the circle julia used to play theater in my hometown kudos i think she will appear in many tv series to come martin butzke the revolutionary guy catches the cutest and most conventional woman in the end would you like to share a taxi with this guy kathrin von steinburg she gave a stunning performance in tatort last year her trance like performance in this movie is no less see her beautiful face and hear her dirty laugh the best scene in the movie belongs to her matthias bundschuh i know these write down everything guys back from school i m not sure whether the hot blond got her allergic reaction because of him or his cat matthias portrayal of such a chicken is outstanding mediha cetin the sister in law of my ex girl friend was the same talker like her the day i met her was the only day in my life i needed tranquilizers so bad remembrances here thomas limpinsel the nice and desperate guy in the circle limpinsel has a comical talent that is way better than most so called comedians on tv lisa wagner the victim of sebastian s flower garden metaphor lisa s face is funny and full of melancholy her story made me feel good and sad at the same time wow oliver b rgin the good looking man in the circle no wonder he catches julia in the end these two really fit together i think he will appear in many tv series to come julia heinze the cute conventional woman i hope she won t be underrated julia s face changes from naive to hurt to furious are great stephan zinner the nature boy from partenkirchen likes cooking eating and good sex watch the body language between him and the hot blond zinner usually plays csu politician s der on stage anja klawun the bargain girl has some good moments but beg your pardon fails like most actors in playing a drunk on screen christian pfeil plays the arrogant and narcissistic guy couldn t believe that this very actor owns two art house cinemas in munich tanja schleiff plays the girl who sleeps with every man around i m sure many male visitors will go for her i have heard she can do dramatic roles as well so i m curious,1
1571,the sequel that no one asked for to the movie no one wanted there are obviously too many flaws with this movie to name here so i ll just concentrate on the acting miles o keefe would have been better suited to play the spritely asian sidekick thong mainly because he would then have no dialogue lisa foster delivers her lines displaying one emotion dullness charles borremel brings life to his part by pausing every five words and finally the flamboyant john saxon type guy no comment is needed see conan the barbarian if you need to but don t waste your time with this low budget loser,0

1636,by strange coincidence i ve started to watch this move straight after brice de nice and the good thing was that not many movies could be worst than brice de nice so i was really looking forward for something better which would make me forget this horrible flop unfortunately oss 117 again left me disappointed i don t know maybe it s just problem with translations but since diner de cons i haven t seen any french comedy that i would call really good even when i look at the reviews on imdb only people from france are giving the oss 117 high notes for me this movie didn t really work in some parts is as funny as real bond movies in others jokes were a little bit too predictable or too corny,0
14273,the plot line is an expose of the under belly of american politics while the theme seems common what makes the movie is the unconventional way the story is told the characters are played with conviction you feel the innocence of the lead and his innocence lost the politician is the prince of double talk a real snake the camera work is impressive it affirms the nuances of the acting and dialogue ditto for the music the story uses a parable style with vingettes where the message is filled with double entendres a very canny strategy by the writer director the tension in the storyline is carried through to the last scenes the movie was like a good mystery book something was afoot you knew it was bad you didn t know exactly what it could be you had your suspicions and when the evil was revealed you let out your breath you hadn t noticed you were holding in saddened shaking your head a story well written and well told 3 cheers to a young writer director,1
10344,the films use of blue black and vibrant skin tones to create a noir ish feel to this movie unfortunately do not work in fact its quite irritating as it obscures the demon characters and reduces them to one dimensional beings at least the original had an hysterical energy and the gore set pieces were quite stunning black gore is hardly frightening nor is the main female demon at all frightening in her attempts to snarl and growl at the screen in her best camp lugosi style the narrative is grossly disjointed and if you could imagine naked lunch directed by russ meyer you may appreciate the attempt to be william burroughs esque otherwise give this film a wide girth bava and argento fans once again are bitterly disappointed,0
23655,this is a great show despite many negative user reviews the aim of this show is to entertain you by making you laugh two guys compete against each other to get a girl s phone number simple the fun in this show is watching the two males try to accomplish their goal some appear to hate the show for various reasons but i think they misunderstood this as an educational show on how to pick up chicks well it is not it is a comedy show and the whole point of it is to make you laugh not teach you anything if you didn t like the show because it doesn t teach you anything don t watch it if you don t like the whole clubbing thing don t watch it if you don t like socializing don t watch it this show is a comical show if you down by watching others pick up girls well its not making you laugh so don t watch it if you are so disappointed in yourself after watching this show and realizing that you don t have the ability to pick up girls there is no reason to hate the show simply don t watch it,1

16150,as i have said before i am not a fan of tweety he s just so aggravating i wish sylvester would just eat him and get it over with in this cartoon sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage cans he spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he spys tweety is one of the passengers the ship provides an adequate stage for the following hijinks and sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness if only for once he s succeed by chewing and swallowing thus finishing of the irritating canary forever but as cartoons starring tweety go this one is quite good but it s all thanks to that brilliant cat,1

1997,after kenneth opel s rousing story of the invigorated me back into the pleasure of reading during grade school i had high hopes for this series the story of an underdog bat voyaging across country to reunite with his colony captivated my imagination and resonated deeply with my burgeoning imagination upon hearing of this series i began browsing bardel animation s site and liked what i saw the character design looked impressive and the fast paced plot seemed to have been stretched respectably across a thirteen episode arc much was my disappointment then when i decided to watch a rerun early one morn the opening episode shows our hero shade silverwing pursuing a tiger moth in the deep hours of the night chirruping an echolocatory song we see a nifty if crude cgi effect illuminate the moth and the chase takes on a frenetic turn as the tiny insect creates numerous illusory copies of itself do deceive its pursuer as a lover of biology i had a decent understanding of the principles in place tiger moths can sense the sounds their predators use for echolocation and spin a sonic cover for themselves but without such exposition i would have surely been lost a minor quibble i thought surely they director will fill us in momentarily i waited in vain once our protagonist roosts down with some of his fellows we are treated to some of the dullest dialog i ve ever seen on television chinook shade s childhood rival begin taunting the diminutive hero with the stupidest lines i ve ever seen on a show i can understand the writers not producing shakespeare but one would think they d have had some social contact in their lives surely enough to make communication seem natural oh how wrong i was the voice acting while not horrendous hardly was a shining example of human achievement oh shade you re broken the law shade s mother sighs emptily you must come with me young one croaks frieda the wizened elder of the silverwing colony the actors try but it hardly matters at this point as the story becomes less and less compelling with each pass minute while each episode deals with a problem of the week as is typical of with most television series overarching story arcs pervade the saga for better and worse while the main point of the story is shade s reunion with his family later episodes tack on other story arcs involving cannibalistic bats from the southern jungles and a brewing war between birds and beasts the writers try to do too much at once fighting to compress as many promising ideas as possible in the hopes that it will grab audience interest enough to keep the bloody show going on unfortunately these attempts are futile to all but the eight to ten year olds at whom this show is aimed while it s nice to see canadian media be perpetuated it would be all the sweeter if the enjoyability of the series wasn t limited to the immediate family of the animators or frothing fans of kenneth oppel s books there are worse things out there your children could be watching than silverwing but far better programs are out there too pass on the mediocrity and read the books instead,0
14179,directed by jacques tourneur cat people out of the past night of the demon and written by phillip dunne how green was my valley anne of the indies is a quite interesting adventure pirate movie its main character of captain anne providence is based on a real woman pirate anne boney who actually lived and sailed through 18th century s atlantic the film begins with the sea battle where anne s jean peters pirate ship attacks a trade ship that was on its way to europe from the south america as a result a treasure of great value is captured along with a handsome french officer pierre la rochelle louis jourdan who is taken prisoner anne ends up falling in love with him and apparently her feelings are reciprocated but it s only till she sets him free when she discovers that he has a beautiful young wife molly debra paget with whom he pretty much in love with anne begins planning revenge on both of them but in an unexpected twist of fate ends up making a great sacrifice in order to save them instead the pirate movie clich figure of black beard also makes his appearance here this time played by thomas gomez though anne of the indies probably appears to be no more nor less than a revisiting of pirate movie clich s it still has its classical moments in beautiful visuals and sea battle sequences filmed in technicolor as well as in some aspects of the story and most of all in personal touches in directing of all of it by jacques tourneur 7 10,1
21710,the basic premise of flatliners is fairly simple several medical students put themselves at the point of death in order to find out exactly what the brain does during the fact it sounds like something a mob of bored students would do for a joke but it forms the basis of some very creepy substories in today s world where hollywood has to mine foreign markets for the ideas to make a horror film flatliners is one of those rare gems that show hollywood can make something different when it tries hard enough what separates flatliners from a lot of films based on this premise that would come out today is that it does not stoop to being condescending or arrogant flatliners recognises that people go to films to be entertained not moralised to in this kind of supernatural thriller the difference this restraint makes is really incredible what s even more incredible is that julia roberts appears without being annoying or demonstrating that she can only play julia roberts the theory of obscurity that performing artists do their best work with the smallest audience is in force here the subplots concerning what the characters find during their loss of pretty much everything that makes them alive and how it comes back to intrude on their present time are done surprisingly well the moments when william baldwin s character finds his personal videotape collection coming back to haunt him are especially intriguing that william baldwin seems so perfectly cast in the role says a lot either about the script or the direction i am not sure which kiefer sutherland on the other hand really shines as the lead one really feels for him as the mystery of what past experience is intruding on the present and why unfolds as kevin bacon s character goes to find an old school pier whose life he made hell and tell her how sorry he is it becomes clearer what the film is about we can try to change the past as much as we like but it s what we do with the present that matters most another good aspect of flatliners is how it achieves an atmosphere without the use of expensive elaborate visual effects quite unusually for what is essentially a horror film flatliners did not expend its budget in places where it did not need to much of what we see during the more surreal sequences is a case of professional pretending simple trick photography or stock footage sometimes the simplest things are the best if there is a problem with the film it s that it feels about ten minutes too short the ending seems more perfunctory than conclusive as if someone in the studio asked the director to wrap the film up so they can bring it out at a certain market time of course many films have been left with sore spots for this very reason so flatliners shouldn t really need to be any different the hundred and fifteen minutes we do get is highly satisfactory though not overly brilliant i gave flatliners a seven out of ten it works well as a date flick or a kind of late night popcorn film that aside it makes a good reminder that low budget horror shows weren t always sad pieces of garbage,1
7041,i saw bits and pieces of this on tv once and when a friend recommended it i began looking for it even though it seemed no place nearby had it i finally got a hold of it in an antique store and couldn t wait to watch it oh that i had seen it a couple years earlier and could ve really enjoyed it i was surprised that this movie was only 80 or so minutes long and i think this is what made the plot and story so lacking the plot really does sound like a good one both on the trailer and the movie comments a teenager angus jesse bradford and his newfound stray lab yellow are marooned on an island during a storm on a boat trip with his father bruce davison together they manage to survive the wilderness and wait to be found and rescued still what is never mentioned is that everything is shortened and the events of the plot are very rushed there is a possible love interest between angus and sara but they re never shown together for more than a moment yellow is a mischievous dog the parents are reluctant to keep but in a few days he seems to be appreciated enough to join a boat trip the scene of the mother mimi rogers mentioning vaguely what death is like to the younger boy joel palmer doesn t go anywhere in no time we learn that 9 days have been spent on the island then suddenly it s 14 then 19 of all the animals a castaway could be exposed to in the wild only 1 kind a wolf attacks them why couldn t something else have been a problem instead of having the same type of animal maybe even the same one strike twice there are few views of how angus prepares food except when he discovers fruit and roots and when he roasts a trapped rat if he knows so much about survival skills why weren t more scenes with it shown the one thing that made me blank was why the dog didn t have much part alone when he is rescued and the dog is left behind on the island there is no scene showing how he survives without a human s help i wished i was more open to this when watching it but i did enjoy some of this the acting was good and the score was enjoyable though i found myself wondering why the father looked so much older than his family and why he and the main search and rescue conductor share names this is a good movie for kids but though the protagonist is 14 nobody over 10 would be interested with this,0
19901,this is one of the stooges best shorts it was the only one of their shorts to be nominated for an oscar in this short the stooges play doctors who cause some trouble as usual this short has non stop sight gags puns and jokes the part at the end where the stooges are breaking apart the machine this is definitely a classic i would highly recommend this three stooges short,1
15494,a crackling and magnificent thriller about a child psychiatrist catherine deane jennifer lopez who is desperately urged by two fbi agents peter novak vince vaughn and gordon ramsey jake weber to use her therapy on carl stargher vincent d ofornio a serial killer who uses strange and horrifying torture tactics is found in a coma by the feds what novak wants in return from deane is whereabouts of stargher s latest victim is and if she s alive once deane gets into stargher s mind which has the appearence and atmosphere that resembles a colorful combination of david lynch s dune or blue velvet and wes craven s a nightmare on elm street the adventure begins deane sees a variety of odd people ranging from carl as a youngster an adorable jake thomas to a freddy krueger like man minus the razor claws i don t want to give away the ending but the movie is great altogether besides the dynamite performances howard shore s creepy musical score and directing by tarsem who shows here that he can direct,1
13094,wayne wang s direction may be the ingredient which made this film much more impressive to me than slums of beverly hills which covers remarkably similar ground the interplay between susan sarandon and natalie portman is riveting real chemistry there this film succeeded in bringing me inside the dysfunctional life of these two women without dragging me down into depressed frustration susan sarandon s character hammers at all the nerves which a narcissistic parent is capable of touching in an insecure adolescent she amazingly manages to do this without coming across as floridly insane or intentionally sadistic and natalie portman deflects each attack on her character s ego with the resigned grace of an intelligent codependent child untainted by the smug cynicism of the natasha lyonne character in slums of beverly hills portman s character is an adolescent with dignity under stress an unusual creature in modern films the film reaches a very satisfying resolution without trying too hard i highly recommend this film to the viewer who wants to be challenged and entertained,1
20590,the very first time i heard of latter days was when i was renting dvd s and i was interested as i am a member of the lds church i found this movie very heartfelt and in several areas it made me cry the reason for this is that too many years ago i knew a young man who went through what aaron played by steve sandvoss does in latter days but unlike aaron this dear young man did not survive the ordeal he ended up taking is life after his church his friends and his family disowned him because he was gay there have been many people who do not think that the things that are shown in the movie really happen in this day and age but the sorry and sad thing is they do for those of you out their who are gay and young you need to see this movie and if you are a gay mormon you really need to see this movie plus if you get the dvd there is help for you listed in the dvd teenage suicide in the gay world is very disturbing and this movie touches it but that part is hidden to a degree the acting and the music is excellent this movie sold out every movie house that it showed but it only showed in major cities and had a very limited release so for those who would like to see this movie i would recommend the dvd release the only people that i know who did not like the movie are members of my own church and they did not see the movie because of the subject matter gays and the lds church see the movie experience the story and feel the emotions that are showcased in this movie you i feel will not be disappointed,1

7723,i know that this show gave a lot of liberation to women in the late 90s and early 2000s but come on you have a whiner a buzz kill and an over analyzer this show really made women look bad i cannot stand carrie s analyzing every little thing on this show and that s what really killed it for me also charlotte s whining about her nonexistent predicaments made my ears hurt and miranda s cynicism was a complete buzz kill i mean can t she just be happy samantha was the only cool one on the show and the only one worth watching there was also a good episode when nathan lane was on the show but that was the only one worth watching the rest of them were pretty much the same the humor was drier than a bucket of sand and not very interesting plot line all in all not a very good show and i m glad it s over,0
12779,i just re watched this thriller one i had previously believed to be one of hitch s lesser efforts how wrong can you be maybe because i m older or maybe because the film gets better with every viewing but now i think it s amazing every bit of suspense is wrung out of the tiniest detail and that final scene on the merry go round is just breath taking perfect in every way highly recommended,1
15196,i played sam the porter lou s sidekick in the film dead rail which later aired as alien express and i have to say that for my part i thoroughly enjoyed watching this film as a struggling actor this was a chance for me to work with fantastic people it gave me great scenes to include on my reel and it allowed me to work on a dream job for a month and a half no waiting tables turi the director and steve and scott the producers were very kind by giving me this opportunity to participate in the production i made many friends lou todd steven and i consider myself very fortunate to have been able to work with these incredibly talented people there was not a day that went by that i did not laugh my butt off the real tragedy isn t so much the special effects it s that every single person who watched this film didn t get to see what happened behind the scenes and all the talent that truly went into it craftsmen building the set prop masters gaffers wardrobe makeup artists script supervisors the cinematographer production assistants extras craft services producers director and actors it s a given that sci fi didn t spend a terrible amount of money on the film 2 million but there was a lot of time energy and man power that was instilled into it i look on the film now as a production that brought a lot of talented people together for a fun project that was shot without complications in less than two months it was a magnificent cast and crew and i m just so glad to be apart of it on a further note to those of you who don t know lou diamond phillips todd bridges and steven brand they are fantastic people who are incredibly funny lou i still am working on my deniro impression and can t thank you enough for introducing me to midnight run todd every time i hear an elvis song i can t forget the story you told me about hanging out with him at his house for dinner can you please pass me the pa tators im a huge elvis fan steven mr brand you are a true gent and all the advice and encouragement i received from you will always be appreciated i miss you guys and hope you are well thanks for the good memories stories jokes and friendship oh and miss utah says hello wink wink joe,1

21284,contains spoilers i had it recorded a while ago when it was on pbs but never got a chance to watch it probably due to prejudice about having to sit through 5 6 hrs of masterpiece theater with its bbc made for tv production style no music settings all in one room no outdoor scenes flat tv look but after watching the movie traffic which i thought was pretty good at that time i couldn t help digging up the traffik tape to see what else could they have dwelled into with the extra 2 1 2 hr boy was my preconceptions wrong about this tv series it is so much more involving than traffic the characters are fleshed out better so that their actions are more believable and the whole subplot involving pakistan completes the whole point of view of everyone in the whole supply chain from the farmer to the end user in traffic the pakistan story was rewritten and reduced down to a good cop vs bad cop plot there was alot more meaningful discussion and debate about alcohol and other forms of drug whereas in traffic they mostly became passing references of no significance same with social issues which in traffik were conveyed realistically w o sounding preachy whereas in traffic the characters jus t blurted it out as a statement like the way they do it in those made for tv issue of the week movies there was no bad guy vs good guy in traffik even the dealer is portrayed as a junkie that sells to support his habit instead of the nobody messes with me type of person in traffic the only down part is that since i watched traffic not much before watching this it was hard not to compare scene by scene and even though the scenes were not the same i knew what the outcome was going to be already thank god for the pakistan story which is different enough that it allowed me to enjoy it completely w o thinking which scene it compares to although i was thrown off thinking the drugs were fused into the ceramic of the statues in which helen brought back to germany as in the storyline of traffic thank god traffik was not that hokey and far fetched,1
17623,a heroic young trail scout leads a large party of pioneers along the big trail to the west with indian attacks natural disasters romantic complications all part of the adventure as sweeping magnificent as its story raoul walsh s the big trail is a wonderful film as entertaining as it was more than seven decades ago with very good acting and excellent production values it lives up to its reputation as the talkies first epic western john wayne pulled from obscurity for his first important movie role looks impossibly young but he immediately impresses with the natural charm masculine authority he brings to the hero s role he quietly dominates the film with the attributes which would someday make him a huge star marguerite churchill is fetching as a lovely southern belle who slowly warms to the duke s attentions dialect comic el brendel is great fun as a swedish immigrant beset with mule mother in law woes his appearance in a scene signals laughs for the viewer looking sounding like a human grizzly bear tyrone power sr vast repulsive makes a wonderful villain slick cardsharp ian keith is a sophisticated bad guy his famous physical similarity to john gilbert is very apparent here silent movie character actor tully marshall is impressive as a wily old mountain man who helps guide the wagon train corpulent russ powell as a friendly fur trapper puts his vocal talent for making nonsense noises to good use sharp eyed movie mavens will spot ward bond as one of the missouri settlers what will surprise many modern viewers is that the big trail was filmed in an early wide screen process called grandeur more than living up to its name the picture looks marvelous with walsh showing a mastery of the new technology he fills the screen every portion of it with action notice during the crowd scenes how everyone is busy doing real work which adds so much to the verisimilitude of these sequences walsh deserves great credit for being one of the first directors to use wide screen in addition the film is blessedly free of the rear projection photography which blights so many older films it should also be stressed that it is only natural that the soundtrack sounds a little primitive talkies were still in their cradle that walsh was able to use a microphone at all with most of the scenes shot out of doors is more kudos for him the big trail was not a box office success in 1930 william haines comedies were the big money makers and the public was looking for fare other than intelligent westerns most of the cast slipped into obscurity including wayne it would not be until 1939 when john ford rescued him in stagecoach that john wayne s legend would begin in earnest and despite its grand sweeping vistas it would be another 25 years before wide screen caught on with hollywood largely as an answer to the economic threat from television,1
8002,this is one of those movies that is so bad it is awesome it has everything an early eighties movie needs flared pants big moustaches chicks with farrah hair and most importantly ninjas i have a few choice moments to recant for you cole s army buddy has a strange monkey like face and always seems to speak without moving his jaw he gets his ass handed to him about every other scene by the thugs wanting his land so he gets drunk through the entire film at one point his farm workers finally return after being run off by the gangster guy s hired goons and frank i think his name is frank is so moved he shouts to the whole group lets have a cock fight and they all gleefully move to the cock fighting area of the farm to begin the festivities this is funny on every level possible whether you take it dirty or literally it still warms my heart another funny thing is sho kosugi s little grunts and over animated ninja style movements i remember this dude from when i was a kid and he used to say he was the world s only real ninja he had ads in martial arts magazines if i remember correctly my friends and i were a little ninja crazy during the time this movie came out and i can recall seeing it in the local theater many times i was wondering as i watched this on starz last night why every sleazy american gangster type always has a stronghold in the phillipines and wears a white steve martin suit as a matter of fact this guy goes way beyond that in requiring all of his thugs to wear white steve martin suits there is a scene where it looks like 20 steve martin impersonators are attacking a 1970 s sears underwear model cole as we wind up for the final battle cole very clumsily breaks into the bad guy s headquarters and is immediately spotted by a secretary who in turn alerts a guard who fires off a round from his pump action shotgun not 30 feet from the bad guys and no one seems to notice or care cole wearing a completely white ninja outfit proceeds to sneakily ascend a staircase then does a flip right into the area where all the bad guys are the second in charge tells him he didn t need to kill everybody as they were expecting him then gives him a ride to the bad guys huge cock fighting arena don t ask me why cock fighting is a huge part of this movie but it is when they arrive cole is still wearing his ninja mask even though everyone involved knows what he looks like without it the final battle is approaching as cole has killed everybody and now sho as i like to call him reveals himself to have kidnapped cole s lady aka frank s wife and they meet in the snazziest cockfighting arena you ever saw sho then very politely i might add releases said lady and the battle is about to start they do their bowing and start circling each other both masked by the way when they join in battle it appears cole becomes someone else intermittently ala finishing the game a funny spoof on completing bruce lee s game of death cole eventually comes out on top kills sho who dies with honor by being decapitated and all is well next we see cole after ruining everyone s life is about to split town again but not before foreshadowing the brutal death of a fat guy with a hook hand and then he inexplicably winks at the camera freeze frame credits done,0
6541,there are many mysteries in life for example why did any of the people other than carrot top agree to appear in this movie why did anyone distribute this movie why did anyone pay money to see it i guess none of these questions will ever be answered but one thing i know for sure this movie is one of the worst ever made with a budget this big it would already be bad but the addition of carrot top s humor makes it even worse the only entertainment one could possibly get from this movie is to burn it smash it or otherwise destroy it in an amusing fashion if you were to rank it against every movie ever made it would be right between problem child and biodome nuff said,0
10535,it s not fair i was really expecting this to be a hilarious entertaining movie i mean i like drake bell from drake and josh and leslie neilson is nothing to be sneezed at since his earliest classics airplane and the naked gun however after seeing superhero movie i m glad i didn t even have to pay for it it just wouldn t have been anywhere near the 9 per ticket more like a dollar and a few pennies because that would sum up for the hour and a few minutes and as disappointing as this film was i m glad the running time was that short if not shorter i just cant believe how incredibly vulgar unnecessary and above all stupid some of the scenes were and above that i ve seen better acting from a wooden dummy without the ventriloquist it s as if craig mazin purposefully wanted to make a film that deserves its 3 7 if not lower and even try to be worse than meet the spartans very disappointing indeed,0
3644,the sound in this movie is a nightmare that is the best i can say for this movie any chance of a good story is lost once this films starts the premise of the film sounds good a playboy who comes to terms with the people around him the plot is predictable and very dull the wet t shirt contest may be the worst scene i ve ever watched and is almost worth watching in a mystery science type of deal the sound is at times hard to hear and the main actor seems to not know how to speak clearly his accent makes him very hard to understand the only bright sport is the acting of penelope ann miller her role is underdeveloped but she plays it well in short do not waste your time,0
14891,i was lucky enough to see this film at a festival last year and had half expected it to get a release the fact that it was shot on a digital camcorder has surely inhibited its success but as i understand it was never the intention of the film maker to make it look like film in the first place it was more about the story the characters and their relationships is that not what films are supposed to be about but it did have a quality in the texture of its visual appearance that suggests may thomas is onto something we should pay attention to for independent film makers and producers alike who have a the talent and lacking the money and drive a lot can be learned from watching this film technically it has everything going for it the use of light music etc by far outweigh that of any other digital feature film i have ever seen and therefore it is worthy of much praise the actors performances are believable to a point if not slightly under played i felt there was much more in there more depth in particular from the male lead john paul clarke but one thing that really does bother me as a film maker myself is the film being in black and white a need to cover up a multitude of sins than if it was colour do we have more to learn in the progression of digital technology or is this the future of wonderful affordable film making,1
17143,sister helen is a superb documentary about a rigid intolerant foul mouthed bitter oblate civilian nun who runs a shelter for drunks and dopers in a very rundown neighborhood in the south bronx all but one of the 21 residents are gutter drunks addicts robert the only middle class representative he had a real job house and even a bmw regrets she died before he could tell her off why robert like six of the residents was on parole he complained that helen wielded a huge stick over him and constantly threatened to turn him in if he didn t cow tow to her in an extras interview he said helen ran the center to compensate for the deaths of the three men in her life her husband and her two boys the husband was an alcoholic who died of a heart attack at 55 one boy died of a heroin overdose and the other was stabbed to death at 15 helen was left with one daughter who she abandoned to run the center the daughter was not pleased she wanted her momwhat s fascinating is how little helen changed outwardly it seems she made a huge sea change but after seeing this riveting and disturbing video a few times once with the directors narrating it became clear that helen substituted 21 male addicts to boss around to replace her three dead males helen admits she ignored her kids and spent every day in bars but her bossiness intolerance and sharp tongue didn t emerge at age 56 living with her must have been extremely difficult even robert says he stayed clean in spite of helen the film opens with helen abusively demeaning a man who wants to live at the shelter supposedly she is showing off her street savvy another time she publicly demeans mel her assistant for not bathing for a year then she waves his filthy pillowcase in the air the film is viscous with helen threatening and demeaning people her signature song is my way her favorite phrase is i m going to be totally honest with you often people who use such phrases turn out o be the opposite the residents are really down and out only robert has any marketable skills beyond pushing a broom they all desperately need a roof over their heads and helen since she runs the place on her own has the power to admit or evict whoever she pleases she has no governing board to answer to and gets no public funding it is her show helen believes in the cookie approach to sobriety she stopped drinking cold turkey and that means everyone else can too she blames substance abuse on the drug or booze and not the underlying issues that drove the men to drink and drug she s no therapist just a landlady who dyes her hair wears a habit and wields complete power over her tenants and stopped drinking helen also lords it over her inmates by demanding urine ureen she calls it tests on requests twice major a very solid and respected long term older resident who she trusted failed his tests helen was furious and evicted him major stood his ground and said the results were wrong because he never did heroin helen didn t yield and failed to consider a mistake could have been made this was especially troubling since she knew major for a long time yet she discounted her relationship with him assumed he was a liar and relied completely on the results major eventually discovered the codeine in his cough syrup showed up as an opiate helen never apologized publicly but supposedly made up with major privately helen also had a very tainted reputation in her old neighborhood she tacitly admitted to robert she once stayed up very late one night to slash someone s tires the person wronged her and certainly deserved to have his her tires slashed she was not a nice woman so eventually she decided the only way to keep the travis name her last name alive since the three male travises died was to start the travis center for some of the residents it was a great deal they complied with helen and in exchange received a cheap safe sober and structured place to live one however said he preferred jail addicts and drunks don t all need to be treated like children helen employed old school techniques which have been discredited however no one was forced to remain at the center and for some it was definitely a positive experience the travis center is not a treatment center it is a residence for alcoholics and dopers who what to straighten out their lives to receive the full sister helen experience see all the extra interviews plus the audio version in which the two directors share their experiences living with sister helen and her guests,1
14901,i m glad they finally released it on dvd i bought the video tape years ago and watch it at least once or twice a year grammer has a wry wit about him that really makes this movie a success its formula is certainly not original but it s very funny nonetheless i am very surprised that it didn t receive higher in the ratings it ranks as one of my all time favorite comedies it s just a fun little flick that makes you feel good and sometimes that s all a movie is meant to be,1
15927,when i was engaged my fiance and i would frequent the adult bookstores he would look for his favorite mags and on occasion a video that caught the eye as much as i enjoyed the one on one with him that the media caused there was never a video that i really enjoyed i had seen only one other movie way back when there was a satellite channel called xxx it dealt with a private eye unraveling a case that actually had a proper plot and was enjoyable all the others were grunting and puffing and blowing and whatnot there s only so many times you can watch a blonde bimbo faking it this movie caught my eye and i migrated to it allowing him to wander the shop he noticed how hard was it not too grins i was actually interested in something lol in the video section and came over buying the slightly used copy for me we took it home and i loved it here was a porno with a plot i wasn t sure it even classified as porno but i use the word loosely the librarian was a character i could identify with alice rejected her boyfriend s advances she was not comfortable with her own sexuality and prudish in her comments bill went away and she continued to check in books the white rabbit ran through the library one book if you notice closely i believe it s been ten years since i saw the movie was by lewis c and alice for that same reason that propels teenagers to run into the woods when a chainsaw wielding maniac is behind them rather than towards populated areas follows it s the best way to get the plot forward alice finds herself in wonderland i barely recall all the details but i do remember clearly the swim in the lake and how she was dried off i liked how they got humpty dumpty up again the mad hatter s size of member being on his hat to wear it proudly and the brother sister team of dum and dee which did disturb me slightly then again they could have been husband wife but i never could tell no matter how many times i watched it the woman on the knight who told alice go away and find your own knight what s a a nice girl like you doing on a knight like this the part that really caught my attention when i watched it about a year or so later was one of the cards 3 of hearts i think who resembled my ex s current wife exactly we couldn t help but tease her about being in the movie the king of hearts was interesting and the queen was even more so due to the openness of the forum i can t go into details just say it was orgy based and we ll leave it at that when we split up i was allowed to take the video he knew i liked it but in the time since it s been lost in borrowing someday i ll find another copy btw if anyone could tell me offlist what scene was cut from the amazon version i d really appreciate it i heartily recommend this movie for the over 18 crowd it was soft sweet and really 70 s but i liked it immensely out of 5 d,1
19105,paha maa is different finnish film but the things which makes it different are copied abroad some techniques of narration are from amores perros jackie brown and elephant scenes are shot from different angles again paha maa is a good movie but it isn t so good that the hype tolds realistic movie no happy end and no commercial admissions some actors did great job sulevi peltola was so good as a vacuum cleaner peddler also jasper p kk nen shows his skills but mikko leppilampi was so lame he is so overrated actor he s handsome and a nice guy but not the best actor of finland but if you like finnish movies paha maa is worth to see,1
8755,i very well remember the bad press this film got because of the producers court order against clayton moore using the name lone ranger or donning his black mask at personal appearances quite apart from any consideration of the film s quality this was the absolute height of nearsighted arrogance and stupidity on the part of the producers and their attorneys and i suspect that the lesson was well learned after this film tanked which was widely perceived as some sort of karma for the jerks responsible for the court order against moore in more recent times it has become the custom when reviving a legendary film or tv project to invite the original star or stars for cameo appearances and rightly so show some respect you idiots and even if they turn up their noses at the prospect which has happened at least the offer was made this is proof positive that film producers studio executives and entertainment attorneys are not quite too stupid and arrogant to be taught by example,0
4973,i think i win the bargain contest for this movie since i got it as part of a martial arts movie classics dvd collection with 50 movies for 20 bucks which means i paid something like 50 cents for the chance to watch the black fist version of a movie that was released as bogard for a basic revenge flick black fist isn t too bad even though it is obviously hampered by a low budget one of my informal rules of thumb for watching a movie is that if the lead actor is better than his production and screenplay the movie automatically gets at least three stars that is certainly the case here lawson has some presence and some charisma and probably deserved a better film career than he got the street fight choreography the ostensible reason for the film really won t to impress anyone who has ever sparred in a martial arts school or even just been punched in a schoolyard fight i only spent about two years learning basic kung fu but even i would never fall for the front stamp kicks arm drags and roundhouse punches on display here but the atmosphere is good dust and blood and shouting crowds and the actors put some feeling into the fight scenes less believable is the plot dawson s character leroy fisk is portrayed as a street smart sharp young man who goes looking for work as a pick up fighter in illegal unsanctioned street matches yet he is surprised and indignant when he has to pay off the cops excuse me but i was raised in small town iowa and even i knew from watching hard times with charles bronson that the cops have to be paid off for this sort of action and that the guys who fight needed the fixers in order to get their matches and that the fixers were worth the money so you have to watch this movie with a sort of willful suspension of your critical faculties in order to accept it as a black brother being repressed movie most of the other non black fighters in the stable get punched in the face for the same deal too yes the movie suffers from a short attention span the director obviously didn t have the budget to film some of the scenes he needed so he had to fill in the gaps with some fairly ludicrous exposition scenes the i wined him i dined him and then i killed him scene just doesn t work along with voice overs and montages that are clumsy and unconvincing this is especially true with the whole romance angle which seems to have been filmed as if it were an afterthought this is a little shoddy when you consider that the death of fisk s wife s death is supposed to fuel his drive for revenge but once the movie switches all the way from young fighter rising through the ranks to the revenge theme it picks up a little steam and plays with a little more conviction i m not sure that the final payoff is worth the buildup roger ebert calls this sort of thing a long drive for a short day at the beach but it does tie things off in a reasonably satisfying way if sylvester stallone had made this film with a real budget and the same cast slicker sets and costumes and himself as the hero people would have hailed it as the next rocky which goes to show you how circumstance and chance can play havoc with would be filmmakers dreams worth seeing once for various decent shots and lines and to watch dabney coleman embarrass himself in a role that is beneath him,0
21643,american war movie fans might be bored out of their skulls by this movie but that boredom is born of ignorance guerrilla suppression operations are always like that sit around and wait get some hookers get drunk at the base wheel and deal with the businessman kick a prisoner around cover up the killing of the street merchant by the green private then boom there goes two fuel trucks and for 10 minutes a small arms battle with one high caliber machine gun then wait for brass to plan a way to knock out their stronghold and then end up killing a few civilians in the process of doing it if reality doesn t work for western viewers there s always top gun or rambo top gun realistic nope the best part of afganskiy izlom s realism was the way all the planes dropped flares like confetti they had to do that because carter and reagan gave the mujahedin so many missiles also the wave of mi 24 s was excellent a better helo attack even than apocalypse now the sight of their missiles dropping and shooting was a scene of impending death from above for whoever they were aimed at it s funny how the soviets were able to make an honest afghanistan movie within a year after their departure but it took the us six years afganskiy izlom is just as real if you apply it to nato s occupation too someone will always pick up the gun and shoot you cause they care more about the land it s a movie westerners should watch unfortunately i don t think anyone has ever made english subtitles i might have to make some,1
1685,even though this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i would recommend this movie for anyone who likes good pyrotechnics its plot was terrible its horror wasn t really that good its sci fi was even worse but its pyrotechnics were excellent mathilda may was extremely beautiful too,0
3596,this is a fair movie good for one off viewing the plot itself is fairly well worked for a picture of this kind which is a pleasent surprise as is the acting which although a little hammy is better than normal for these types of flick the special effects are hilarious a translucent giant and a blatantly polystyrene papier mache hand wobbling unconvincingly on a bit of wire definitely to watch once for kitsch entertainment value 5 10,0
13751,while this movie is not the most entertaining in the world i think it is better than most over all i mean it had it s little laughs and just all around a good feeling it s not too often we get to see two old geezers just having fun with their age and honestly having a good time with the jokes walter and jack had such a great chemistry together as friends brother in laws just watching them romancing these women was fun and you rooted for them all the way because wither we have to admit it or not for their age they still had game d i loved just the whole plot of being able to move on and having fun no matter how old you are i d recommend this movie for a nice laugh if you want one 7 10,1
11990,i am a longtime fan of the original of this movie bella martha mostly martha and everything that makes that movie great and enjoyable to watch is missing from this one i miss the slow pace the build up of characters and their style in small gestures the dominance of lights and moods and moves over dialog i don t think that the story itself is enough martha kate is more secluded and mario nick is not a clown in most of the cases the things that makes one scene great in the original its is not working in its copy here the small alterations take away the tension my opinion is that you should go and see the original it ll worth the inconvenience of subtitles,0
14378,this film is great well written and very entertaining david duchovny shows once again that he is much more than fox mulder and the performances by the old men are funny as can be old married folks like me will appreciate the connection between two hearts,1
2811,last week i watched a royal shakespeare company production of macbeth it was 25 years old filmed w no props except swords no furniture except chairs it was riveting the acting was super all the actors trained brits contrast that performance to this yawn yawn yawn al pacino as shylock was tragic heavy and couldn t quite lose the new yorker accent despite the long pauses between lines the whole thing was soporific even the comic scenes were barely even worth a smile let a lone a belly laugh this is supposed to be funny they tried to make it tragic it was neither just boring i give it four points for costumes scenery and jeremy irons who is good at playing a dull depressed deep voiced guy can he be anything else,0
3890,dennis hopper must ve been really hungry to do this movie atrocious special effects very poor writing cheesy dialogue stupid looking killer bio robots never mind the blatent disregard for science the awkward scene with the 2 young leads taking their clothes off the best part of this movie was the pull start cyber penis on the wacked out cyborg pirate captain 2 out of 10 stars because i m in a generous mood,0
11174,i found this movie to be preachy and unrealistic it tries to be a movie showing kids fighting against the system but it doesn t even present a positive solution i guess i didn t feel really for the kids i totally can understand what their gripes were and i know how poor the state of schools are but i found their solution and the way the outside dealt with it to be a big bunch of phooey if this comes on tv don t waste your time watch short circuit again for the 235th time,0
13368,along with cops the goat is one of keaton s two funniest shorts which makes it one of the best shorts ever made this has an decent plot for a short and it forms a perfect line on which to hang some great gags keaton is mistaken for an escaped convict how the mistake happens is a classic and then must elude the authorities best gags the bread line and t he elevator,1
4465,there is a fantastic song in killjoy 2 that goes on about how clowns are usually really nice and fun but killjoy is a killer i don t recall the song in the first movie but when singer olimpia fernandez sings killjoy yeah killjoy 2 is sounds like the 2 may have been added in for this dire sequel the film is much worse than the first movie and that was really bad this time the cast including the usually excellent debbie rochon have given up trying and director tammi sutton creates no tension and presents merely a dull and steady film full moon pictures produced this during their urban phase none of which was very good but none so bad as here,0
1191,did the writers pay people to come up here and write positive reviews i mean really it s a bit hackneyed and spike isn t that funny he seems more like the serious guy trying too hard to be funny there are so many mediocre gigs in this show like once the opening sketch was talk show apply directly to the forehead over and over and another that featured spike and another dude getting high and it wasn t even funny they didn t even do anything but sit around and laugh over and over ha ha and another that featured spike talking to a korean guy who ate duck and told him that he had a pet duck ha ha i mean really spike just gets funny guests on his show that s why people like this show,0
9504,if this is not heavily featured on every list of what not to watch it should only be because those keeping that particular list are not aware of its existence which as long as that remains so is the acceptable alternative i m not kidding you this is a bad movie joseph meeker returns from the dead with various vague undefined supernatural powers the most employed of which would seem to be appearing in new increasingly comical looking and ridiculous and never scary or creepy in general when this goes for the latter of those it winds up just being bizarre and attempts at the former just don t work period outfits and stereotypes archetypes and he is portrayed by david keith whom i respect in well at least daredevil doing a more often than not terribly inconsistent which could also have to do with script and often over the top performance a character or two have personalities so unbelievably irritating that they re painful to watch the editing thinks it s considerably more clever than it really is and what on earth was with the red tint for the flashbacks cinematography oh dear framing coverage effective use of angle that one could be attributed some to editing too perhaps please guys stop me when i say something you ve ever heard about the existence of as far as the technical side goes this is a pretty lousy excuse for something more worthwhile to put in the projector than unexposed film but why stop there the plot is just poor the basic idea s been done and it s been done so much better than this the crow would be one the way it s told is gimmicky and while there is some explanation behind the flashbacks it still doesn t satisfy pacing is about non existent the lead is distinctly unlikeable and there s more personality in a barn door not to mention that those are also considerably less wooden kelly perine and thomas ian nicholas what in the name of all that is good and just pun intended are you doing in this perine you were already funny before this on the drew carey show nicholas well i haven t seen you in anything preceding american pie but if nothing else you were funny later on and in those productions the amusement was intentional dialog is the less said the better language is unrestrained and tends to be stupid the violence is shoddily done and they don t even seem to care to try to hide it hinting at it might have been the smarter strategy characters don t get me started why spend so much energy on portraying unexciting at times utterly illogical events the more you think about this the worse it gets it s not even passable as a bad horror flick or a b movie it may very well pass through the rest of the alphabet and go further still it couldn t scare you on the scariest day of your life if it had an electrified scaring machine i recommend this only to people who want to disprove how bad this is and don t say i didn t warn ya 1 10,0
13232,beware my lovely originated from a play written by mel dinelli who apparently liked writing about frightened women his first and best effort was the screenplay for the spiral staircase he also did a loretta young suspense thriller cause for alarm a couple of years earlier the play dinelli wrote was originally entitled the man and it ran for 92 performances on broadway during the 1950 season it was dinelli s only effort on broadway and it starred dorothy gish and richard boone the roles that gish and boone played are taken by ida lupino and robert ryan for whatever reason rko thought to eliminate the age difference dinelli himself rewrote his play for the screen so i m wondering what he thought about that certainly the frailty issue was eliminated completely from the story that wasn t the only thing that was eliminated the people are all wearing period clothing from around world war i yet there s no reference at all to the time this story takes place in i thought that strange and later on when the telephone company repairman comes to ida lupino s residence i noticed his truck was a vintage one of the same era the film is almost entirely set within ida lupino s home where she s hired an itinerant stranger in robert ryan as a handyman the film is a great object lesson in not hiring strangers without reference it turns out that ryan is a schizophrenic who imprisons lupino in her home for about a day both the leads do fine jobs even with the changes made films like beware my lovely are the stuff that a small studio like rko did best if this were done at mgm or paramount the glossy trappings would have overwhelmed a solid story,1
23541,this movie does an excellent job of taking us all the way through the dark tunnel of espionage from the inception through the ultimate reckoning the movie s impact is made even deeper with the realization that it is based on a true story timothy hutton provides us with a quality understated performance and sean penn demonstrates why he is one of america s finest living actors as with midnight express this movie should make us all think twice about doing something we shouldn t be doing in a foreign country,1
17341,having grown up in new jersey and having spent many a day and night on the gritty streets of new york in the 1970 s watching a film like the seven ups or its kindred spirit the french connection always evokes fond memories of a time and place which for some might have been nyc s darkest hour but which for me in my early twenties was always one fun filled adventure after another i truly miss those times as one reviewer remarked this film very aptly captures the stark cold matter of fact feel of the nyc winter season while keenly exposing the underbelly of the region s infamous underworld of crime and policing a great snapshot of a place and a time and a culture a spot on characterization of both the film and the city the stellar attributes of this film the plot the cast the characters and of course the car chase are amply described in many of the reviews here so i won t go into that except to say that one of my favorite moments occurs during the car chase when the camera focuses on richard lynch riding shotgun to the maniacal bill hickman the look of horror on richard lynch s face along with the defensive gestures are so out of character for an actor much better known as a source of terror rather than an object of it that it is actually comical to watch i get a chuckle out of it every time,1
21371,my friend made me sit down and watch this film this is out there material god the devil heaven hell and a restaurant thrown in for good measure four guys and a prick who dies when and how is that s the story you ll never guess the ending for this one a skillfully realized little gem of aussie cinema hats of to the team that made this one 10 out of 10,1
22696,this isn t among my favorite hitchcock films though i must admit it s still pretty good among the things i really liked were the presence of jimmy stewart he always improves even the most mediocre material and the incredibly scary looking assassin who looks like a skeleton with just a thin layer of skin stretched over him although it cost the studio a lot of money i didn t particularly care for doris day in the film she seemed to weep a lot and belts out que sera like a fullback yes i know that she was supposed to sing in that manner but this forever made me hate this song sorry the other complaint though minor i had about the movie was that it was a little too polished and hollywood esque the original version also done by hitchcock just seemed a lot grittier and seedier and this added to the scary ambiance,1
4946,this film is a third rate attempt at a compelling moody thriller and fails miserably on all three counts it just about managed to keep my attention as the protagonist was seen slowly and predictably breaking all the life rules he had conveniently set himself at the beginning of the film but it s in the last 25 minutes or so that things really start to spiral a vaguely plausible plotline and that s being generous becomes completely rediculous as suddenly new characters appear from nowhere and random and bizzarre events are never explained this wouldn t be quite so bad if the scripting wasn t so cheesy the acting so wooden despite a strong british cast and the direction so uninspiring this is not an example of good british film making nor indeed should it make tarantino bat an eyelid at least not in comparison to his earlier work my advice in this case if it s hard to get hold of don t waste the effort if you re a brit like me and it s in your local video shop steer well clear perhaps head to the video entitled american beauty now that s an example of great british direction,0
23219,there are only a handful of movies that were made on such a grand scale and made such a difference in the art of movie making bronenosets potyomkin is one of these movies and it should be on anyone s list looking to learn more about the history of cinema grigori aleksandrov sergei m eisenstein directed this groundbreaking film that documents the horrors taking place on a russian battleship when the sailors finally retaliate against their superiors the locals embrace the them and support them things get ugly when a group of soldiers are sent to the small town to take care of business what follows is one of the most imitated scenes in the history of cinema anyone who has seen the untouchables and bronenosets potyomkin knows exactly what i mean overall i think this movie raised the bar for film making just as intolerance did a few years earlier if you do not mind silent films do yourself a favor and see bronenosets potyomkin if you don t like silent films watch bronenosets potyomkin anyway,1
17539,some films are designed to just entertain you others to make you laugh or cry or uplift others like this aim to provoke to make you think and to make you angry i was angry during this film not at the film but at the fact that it was true that america the free does torture in the illogical view that it is doing it for the greater good the torture scenes in this movie were harrowing the indifference of people was shattering the film was compelling in its argument and showed just how wrong it is to torture people of course now that makes me a bleeding liberal labels shoved on people by others who shut their minds to the facts that this does happen and should not people who don t realise that as the movie said for every person tortured you get ten or one hundred people rise up to perform acts of vengeance you get an ever increasing cycle of violence this film did not make me hate america although i can see how it could do but it made me hate the way that america has reacted in its post 9 11 world there is a significant quote in the film just after we have learned that 19 people have died and seventy five were injured in the bomb scene the quote is one american is dead that makes the difference you cannot kill an american america can kill thousands but you cannot kill a single american or they will do whatever it takes including torture to enact justice this is the american way apparently call me a liberal call me naive although i think the people who think torture is fine are naive call me deluded call me anything you like but this film is a brilliant example of what is wrong in america and the west today i wish this film would be shown to all school students at a minimum this film will stay with me a long time part of me wishes i could forget it because i wish this type of thing never happened but i know it does the other part of me wishes i would never forget because we need to remember these shameful events to prevent them from happening again whatever happens to me this film will be with me for a long time and i will be telling everyone i know to watch it not to be entertained but to be provoked because sometimes we all need to be provoked,1
4976,this is a really mediocre film in the vein of buckaroo banzai the cast runs around like mad max wannabes and they seem to be sharing a joke that they do not want to share with the audience wheeler nicholson is one of the those guilty pleasure actresses you are delighted to stumble across in films but she isn t worth the price of rental space maggot starts an electrical fire and burns a vote of 4,0
23854,i just want to comment to the woman above that the movie does credit beethoven in the begging in the beginning credits they show it thank you i think this is an amazing movie they picked just the right music for the mood of the movie the animation is wonderful and they picked the voices for the characters very well it teaches children to never give up and to always have hope princess annika doesn t give up and it shows children that they can do the same the movie also has humor in in for all ages parents and children to laugh at the colors in this movie are great and kids can really feel good while they are watching it i watched this movie for the first time now i am a huge fan and i m sure your child will be too walmart sells tons of barbie and the magic of pegasus stuff so your child can continue to enjoy the movie even when they aren t watching it thank you,1
9998,eric roberts stars in this tommy lee thomas debut prison film he plays the leader of a corrupt ring of guards though evil by most people s standards his character is the kind of guy who is nice enough to give you supporting wires while you hang chained to the ceiling as he tortures you with lethal weapon electric prods the movie has an intricate plot about prison corruption that makes absolutely no sense thomas has clint eastwood s squinter eyes dolph lundgren s one liners the acting abilities of jcvd and the body of the tiniest guy you knew in school who took steroids after graduation martin cobra kai kove s career shares this low point with roberts in the film it is difficult to tell if kove s character is supposed to be drunk for the entire movie or if kove just came that way i couldn t blame him if he did fortunately for all involved this movie has a so bad that it s good quality that can be fun if you have absolutely nothing better to do,0

20132,women will like this movie better than men of course women like all romantic comedies more than men on average i generally like romantic comedies quite a bit however i considered this a 5 5 for the first 50 of the movie and about a 6 5 for the next 40 and about a 9 for the last 10 so begrudgingly i will rate it a 7 i tape and keep all movies rated a 7 or better and none that are a 6 or worse at least that s my objective i have over 1200 movies so why keep the dogs my wife liked this movie quite a bit more than me though i m not sure why i am a bigger drew barrymore fan than she is the whole point of this movie was about a young woman who goes back to high school undercover to write a story about the high school experience nowadays she was a dork in high school the first time around and has to learn how to be cool the second time around her journey toward cooldom as well as her falling in love with a teacher is the story what drove me nuts for the first half the movie was just how mangy she looked i wondered why they would pick her for this role until i realized how capable she is at looking like a dog so much so that i truly don t think i want to see her in 15 years when she gets up in the morning argh naturally she transformed into a rather attractive cute woman by the end and she became very popular the ending is about a 9 9 on the very sweet scale so you sappers out there will like that otherwise it isn t very memorable and easily missable,1
1528,i am pretty surprised to see that this movie earned even lukewarm reviews i found this movie downright awful the plot flounders around trying to decide if it is a comedy or a thriller then realizes it cannot achieve either so it throws in the towel and continues with its absurd plot highlighted with a unintentional hilarious scene with laura linney an injection and spilled coffee that leaves the audience awkwardly squirming in their seats looking at one another like is this for real basically it is abysmal and really disappointing for robin williams fans and it makes you think someone blackmailed laura linney into adding this piece of trash to her otherwise respectable resume i wanted to leave after 10 minutes and wish i had even seeing it for free i wanted someone to pay me for my wasted time the computer glitch twist in this movie was embarrassingly stupid and by the end you don t care who wins the election i vote for straight to dvd,0
15712,i watched the first few moments on tcm a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes i saw it listed on the schedule at the stanford theatre in palo alto and i vowed i would make the 40 minute drive the stanford is an old fashioned movie house that starts each movie with the curtains still shut yes they have curtains they opened as the fox logo fanfare began to play when the best of everything appeared in huge pink letters spread against the new york city skyline i knew i was right for waiting i lapped this movie up there were so many little moments that added to the look and feel of the movie when hope lange walks into the publishing office for the first time the titles of the magazines published there are etched on the glass the teenager and elegance joan crawford s swanky apron that she wore so she could serve her guests at her party without mussing her outfit the way the camera tilted to indicate how crazy suzy parker was becoming it was almost sideways at one point how hope lange kept living at that dumpy flat she shared with the others even though she obviously was making a lot more money than at the beginning of the film guess it was too scandalous for a single gal to live alone hope lange was so beautiful so was suzy parker and how about mark goddard in a non speaking role i fell in love with him when i was a kid watching lost in space seeing this gem on the big screen prompted me to plan another trek down to the stanford to see the old dark house incidentally i bought a small soda and popcorn at the concession stand and i was taken aback when the worker asked me for two bucks,1
20112,i think this movie more than any other shows what a great actress drew barrymore is because she plays a ugly duckling in high school which is something i never imagined her being a great flick with lots of laughs i don t usually go for those feel good movies but i really enjoyed this one,1
6738,last night i attended a screening of badland with my cousin we were kind of excited to learn once we got there that the director writer the producer his wife and several cast members were also in attendance and that there would be a discussion and q a after the movie but once the movie was over and the credits started rolling and the film really was not edited well enough and is too long my cousin and i without consulting each other immediately got up and left we found out once we started talking outside that we were both feeling so angry that not only did we not want to stay for the discussion we couldn t even look at the cast and crew who had been standing near the exit and who we walked right by as we left i have figured out that the roots of my anger were planted during the scene in which jerry slices his daughter celina s palm with a big knife so that her blood could be used to leave a fake trail it was unavoidable to connect in my mind the physical pain he inflicted on her body with the emotional pain he inflicted on her spirit by murdering her mother and two brothers in her presence sparing her and taking her with him when he fled i ve sliced my palm before accidentally even a fairly superficial cut is incredibly painful because the palm is so sensitive and it is very slow to heal if you don t keep it immobile because you just keep opening it up trying to go about your life but after a very short time with only a narrow strip of cloth tied clumsily around her palm and one scene with a big band aid it was as if she d never been cut my anger reached its peak i won t spoil this moment for you in celina s final scene i got angry because celina is by far the most sympathetic character in the film the actress portraying her is a good one i was and you can t tell me a good screenwriter wouldn t know this immersed in feeling both her physical and emotional pain and the screenwriter by treating celina s emotional pain so cavalierly and with such disrespect also treated me the audience member cavalierly and with utter disrespect sure the script has moments of tears for celina and some dialogue that tells us she s hurting somewhere somehow but by this time we the audience are feeling so manipulated that we ve shut down the manipulation starts very early on in this movie when jerry s family s dialogue spells out for the audience that jerry had psychiatric problems rule one screenwriters give your audience some credit let them do a good bit of the creative work on their own tell the story don t explain to us everything we re supposed to think and feel we don t like it my cousin also knew she was having trouble with the movie early on dialogue wise when jerry and his wife had little to say to each other besides f this f that f you some couples do indeed find themselves in relationships so bad that the f bomb ends up being every other word out of their mouths but it s like watching comedians who curse a lot some of them are really funny the cursing is ancillary but some of them substitute cursing for humor and this screenwriter to carry the metaphor to its conclusion is no chris rock this husband and wife team bravely chose to tackle an awfully complex story with awfully complex characters but they seem not to have realized that the meaning of a story especially a complex one will vary for each member of the audience successful storytelling requires paying attention to important factual details not working desperately to interpret the meaning of the story for the whole audience i worked with vietnam veterans for five years i ve heard more stories than most and i m always happy to see films released that bring their stories to a broader audience it s important on all kinds of different levels that we hear them but i am less than thrilled that this storyteller decided before the film even began what jerry s story meant and proceeded to spell it out for us with a very heavy hand next time pay more attention to the details,0
2454,abysmal indonesian action film from legendary arizal triumphantly sculpts a template for future cinemax pap like china o brien and do or die with erik estrada while simultaneously burying poor rising action star pat o brien with a hackneyed backyard script and three cans of hair styling gel to perm his impressive 1984 mullet this guy s physical prowess resembles a more femme mark gregory and his next credit would be second fiddle to chris mitchum as tom selick powerful at least the action is mindless and non stop with some daring asian stuntmen risking their lives for what is essentially a poorly constructed movie by teens and or meth addicts with no concept of reality one poor extra gets gorno ly shredded by an electric hedge clipper and many more are killed by getting hit in the head by odd objects such as a motorcycle wheel or cardboard box classic rape scenes are tasteless and priceless and quotable dialog such as i would rather trust a rattlesnake are delivered with such exuberance and fervor from the third rate polizioteschi voice actors random highlight some crazy dude eating live lizards movie also holds the record for most cars driven through walls 2 10,0
21654,this film is a good start for novices that have never watched a silent film and for those who believe that quality cinema started with their generations efforts they are doing a disservice to themselves by not expanding their horizons the silent film is a art form of acting in pantomime that is different from the sound film and the stage it can stands on it s own merits the beloved rogue 1927 united artists is a fictionalized history of the relationship of french poet francois villon and king louis xi through villons prodding king louis will defeat his nemesis duke of burgandy minimize the feudal system and establish the king as head of the state and the beginnings of modern france the cast is exceptional lead by john barrymore yes drew s grandfather for those who only remember him for the decaying actor larry renault in dinner at eight 1933 or the ham in the invisable women 1940 this will be a revelation fit trim with the great profile still in evidence he commands the screen co starring in his first american film is conrad veidt with his cadaverous spider interpretation of louis xi this is a duel of acting titans each not giving the other a inch on a trivia note is character actor and dwarf angelo rossitto in his first film his last mad max beyond thunderdome 1985 there are other character actors who would continue in sound that are easily picked up on united artists spared no expense in this handsome production supervised by william cameron menzies costumes props and sets are well done and not exaggerated like in a douglas fairbanks productions there is a touch of reality here the copy on dvd that we watched from delta entertainment came from a good master though not restored its musical soundtrack was clear and the print only suffered from nuisance black spots dirt and drop outs the only major damage at the end of the last reel from water kino also has a edition which may be of a better quality since they do major restorations on their prints best check with them in our opinion this is a must have particularly if you have no silents in your collection this is a good place to start,1
7079,all the way though i was thinking to myself oh god why at the very beginning i thought right it might be average but the acting and plot on most parts was atrocious every part in it was so predictable even though the first movie seemed to bare a large resemblance to the ring it was a half decent movie but this just seemed to take all the good things about the first and made them terrible some bits made everyone in the audience wet themselves eg the part were geller falls off the building had me in stitches my girlfriend had to keep telling me to quiet down i was kept commenting on what was bound to happen next and more times than less i was right why does going into the house make her come after you it doesn t make sense it was a poor excuse for a lot of killings and no really depth was seen at all you can see everything coming which just left you feeling that there was no point in watching oh shes behind her didn t see that one coming yawns surely these people must have thought to oh i don t know carry a knife round or at least try and fight back instead of being eaten but someone hair at best during the movie i was very mildly scared and i mean mildly i was just crying out for the credits as they rolled i exhaled a short oh thank god if you haven t already don t waste your time and money on this pointless plot less sorry excuse for a sequel,0
11328,it s boring it s slow where are the nasty and brutal murders where is the tension that is supposed to scare us this is like watching sesame street without the funny characters of ernie and bert or grover it s really lame maybe it was the writing maybe the direction maybe the acting maybe the editing maybe the cinematography maybe the special effects maybe the makeup maybe all of the above brought this to something barely able to keep your eyes focused on i wanted to get scared not bored this didn t scare me it didn t even interest me i had more fun watching the time on the microwave instead of watching this film don t bother to buy it and if you see it on television by some freak chance there is no need to tuck the kids asleep,0
3330,making a film for under 1 million might be a triumph for a line producer or an accountant but doesn t do anything for the audience the balance sheet might have been pretty but the viewing experience was poor what will be a triumph for irish cinema is when people realise that production values and the script can t be sacrificed i don t understand why people expend the energy it takes to put a film together when the production quality is worse than a low grade tv show the deficiencies of the plot have been mentioned in another review on this site and i totally agree with what was written what i would add is that the film skimmed the surface of several genres without ever settling in one of them the film would have benefited from either going the direction of a straight out comedy or social political commentary my overall impression was that the film was rushed thematically under developed and visually not up to standard on a positive note the performances and music were very good,0
14058,this was truly a tense and dark episode excellently executed wonderful acting and atmospheric directing ice is one of my favorite episodes along with pusher grotesque wetwired and home these are quite good in dark atmosphere in my case it seem quite realistic to me their paranoia their suspicion and their ever growing rage was perfectly executed by the great actors however ice had a problem that i got over after a few watches it was too short i wanted more overall ice had what 98 of all x files episodes have excellent acting intense story writing gritty directing all the works 10 out of 10,1
21375,if you are looking for an erotic masterpiece this isn t it if you re looking for a comedic masterpiece this isn t it if you re looking for something hardcore this isn t it that being said if you are looking for an example of the fine art of european erotic comedy from the the early mid 1970 s this is it i see many people complain about the quality please understand it was made in 1974 yes the women do not conform to the modern ideal of attractiveness they are by no means ugly women but they do not have the same looks which are idealized in our silicone culture yes the dubbing is not great but they are speaking german and anyone who speaks any german will realize it is pretty hard to dub over a word with 12 syllables if you have seen the dvd prior to the latest release it is marketed with 2 covers of 80 s and recently 90 s adult stars the film is an r film so those complaining about hardcore should have realized this the film is edited from the original but it was also edited prior to its run in the drive ins in the late 1970s i first saw this film as a young man and judging by some comments there are many in the same boat who caught a glimpse on cinemax many people become upset when later in life it doesn t live up to their previous memories it s understandable considering the raunch and nudity packed into todays erotica if you compare 2069 to a modern soft core erotic comedy you may be disappointed the film while outlandish is actually quite fluid and the jokes while generally innuendos and double meanings still hold up and can still garner a chuckle if you compare it to a hardcore movie you will be further disappointed compared to today you see very little it is still one of the best examples along with bottoms up and the other cinderella of european erotic comedic cinema of the 1970 s,1
16596,the success of scream gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave i m happy with that as a big fan of horror and i liked most of those new horror films boc is a one big pack of horror colorful fast paced and original i see this movie more like the opening of a new trilogy much like episode 1 and aliens resurrection since it comes up with a new twist instead of focusing on the little boy killer doll relationship we have here a twisted movie about couples we have the sweet young lovers in contrast with the killer crazy doll sized lovers very inventive,1
10755,or that s what the filmmakers would like you to believe anyway this movie tries sooo hard to be cool it s ridiculous everything from the look of the film the cinematography the editing the dialogue and the acting is geared in super cool mode from the get go just to make sure that no one misses how cool this film is there s a soundtrack of really cool rock n roll tunes and a twangy western surf tex mex guitar playing constantly throughout the film as a final reminder of how frickin cool this movie is all the actors have been instructed to speak in a hoarse voice because as we all know that s badass the plot if there indeed is one seems pretty straightforward but as someone else already pointed out the director and star of the film seems fiercely determined not to tell that story instead focusing on a plethora of naked babes and dialogue that s supposed to be badass but grows tired surprisingly quick did they have an contest to see how many times they could cram the words pussy and f ck and its derivatives in an 80 minute film this movie was absolutely horrible,0
9907,i caught this on hbo under its category of guilty pleasures and i would agree that i felt guilty and pleasured watching it one it s trash and really raunchy trash two the plot is slow and predictable and once you learn who did it you think so what however i must admit to being enough of a male chauvinist pig to want to sit through what is obviously a poor movie if for no other reason than to see peta wilson get completely naked a number of times do i feel dirty for having watched it yes am i sorry i watched it no so there s the contradiction between being a lover of good movies and a lover of the female anatomy even when in a poor movie sigh,0
5855,this movie made my face hurt i don t understand it things just happened inexplicably and they usually resulted in someone bursting into a song and dance number i don t understand how people can laud this film with praise there are b movies and then there are b musicals and then there is rockula the songs made me want to run headlong into a wall the only saving grace is that one of the musical explosions turns out to be a musical video which eases the pain yet still fails to justify why it needed to exist the most frightening section of the film is toni basil s creep dance that accompanies her weird song but on the bright side she can manages to find the notes that she is looking for unlike pop music sensations rockula aka rapula and mona wow can we say tone deaf so if you want to question life for about 90 minutes see this film if you hate your life then buy it,0
16870,lucio fulci s don t torture a duckling paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small town sicily plagued by series of brutal murders of young boys this surprisingly well directed film especially in comparison to later fulci s gorefests is distinguished by overall atmosphere of perversity nastiness and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence the soon to be dead children are depicted as casually cruel and budding peeping toms bruno s near seduction by the naked patrizia barbara bouchet really has to be seen to be believed highly recommended especially in pair with my another cult favourite house with the windows that laugh 1976,1
19121,i enjoyed this film very much it effectively combines humor fantasy and a few moments of horror with a solid film making effort from higuchinsky brilliant visuals and a very original story concerning spirals my only complaints are that it had its dull moments and wasn t as daring as it could have been still i give this a solid 8 out of 10 the u s should take note of this and other fine japanese horror fantasy films that have come along recently and have them available on region 1 dvd actually asian cinema in general have some of the finest films that have been unnoticed by the american public because they re hard to find i strongly recommend people to go look for these treasures they re hard to find but once you find them you ll be glad you did,1
10627,there are places for political commentary in film but masters of horror is not one of them i get enough of this stuff from newsweek and every other editorial in the newspaper now i ve got to watch this in horror movies c mon all i wanted was a good zombie schlock film not another bush is bad rant if joe dante wants to express his politics let him go on air america and if you must insist on making a message film be a little more sly about it this had all the insinuation of being slapped in the face with a dead fish by the way joe do you really want the left wing voting block to be associated with brain dead zombies might want to think about that before making another political horror movie god help us,0
13892,having seen other bollywood flicks with salman khan in them i can say this is my favorite of the more recent ones the songs are all quite fun especially o priya o priya which seems to have a nice mix of beatles indian music and dare i say this a bit of prince the love stories are a bit more believable than say chal mere bhai the occasional focus on prem s use of alcohol is at times troubling as it doesn t really seem to make sense to me but it s played well by khan although his voice does become squeaky when he s portraying drunkenness,1
19753,if you ve never been tromatized this is the troma movie to see first amazing acting supercharged soundtrack and bust a gut humor blend perfectly with troma s unique brand of storytelling and special effects despite straying from a word for word retelling of romeo and juliet the fact that it stays in iambic pentameter gives you the odd feeling that it s closer to shakespeare than that overdone music video with dicaprio and danes i assumed i d seen the ultimate shakespearian comedy when the cast of moonlighting overhauled the taming of the shrew but nothing comes close to tromeo and juliet i strongly recommend the dvd version which contains a second audio track with director lloyd kaufman which is just as entertaining as the main track,1
19075,excellent piece of work i am not a surfer nor a skate board fan but work this good about sorting sock drawers would have been riveting a must see there is a lot to enjoy here excellent visuals great sound track mix huge body of documentary work both pictures and film the life work and love of the subject is captivating,1
6709,i have to say that i really liked under siege and hard to kill watching seagal doing his funny martial arts on people i havebeen always looking forward to seagal movies and unfortunately i was first disappointed by glimmer man which i found really bad the foreigner is probably one of the worst seagal has everacted in horribly boring badly edited wrongest soundtrack and so on dear reader do yourself a favor an stay away from this honestly stay away,0
7576,the second woman is about the story of a mysterious man who lost his wife in an accident and now believes that someone wants to do him harm a girl who likes him wants to help him but she is led to believe that his fears are caused by a mental illness interesting plot very good acting but the result as a whole is poor in many ways the story is too simplistic or rather presented in a simplistic way even though there is a couple of interesting plot twists for example people say they love each other after only two meetings i don t want to reveal anything else but you ll see what i mean if you watch the movie come on it was the fifties you may think yet i ve seen quite a few films from that era and i know that some don t seem so dated nowadays something that disturbed me was that some scenes were shot pitch dark making it almost impossible to watch what was going on ok it s a film noir but this one is too noir at some points o overall the second woman is not a masterpiece of that era but no trash either watch it if you have nothing else to do,0
20625,the biggest tragedy surrounding this thoroughly delightful movie is its lack of u s distribution i was fortunate enough to see this film at the boston international festival of women s cinema and highly recommend it to anyone who gets a chance to see it terrific performances and thoughtful script and great direction from the talented and funny rose troche all combine to make this film a winner,1
20349,i was surprised by how emotionally invested i became in this film peter boyle is a tour de force as the working class socially conservative bigot joe i actually sympathized with some of his complaints of course he doesn t mention the underlying historical socio economic reasons for many of his prejudices the film also provides interesting insight into the rapid change american society was undergoing at this time recreational drugs casual sex and the challenging of parental authority became in vogue and replaced the more time honored traditions of respect for god country and seniority susan sarandon fans will be delighted joe is her film debut she also provides viewers with a visual treat near the beginning of the film recommended 8 10,1
20365,a fascinating relic of the turbulent cultural political aura of the late 60s taking in the class struggle as well which ironically in view of its outdated and occasionally embarrassing conservative views makes full use of the permissiveness that prevailed for a while in mainstream cinema and which came about as a direct result of the liberal attitude it purports to criticize norman wexler s incisive oscar nominated script is superbly enacted by peter boyle in a powerhouse performance who manages to make his garrulous down to earth yet hypocritical and opportunistic character with a barely disguised fascist streak which comes to the fore in the remarkable violent conclusion likable even admirable indeed he comes across uncannily like a flabbier version of the young marlon brando similar to other generation gap movies of its era like taking off 1971 and hardcore 1978 but also nihilistic vigilante films like death wish 1974 and taxi driver 1976 interestingly enough two of these also feature boyle joe ultimately emerges as an engrossing and powerful drama which could have been a masterpiece if it had had a more experienced director at the helm,1
6327,gene hackman is a former marine corps colonel who musters a handful of private vietnam vets to go back to laos and rescue some americans who have been listed as missing in action hackman suspects that in actuality the half dozen or so mias are secretly being held in a remote camp by laotians to be tormented and to provide more hard labor hackman is being paid by the wealthy robert stack whose son like hackman s son is thought to be among the mias but the circumstances are such that hackman can only manage to buy old and out dated weapons though he manages to pick up the help of a fervid anti communist loatian and his two daughters along the way i don t think the movie was deliberately concocted to endorse the myth of the vietnames still holding our mias for propaganda purposes the myth was real enough if anyone remembers there were many bumper stickers in 1982 and 1983 bring back the mias i think instead that the film was made partly in order to cash in on the myth it was absurd on the face of it why would our former enemy refuse to return mias propaganda where is the propaganda value in something that s kept secret to add the labor supply they need a hundred extra laborers in vietnam and laos the motives behind this movie with its triumphant music and high body count were scurrilous but how about the movie itself stripped of its theme of rescuing mythical mistreated mias it s a routine paramilitary actioner no better and no worse than dozens of others that appeared in the 1980s gene hackman s performance is the only one that manages to keep its head above water he s just about always reliable of the others this being a formulaic plot derived from the dirty dozen among others i kept trying to guess which of the gang would sacrifice themselves for the mission of the three anti communist asians i figured one or more were dead meat that s why asian helpers appear in movies like this i was right two times out of three i also figured patrick swayzie as the rookie ex officer the youngest of the group who d never earned the respect of the others because he d never seen combat would also have to go in some heroic mode wrong he becomes a hero true but survives intact i thought there was a fifty fifty chance that hackman would have to go too but he makes it out okay the formula doesn t really stretch for originality either charles bronson s claustrophobic pow escapee from the great escape is here in fred ward s ex tunnel rat a claustrophobe who is forced to crawl through a drainage pipe with a snake inside it so that he can do a recon on the laotian pow camp the title uncommon valor is from a tribute that admiral nimitz made to the men on iwo jima uncommon valor was common that day nimitz was certainly right about that whether or not the men who fought in vietnam were all equally valorous is remote from the point anyone who saw combat or even came near it putting their lives on the line for the guys in the line next to them were heroic enough this movie and the way it exploits our bitterness about the vietnam war doesn t really do them justice,0
11229,robert aldrich s brutal quasi black comedy the grissom gang a reworking of the 1948 british film no orchids for miss blandish has 1920s heiress kim darby kidnapped by a pack of clumsy thieves soon that gang is dispatched and poor kim is then transferred into the clutches of another crooked bunch third rate gangster brothers with sweaty pasty faces and a mother who looks like buddy ebsen in drag at first darby not very plucky and not very smart attempts to escape this drooling brood but they re onto her eventually she just gives up trying and therein lies the trouble with the story are we in the audience supposed to sympathize with her is her growing concern for the family half wit supposed to be heartwarming these are disgusting cretinous characters and i wanted to see as little of them as possible but since the side stories the progress of the cops on the case and another one involving floozy singer connie stevens are rather dull the director has no choice but to keep foisting those sweaty faces on us pretty soon nervous darby starts sweating too although her scene up in the hayloft is sensitively performed and aldrich s climactic moments are thought provoking if disorganized from,0
2489,joe d amato might have made some other notable movies in his very long and very prolific career prolific of course by turns of making very cheap z grade movies in italy s big exploitation boom of the late 70s early 70s but porno holocaust isn t one of them or at least shouldn t be granted i should not expect much from a movie with such a title but i thought considering the back of the box s description that it might have some fun horror scenes with the horny mutant cannibal zombie turns out the zombie doesn t appear until more than halfway into the movie and at every turn we get instead a tawdry sex scene as hardcore as one can imagine which is fine but it s not very enjoyable except in the most what the f is this bs kind of way there s laughable dialog involving lobsters costing more from mail order japan than in paris hot slim women play biologists and zoologists who have particular sexual hang ups letting the door be unlocked to be raped and a bi polar kind of enjoyment out of getting gang banged it all leads up to the island where the main attraction is a guy who early on just spends an absolutely pathetic forget ludicrous amount of time just staring at the newcomers to the radioactive wasteland of the shot on caribbean island and once revealed has a face like one of the guards in jabba s palace and has a sweet potato for a main genital but much dumber than anything before it is the relationship that develops between the monster and a dark skinned lady who has an inordinate amount of time to escape but just sits there blank faced as the monster brings gifts and for what must be a racially motivated exploitation move on the part of the filmmakers the monster only rapes and kills the white women and not her and it ends of course with a happy ending i use quotes of course out of a kind of shock that this could have any kind of legitimate ending at all bottom line this is not what you might expect as possibly being a bloody horror movie with plenty of tacky but cool looking italian monster zombies devouring human flesh if anything what violence is in the film is done on a shoe string a log hit to the face is immediately cut to the bloody aftermath which is like the aftermath of a tomato hitting someone so really the last part of the title is meant more for market sake yet even as a porno movie it has little to go on except as a reason for the cast and crew to get a paid vacation to the caribbean as an interview with george eastman suggests this was just one of a few quickies made while on the island its got penny bought schlocky camera work and similar actors filled with genitalia about 3 4 of the whole time and with wretched lip syncing and music like nino rota forced at gun point to make something snappy in a bordello and it s still a piece of celluloid dung all the same all of this could be an immense guilty pleasure but it isn t,0

5530,i watched this out of curiosity i enjoyed stargate sg1 and i ve watched many of the other tv shows and movies that the principal characters have worked on my expectations weren t high so i was surprised to be so monstrously disappointed the acting throughout is appalling and the script is worse zero research into the bad science that is spouted throughout the movie or into martial arts which several cast members engage in throughout the movie despite clearly having no martial arts training baton twirling does not a warrior make training makes the already implausible plot even less credible the same weapon carried by michael shanks when shot at the side of a mountain causes extreme damage but when shot indoors at the wall made of wicker creates a small fireworks effect without damaging the wicker structure ok i suppose michael shanks fans will be sued to seeing that in stargate sg1 where a staff weapon creates either a surface burn on a main character or blasts a hole in a section of castle wall as required but still a bad cgi snake god eats one of the faithful in the way a dog would eat snakes just don t behave like that the basic premise of an amazonian warrior cult on a distant planet is silly at best matriarchal societies have always been based on a lack of understanding that men are required in the process of propagating the species for instance the picts who didn t figure out the role of men in sexual reproduction until the ninth century at which time the balance of power moved from the women to the men they carry technological weapons and demonstrate some knowledge of science particularly of medicine so the idea that a matriarchal society could exist with this level of scientific knowledge is based purely on the original author s wet dream of course the few references to stellar science made in this movie demonstrate that the author knew nothing about that either except for a few keywords that he must have heard in other movies still it could have been done better like she in 1965 for instance which showed matriarchal society with a certain reverence far more believably and even after 45 years it seems fresher than this fetid exercise in stupidity marching a few women around in armour pouting aggressively and spitting out their lines like a kiddie looking for a fight in a nightclub come on then i ll do ya style seems to be over simplifying the complexities of a matriarchal culture the cultural references are so simple all hail the snake mother pretty much sums it all up even the tiniest hamlet shows more cultural variation there is nothing clever thought provoking interesting visually exciting or remotely entertaining about this movie the soundtrack is of similar quality i can only assume that the few overly charitable positive reviews this movie has received are from blinkered michael shanks fans who will give a thumbs up to anything he s involved in don t be fooled low budgets are not a reason for a film to fail cheap b movies can be brilliant this isn t one of them and there s no reason to inflict this movie on yourself,0
5788,i turned this off about 50 minutes into it whoever the moron was who decided to steal the idea of koushun takami s book battle royal make it into a pathetic reality tv show scenario deserves to be shot it has done the film industry a good turn though now directors like william malone fear dot com can say well at least it s better than series 7 this piece of crap dracula 3000 tie for first place in the worst 100 movies ever made be warned this is not a so bad it s good flick this is a disgrace to film makers everywhere never see this movie,0
11332,trite and tiring the one liners almost made me cry my 4 year old left the room and ended up doing a puzzle i don t know what age group this was written for but the writer himself herself didn t even want credit as for the song it s mildly amusing at least it was a decade ago there are many christmas movies to watch although i ve seen some many more times than this they are still enjoyable whenever this comes on i try to encourage my child to watch something else one positive note that allowed a vote of 2 instead of 1 is that it encourages good moral values that would have been encouraging if anyone were watching,0
8901,the quickie tells of a decadent russian mob family who lives in malibu and well frankly this awful attempt at drama isn t worthy of commentary jason leigh introduces herself to mr mob guy as being from pacific exterminators with huge letters in plain sight on her back which say west coast exterminators eventually the mob guys get suspicious because she was exterminating in a bedroom duh in another scene mr mobguy plays russian roulette giving a hooker 4000 to bet whether he ll live or die she has 5 chances out of 6 of keeping the money if she bets live well she bets die double duh later she complains it wasn t fair and wants to play again triple duh the list of flaws just goes on and on while this intelligence insulting film stinks and sinks in a quagmire of lousy music mediocre camera work poor direction boring story etc pass on this loser d note the barebones dvd which i rented had no english same language subtitles or closed captions,0
10916,this film takes a lot of liberties with the known historical facts even little things like flynn licking one stamp after another when he almost certainly would have used a moistened sponge is one of the annoying things flynn was never tried of manslaughter or murder he is not known to have caught his mother making love to another man and is not known to have had an homosexual relationship with anybody and he did not end up on skid row in sydney he did not get his twopenny halfpenny role in in the wake of the bounty by imposture and this role did not turn him into a well dressed film star this is just a mediocre film where the name of errol flynn has been tacked on just to sell more tickets and more videos,0
24019,boogie nights uses its protagonist dirk diggler as a metaphor for accumulated celebrities from a decade in america s shameful past which was comprised of an unexpected rise in pornography therefore resulting in an abundance of corrupted youth its lead character borrows traits from a various assortment of genuine actors involving himself in many illegal affairs that have been dabbled in by celebrities in hollywood and all too often exploited by the press it seems like the sort of tall tale that might appear on an e true hollywood story special drugs sex and violence the american dream but what goes up must come down and the bigger it is the harder it falls dirk diggler s dreams are huge as is another valuable asset on his body dirk s real name is eddie adams a californian who dreams of becoming a star he believes that god gives one great talent to every individual on the planet and his gift is a rather unusual one after falling out with his mother eddie leaves home and meets the sleazy jack horner burt reynolds an adult film director who offers him work eddie eventually becomes a major porn star representing the leading actor in most of horner s films with newfound success eddie is told that he needs to invent a new alias for himself and so dirk diggler is born eddie dirk himself is primarily based on infamous porn star john holmes whose life story was adapted in 2003 with wonderland which starred val kilmer boogie nights is unarguably the better of the two proving that movies about pornography can be made without disgusting its target audience regular cinema goers the film takes place in 1977 an era of artistic pornography filmmakers truly believed that they could compensate for the low points of x rated features by adding deep stories and mesmerizing atmosphere in a way the film s director paul thomas anderson implements a very artistic approach to the project resulting in a gratuitous and artistic movie about a period in american history when smut was indeed both gratuitous and artistic anderson s style is so deep and so distinct that we soon feel as if we are reliving the era first hand not a moment goes by where we are unconvinced of the time range dealt with in the film all was not happy on the set of boogie nights prior to filming anderson approached reynolds repeatedly asking him many separate times to play the role of horner eventually reynolds agreed but claimed that the film was horrible and the worst role of his career publicly disowning it before being nominated for a best supporting actor academy award and suddenly shutting up a year before anderson had suffered title disputes over sydney hard eight he preferred the latter title for his film and new line cinema thought the former was more marketable he essentially lost the battle and anderson wisely avoided title disputes this time around by inserting the words boogie nights into his movie through the mouth of a character the casting of the film is one of its finest aspects the paul thomas anderson regulars are here as well as a whole top notch cast of first timers to name some of the more well known stars john c reilly phillip seymour hoffman luis guzman william h macy heather graham and julianne moore but the entire movie essentially borders down to mark wahlberg as eddie who is surprisingly convincing in his role wahlberg previously known for his singing career and disappointing hollywood pursuits has all the necessary traits to portray such a character this is his best role to date anderson knows how to captivate his audience and take complete control of every scene when jack horner first meets eddie anderson slyly uses stars in the backdrop a sign of things to come and hidden symbolism as finely acute as it can be the opening scene is three minutes a long tracking shot that follows jack and amber into a night club where most of the characters are first introduced it reminds me of the discussions regarding tracking shots in robert altman s the player it works so brilliantly in boogie nights and is the first indication that anderson knows what he is doing behind the camera his style is fast paced in the vein of martin scorsese where shots zip around quite quickly but never seem rushed incidentally anderson references two classic scorsese shots the closing de niro mirror speech from raging bull and the tracking nightclub scene from goodfellas anderson is a young growing director who is remarkably mature in story and direction despite his age whereas his first feature film hard eight was noticeably wise and poignant boogie nights is even more so boogie nights began as an effort of love on paul thomas anderson s account having filmed the extraordinary hard eight in 1996 anderson s film is pragmatic to such an extreme that it almost seems genuine boogie nights invigorates us with its gratuitous content occasionally bordering on the verge of pornography only it is far more sophisticated than such trash it is a blazing wonderful modern day masterpiece that is as mind numbingly explicit as it is wild and stylish arguably anderson s best film and among the greatest and most important projects of the last decade,1

20014,finding the premise intriguing and reading the reviews and being an angel fan i watched this movie it s sexy and original and quite entertaining david boreanaz is keith he s a hunky married man stay at home dad and he feels a little inadequate in his marriage he makes the mistake of penetrating a close circle of teenage girls who are fascinated with the idea of doing it with an older man they ll do anything to get into his bed including beg lie and blackmail but they mostly try to push his buttons the nuttiness that ensues sends keith reeling and pushes friendships to the edge david boreanaz shows a little skin in this one and he s looking hot yes he plays a sleazy cheat but he shows enough vulnerability and tenderness toward the goofy teens that you end up cheering for him in the end one more thing when someone moans oh yeah oh oh yeah it s hard to see them as a victim of rape,1
698,i just watched atoll k laurel and hardy s last movie together and known here in the states as utopia on internet archive expecting to see some extra footage since the ia version had a running time of 2 hours and 21 minutes turns out that it s basically the same version i previously watched on the bargain basement vhs tape from goodtimes home video that ran an hour and 23 minutes with the exception of no product placement of the welch s grape juice label being inserted when a bottle was shown with the rest of the running time devoted to dark blank space while stan does look like he might be dying anytime soon he still performs fine physical comedy with ollie during much of the first 45 minutes or so then the plot of taking a yacht with a stowaway and a man with no country aboard not to mention a charming female french singer also coming to inhabit an uncharted island they all end up on takes over with eventual complications that pretty much bogs the comedy down and never really recovers despite the familiar ending of ollie saying for the last time to stan here s another nice mess you ve gotten me into before stan cries uncontrollably before the fade out in other words if you re a die hard laurel and hardy fan this movie is recommended for you to see at least once anyone else wanting to get familiar with this classic comedy team should seek their earlier work they did for hal roach from the 20s up through 1940 when they completed their final roach film saps at sea come to think of it even some of the l h fox flicks have yet to see the two they made for m g m from the 40s are better than this one update 8 29 09 just watched some missing scenes that appeared in the italian version on youtube cherie sings in one and has a conversation with the captain in another that captain s wife pulls a gun on cherie in one more giovanni explains why he left his country with a flashback scene stan is dubbed in high pitch here,0
20049,a fine romantic comedy errol flynn shows what a deft touch for comedy he possessed a talent that probably shows some of his true prankster self the comedic writing on this film is excellent eleanor parker does a nice job as flynn s ex wife whom errol is trying to win back eleanor is also easy on the eyes the sets exude 1940 s glamour and style where appropriate flynn s comedic timing and wit are displayed to full effect here watch his double takes his ability to verbally counter punch with a snappy comeback or act the straight man and his total believability and sincerity where required this guy could act it is a shame errol did not get a chance to do more roles like this throughout his career he was multi talented to the extreme if you enjoyed it happened one night with gable and colbert or some of the william powell and myrna loy comedies you will enjoy this well paced and lots of laughs a lost diamond of a movie,1
3354,this world war ii film set in borneo tries so hard to work on so many levels it is a shame it fails on all of them nick nolte is an escaping american who witnesses the executions of his comrades by the japanese he wanders deep into the jungles of borneo lost cue nigel havers who finds nolte s adopted tribe nolte now looking like robert plant has become his tribe s new king he defeated a staunch warrior in a bloody battle and had a telling tattoo on his chest a dragon now before you go out and get a painful tattoo and a one way ticket to borneo things are not going well in nolteland havers wants the tribe s help in fighting the japanese who are invading the island he teaches the natives how to use machine guns and a whole lot o shooting begins as the tribe becomes more successful they run up against a new squadron of japanese who are not like the others this squad cannibalizes the villages they conquer in order to keep their strength up talk about your sushi and they move through the jungles even quicker than the tribe since we know the outcome of the war we know eventually the tribe triumphs but with heavy casualties here come the spoilers havers is injured and returned to civilization he gives the location of the kingdom and nolte is captured havers then goes through the trouble of releasing nolte and the end credits roll milius direction is certainly adequate but the screenplay here is rather vague in its motivations it presents story ideas then abandons them in order to get to the next story idea nolte is awful as the soldier turned king desperately trying to channel the spirit of marlon brando s colonel kurtz he talks about freedom and the beauty of the jungle and the richness of his people and you will not believe for one second the words he utters he is often unintentionally funny especially his initial bug out in the jungle and he spends the rest of the film sounding like a hippie nigel havers spends the movie looking at nolte like he was raquel welch the vague homosexual undercurrent between the two goes beyond friendship not quite to sex and settles into an unspoken relationship that must have had the natives talking havers often stands around and has an internal conflict repulsed at the tribe s headhunting but basking in nolte s attention his fellow straight laced british servicemen go native faster than the bounty landing party in tahiti but all i saw concerning borneo is that it is very humid and has lots of green the climactic betrayal where havers gives away nolte s location is completely devoid of any reason there is not one thought given as to why havers does this except to keep the film going i was angry when by chance havers and nolte end up on the same ship going to the philippines the ship happens to run aground and havers runs to the hold to free the freshly shorn nolte no goodbye kiss but havers says farewell to the king explaining the title if you were fighting a war and an enemy squadron was eating your allies would that not freak you out this elite japanese squad is not shown enough although their eating habits are so horrific i would become a conscientious objector right away the same type of ghostly enemy was handled much better in the 13th warrior other types of interesting ideas are dropped what about the fact that then modern technology brings about the deaths of so many backward people why did king nolte let the brits use his subjects without too much hesitation why can t hollywood find a decent actor to play general douglas macarthur in the end farewell to the king is a letdown not anchored by a strong lead and trying to be too many things without thinking and exploring its options i cannot recommend this one this film is rated pg13 for strong physical violence strong gun violence some gore some profanity some sexual references and adult situations,0
16677,the buddy holly story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink in 1956 lubbock texas as the credits start the camera moves down from the moon to the parking lot into the roller rink past the concessions and across the rink to a small bandstand where a small band is doing their sound check it s a tracking shot welles and scorcese would both appreciate it cuts to buddy holly s bespectacled face peering down in rapt concentration as he grips the headphones and talks to a man putting this band on the radio a young gary busey plays buddy holly and his performance is key he has to somehow show the passion that holly had for his music to make the film work this is a rock and roll story without lines of coke chased with shots of heroin and a fifth of whiskey this isn t about a man with several women to choose between in a sex scandalized brood abandoned lusty tragedy this is a film about a nice texas boy who respected his parents and went to church and had the same girlfriend for 5 years and fell in love with rock and roll busey finds that spark and ignites it his passion is clear and infectious he really plays the guitar in the film and sings its not overdubbed with holly s recordings busey was a young guy in hollywood in the seventies a struggling actor and as much or more so a struggling rock musician as well thus he gives a great performance because although he isn t buddy holly he s in a similar situation his first song is the old les paul classic mockingbird hill and he has the country twang to nail it next a kid calls out for some bop and against his two band mates in reality the crickets were 3 guys but the down sizing works fine for the film s limited narrative he leads them wailing into rocking with ollie vee the kids love it and the parents hate it the dj at the rolling rink tapes it and it is later released in new york without buddy holly even knowing it was ever recorded this leads to the funniest scene in a film filled with humorous moments an amped up disc jockey from buffalo calls up buddy at home the dj has been playing that ll be the day for 12 hours and is going for 24 the cops are banging on the station s barricaded door holly is confused but when the dust settles he is quite thrilled he tells the boys and their meteoric rise begins dan stroud as the drummer and charles martin smith as the bassist round out the band nicely and have good chemistry with each other there are problems but not overblown drama thats found in most rock all biopics the movie doesn t manipulate you either your emotions soar but they re not manipulated when the crickets step onto the apollo stage in harlem the first white group ever to play there then rip into an electrically charged performance of oh boy and win the audience over my rock and roll loving ass got choked up and cried next busey and the boys make it s so easy sound funkier and more soulful than i would have believed possible anyone with even a cursory knowledge of buddy holly s story will know where this movie will end holly died in a plane crash with richie valens and the big bopper way too young we as the audience know that yet the movie is so well written directed and lovingly acted that we forget it almost immediately the movie isn t about his death it s about his life and his place in rock and roll history the film ends with his last performance and it s a good fifteen minutes of busey rocking out possessed by the ghost of buddy holly i was happy to hear him end it on not fade away my favorite of his songs the film freezes before the end credits with the information about the plane crash but i hardly noticed it i was still thinking about how good that last song was,1
13879,this film is titled junior pilot here on imdb but final approach at netflix go figure the movie is a delight for both the target youth audience and for adults who can suspend their maturity long enough to watch this film through the eyes of their own youth for the adult the story is quite predictable and perhaps trite and melodramatic whereas the tale may seem new and creative to youngsters who have not yet seen or read many films or books with such a story line in any case credit must be given to the film s creators particularly the director james becket and the cinematographer denis maloney for making this most entertaining and visually interesting film the cut aways to the young protagonist ricky s fantasy thoughts are hilarious as well as delightfully filmed the young actors give uniformly believable performances seemingly quite invested in their roles silly as many scenes are jordan garrett plays the protagonist ricky with quite well having excellent camera presence jeffrey tedmori creates a delightfully soft and sensitive shashi who of all ridiculous things thrives on hot sauce skyler samuels and adam cagley give solid performances as well as is typical of his always fine acting larry miller creates a solid parental figure around which the children s part real part fantasy world revolves compared to his father figure the other major adult roles appear to be shallow and one dimensional intentionally and quite humorously so to be sure this movie is a simplistic youth targeted story of course yet it is quite entertaining perhaps repeatedly so to the targeted youth crowd but also for at least one viewing by adults who retain the ability to view such a film from their once youthful perspective,1
5423,the use of astral projection wandering soul to exist outside of body with the result inflicting horrible death crushing the insides of victims leading to broken spine and ruptured organs on those close to the one with such ability is the threat of eternal evil providing karen black as janus with another unique character to fool around with as a woman who influences a commercial director paul sharpe winston rekert tired of his waning marriage and dull career in actuality she s dying and needs his body her spirit potentially harmful to his wife and son his son has a special friend who talks him into things even poisoning himself at one point a detective kauffman john novak investigating the unusual homicides concerning those killed by the benevolent spirit links paul to the deaths and through him uncovers janus soon both realize that janus must be stopped or she ll simply move to another human host what paul doesn t know is that his new secretary is janus lover both were actually older intellectuals featured in his documentary of astral projection called wandering soul director george mihalka my bloody valentine certainly creates a weird atmosphere with this movie which contains a rather bizarre premise it seems that paul s boy can see the spirit moving in the shape of a blue man manipulating the kid into disorderly conduct black despite the star treatment rarely is shot close up taking advantage of her face which can produce the type of malevolent evil her character warrants instead she s shot from afar her voice dubbed and she never quite establishes herself with the proper menace which is an opportunity lost in my opinion for some reason despite the intriguing if oddball idea of astral projection causing a spirit to kill folks from within the film just never takes off the soundtrack is very yanni ish and the lighting and sound while at times moody and effective often is quite murky the pacing is a problem also as the story mules along the cast is rather limp especially rekert in the lead his performance erratic at best it doesn t help that there are few characters except paul s wife we could care less about and what really hurts is that paul himself isn t exactly the most lovable person in the world he can be quite difficult and moody his unfulfilled career a reason for such behavior black should ve been a more prominent figure in the film yet remains mostly in the background talked about in dialogue between paul and kauffman but rarely does she get a chance to amuse us with her histrionics which is a shame,0
18217,black water is a movie that in a way surprised me and definitely exceeded my original expectations black water is truly a very well structured unpredictable thrilling well directed and well creepy movie the plot is actually somewhat original and will definitely keep you intrigued with it one thing i love about this movie is the direction because mainly on how it surpassed my original expectations my original expectations of black water was that it was a crappily made acted directed paced and boring movie it really wasn t well the acting is nothing to praise because there were times were i feel they didn t show enough emotions and there are some lines that feel just so scripted however i love the direction because all of it s shots seem predictable but arn t like when watching it say the camera gets a slow shot of the water and it goes quite you re like the croc s about to attack however the croc s attacks are very unpredictable which was bad for me who doesn t handle films like this all to greatly and this does make you jump plus i just love that it s one of those horror movies that don t rely on the sudden big sound blast to make you jump but instead the actual movie i also like how the story is about people who are trapped in these trees it made it seem very real and definitely kept your eyes on the screen i must say i didn t think the opening 20 so minutes were done well and i think they made the boat a little heavier than it would have been in real life plus i didn t like how they tried their absolute best to make the characters situation seem entirely hopeless when it really wasn t also again i just don t think some of the characters actions were realistic for example i wouldn t have gone anywhere near the water knowing their was a crocodile in it let alone a killer one however these problems really arn t that major and i was still able to enjoy the film overall as far as movies go i ve seen better but as far as animal attack horror films a genre i get easily scarred at it s one of the better ones you ll see and sure it s not perfect but that doesn t mean it s not worth a shot,1
24249,spheeris debut must be one of the best music documentaries of all time and as far as i know it s also the only one that focuses on the l a punk explosion of the early eighties it s all there not just great great bands like black flag fear x the germs whose names may not mean much to you today but whose influence on today s alternative rock music can not be over estimated but also the promoters the media and first of all the audiences the punks all portrayed in a manner that makes you laugh shudder and gasp with astonishment about the energy the anger and the fury these youths put into their music where is that today the eighties may have sucked big time when it cames to mainstream music but the underground was rocking if you need a proof for that watch fear s performance in decline unmatched great film how come this is not available on vid ld or dvd p s the follow up decline pt ii is hilarious too,1
18677,like one of the other reviewers might have been amazon i was first introduced to tourist trap by the beloved decrepit old wor 9 in ny around january 1983 devil dog the hound of hell which i d been waiting to see since it debuted on halloween 1978 had just ended and i thought i d had my horror fill for the day quit laughing that three eyed borgost sp monster ike eisenmann draws up in his room is scary for as much as i still enjoy richard crenna wearing his made for tv horror hat it was the first 10 minutes of tourist trap following devil dog that day that really left a mark and months later it ended up being the first movie i ever taped off tv wor used to play this fairly frequently often as the saturday afternoon million dollar movie as others have observed it s one of those offerings that delivers a powerful horror punch up front a veritable left hook and then practically starts over with the rest of the cast dances and jabs putting the opening scene a larger context along the way then moves on to the real climax see night of the living dead re animator two paragraphs and i haven t mentioned a single mannequin face it the damn things are scary enough without the music and the script i too can remember some scary dress dummies and the like in various relatives attics and basements and say what you like about how relatively straightforward schmoeller and carroll s approach is no one before or since has played it this well in real life a good mannequin will make you do a double take and here that s about the last thing you re likely to see if you happen to be stuck at slausen s defunct wax museum and roadside stand yes there is a point i loved her very much where chuck slausen connors is trying to pass for vincent price yes the plot might have taken up all of a paragraph in the early stages i can t see the script being all that thick it doesn t matter from direction to competent acting meryl streep s emphatically not in attendance and here that helps instead of hinders to another useful and effective pino dinaggio score see carrie and various other de palma movies to various lighting film stock use of varying sound levels i could go on every element of this low budget production comes together and you get a work very much greater than the sum of its parts did i mention it s scary as hell stephen king talked this movie up in danse macabre a year or so after its release and with good reason like much of his work it may not be great art but it sure does tell a scary story and does it well the rest of the cast may be relatively unknown wasn t jocelyn jones in that texas car chase movie as well but chuck connors and tanya roberts were and are just familiar enough to audiences to make you think stephen king style that this could happen to you or people you know comparisons to psycho plot and the texas chainsaw massacre overall look and feel even if they aren t the first associations in my mind are valid i only wish i could comment on the dvd which i look forward to buying as tourist trap has become notoriously hard to find on video since the near complete extinction of independent video rental outlets where it had a home aside from wor and cable in the 1980s though tmc showtime appear to have picked it up and play it regularly now no no spoilers here i m afraid no plot breakdown go see it yourself all right there may be a tiny little one below so scroll away if you like better safe than sorry the mannequins are damn scary and i d rather show than tell for the record tourist trap is also chock full of great lines from we are going to have a party how do i look huh how do i look to you re so pretty you can t hurt me i shouldn t have to hide it it feels good listen for that vincent price inflection again there the inevitable you re crazy delivered at the right moment and in the right tone and try just try to keep the hair on your arms down when you hear the mannequin s head screaming molly especially once you realize whose head it used to be p s charles band was the producer on this i believe and likely owned the rights to dinaggio s music band from what i understand was the brains behind full moon entertainment which might explain both the music s subsequent use in puppet master and well the 40 commercial approach has characterized full moon throughout from the enjoyable puppet master and subspecies franchises to uhhh trancers and bad channels sorry boc,1
1693,this movie really has nothing going for it with the reverend played by phillip seymour hoffman complaining about his constipation and other toilet humor in a 2 5 hour movie you know that they made no cuts at all and left the crap in literally it s a waste of good talent and a total embarrassment dreadful,0
14706,i just saw everything is illuminated at the telluride film festival this is a truly remarkable film very emotional funny at times and heart warming bring your handkerchiefs for those of you who enjoy a movie that brings tears to your eyes i m reminded of the endings of babette s feast and the notebook the stories were completely different but had that same emotional power to bring tears to my eyes just as this film did no spoilers here the summary is as imdb describes a young man s journey to the ukraine to follow his roots and find the village where his father grew up the dialog is in english and ukrainian and russian too i believe this allows for some wonderfully linguistically based moments as one character interprets more or less faithfully for the english speaker in the group depending on the circumstances the scenery is wonderful and the musical score is a treat with wonderful eastern european influences be sure you stay through the credits for the final tune this is lieve schreiber s directorial debut and is well done i give this film a 9 one of the best films i ve seen in a long time i recommend it highly,1

16178,i have to admit that i approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread louis de berniere s bestselling novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be 100 faithful all the way through i found myself convincing myself that the movie was unsuccessful and had stripped the book s plot back so far as to render it redundant the ending however is much better than that in the novel and i could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards still the plusses john toll s magnificent cinematography stephen warbeck s great score etc i felt did not outweigh my initial negatives cage s miscasting a heavily diluted script but two days later i was queuing again to see corelli and although not perfect i have to admit now that the movie is the best anyone could have expected cage is actually brilliant in a role that even de berniere was concerned was not a fully rounded character his carefree spirit which gives way to shattered remorse is spot on and complements the superb double act of penelope cruz and john hurt perfectly david morrissey is quietly effective as weber the nazi officer trying to reconcile his feelings for his newfound italian friends and his inbred superiority complex to those around him and the fine greco italian supporting cast bring de berniere s sundrenched world of cepholonia dazzlingly alive on leaving the cinema second time around i finally let go my passion for the novel which prevented me from fully appreciating the story of ww2 cepholonia in cinematic terms my hat goes off to john madden who despite the almost expected critical drubbing he is receiving from the british critics any director who has had a major success like shakespeare in love behind them is always a target for these moaning ninnies has managed to transfer a terrifically difficult book to the big screen with such heart verve and humanity the core virtues of the novel in fact that he has created another classic love story that will probably only be fully appreciated when the dust has settled a few years from now if you are a fan of the book like me it s hard but try not to make the same mistake on your initial viewing try to erase the book from your mind for two hours bathe yourself in the glorious mediterranean atmosphere and discover corelli pelagia mandras dr iannis as if for the first time pretend you re watching something made from an original screenplay and i guarantee you won t be disappointed in fact you ll be eagerly waiting to own your own copy of this delightful movie on video or dvd 8 10,1
19578,better than the original the gamers dorkness rising manages to pull off a funny comedy with good acting fine special effects and comedy that transcends the gamer knowledge base and do so on a low budget i ve seen many low budget films that have been terrible and almost none that have been as good as their high budget counterparts this film blows most mainstream movies away parts are a bit weak the bit with the pirates and ninjas while funny goes on a bit long without explanation and takes you out of the movie for a bit but overall this is a very strong film i m very happy to say that i bought this film as soon as i saw it and brought it home any chance we can look forward to another feature gamers movie from these guys,1
18238,nobi or fires on the plain is a film that is so excellent on so many levels that not enough good things can be said about it my only regret is that i was not able to see this 1959 film sooner being something of a film purist i tend to look at films for their artistic merits based upon dialog acting photography and even the efforts to remain true to the period in terms of costume ultimately i want to know if the film is truthful enough in revealing the human condition to make me think without oppressing me with what the director wants me to think fires on the plain is a great film because it crafts a portrait filled with realistic human reactions to the dying fires of a great historical catastrophe ichikawa s film is a condemnation of war on all levels as any good war film should be war is horrifying bloody destructive it is also murderous on the psyche however what is fundamental about fires on the plain is its unapologetic look at the japanese soldiers it shows them slowly collapsing under the weight of superior american firepower and their nation s inability to wage a war of its own making a fatalistic code encouraging death before surrender is at the heart of this madness i was astonished to see such an honest and brutally close look at the bitter fruits of japan s military misadventure made just 14 years after the end of what the japanese call the great pacific war ichikawa reveals what the germans called the war life the plight of the common soldier ichikawa s film is interesting since even today japan is having a hard time fully coming to terms with its wartime fanaticism its subjugation of conquered peoples the racism of its war against the chinese and war crimes which included cannibalism by soldiers and officers practiced not only against one another but against allied prisoners of war ichikawa produces a stark representation of the victimization of soldiers by a confluence of bad political decisions and cultural pressures this stark examination is skillfully done by portraying the doomed soldiers as human beings who exhibit at various times fear brilliantly laconic humor dialog enriched by its sparseness and a plot whose complexity is belied by the grim wilderness setting ichikawa s portrait is a ragged and painful tapestry of defeated men the tubercular tamura played as a woebegone and gentle soul by eiji funakoshi is a good soldier who can t abandon his humanity though he is as frightened and lost as his comrades before he departs for a hospital that will reject him as too healthy tamura is given a hand grenade by a superior who recognizing the hopelessness of their situation advises tamura to kill himself why tamura s hopelessly ill supplied and militarily incapable unit was not ordered to surrender at the start of the film is telling ichikawa makes it plain that the war is over and everyone is merely waiting to die as tamura leaves his unit for his hopeless search for physical and spiritual salvation he sees his comrades pointlessly digging an air raid shelter they appear like corpses looking up from their own mass grave we later watch as the overworked hospital s medical staff abandons the dying patients to an all consuming american artillery barrage the pathetic patients who crawl from their huts in a vain attempt to survive appear like pathetic serpentine creatures dragging themselves from an omnipotent force you know they won t survive ichikawa makes it plain that the only thing worse than a defeated army is one that has lost its honor by abandoning its humanity and its comrades as tamura staggers through the jungles of leyte we encounter the noble the dying and the exploitive cannibalism rears its ugly head as soldiers begin to eat one another rather than surrender to american corned beef when the men do talk of surrender the propaganda of how americans kills prisoners is countered by a worldly wise soldier who reveals that the approaching americans feed and care for prisoners of war because they unlike the japanese respect brave soldiers who are forced to give up it is the japanese who intend to die fighting for the emperor long after resistance has lost all meaning those willing to fight to the death will be killed it is the calculus of war after shooting a murderous and cannibalistic comrade whom he earlier offered his own body to as food the fatalistic tamura s careless surrender also seems to be an intentional form of suicide his death is a lonely image was ichikawa trying to tell us of the internal conflict of the ordinary soldier who wants to live but who is still trapped by his nation s suicidal cultural codes if someone watches this film carefully he or she will see that absolutism and fanaticism is the enemy the americans are portrayed as a technologically advanced people willing to employ that technology in the form of inexorable military power a lesson that transformed japanese postwar society ichikawa s film isn t so shallow that it indicts america ichikawa indicts the sedimentary layers of japan s destructive policies that created the war and then to continue it when all was lost ichikawa does not mention the nuclear weapons dropped upon nagasaki and hiroshima he doesn t have to the slow motion destruction of the imperial japanese army in the philippines reveals the seeds of japan s immolation,1
2180,when my mum went down to the video store to rent a film for the night my sister and i learned a lesson to always company my mum to the video store in fact the only reason why she chose it was because colin firth was in it and she cough thinks he s a good actor it starts off with some beautiful veiws of africa and then goes down and down and down and down after this film i was very surprised that colin firth got as far as he did since this pointless film could destroy any actors career the story is about a divorced women who s son is trying to matchmake her to a man called matthew fields who he met whilst impressing his friends because of his large house nimi the divorce does not like matthew at all and is going out with the local vicar who does not like her son john and the same with him i am sorry if you disagree with me and i hope i haven t offended you but to all the people who haven t seen this film i leave you with one word of warning don t watch this film,0
16263,in one of the best of charlie chaplin s lengthier short films he places the little fellow in the trenches of wwi where he brings his intolerable politeness and endless patience to the drudgery of trench life where troops lived for months at a time before finally going over the top to overtake the enemy and usually to their deaths it takes someone of chaplin s skill as a comedian to make something as dreary as trench warfare into such a brilliant comedy but the irony that he uses in the film makes even the most uncomfortable conditions highly amusing like all of the best of chaplin s films short films and otherwise this one is packed with brilliant and memorable scenes such as the scene where he marks off kills with a piece of chalk on a board in the trench erasing one when he gets his helmet shot off the scene where he and his fellow soldiers are sleeping underwater the opening of the beer bottle and lighting of the cigarette and of course the overtaking of the enemy all of these scenes are show stoppers reminiscent of the most wonderful chaplin scenes this one should not be missed,1
345,i m not going to bother mentioning any of the plot this is strictly a b movie on its way to obscurity the shock to me though is seeing what has become of some of the actors in this film erika eleniak never anything you d call a thespian anyway seems to have morphed into anna nicole smith in her big period daniel bernhardt i almost shed a tear he s always been a favorite of mine because of his martial arts prowess as seen in the bloodsport series also b movies but if you like martial arts eminently watchable here he is a shell of his former self sure he s older but doing the mercenary thing and not even looking interested i just don t get it don t these people invest william forsythe is another heavy that i ve always liked but his last several roles are what you would call mailing it in i m not going to even mention mr reynolds his gig here amounts to a throwaway nothing more the only winner is andrew divoff as usual a creepy evil pockmarked villain with a sandpaper voice that can curdle milk the best kind this is a movie you watch for laughs there s nothing else to it,0
21384,like so many other reviewers on here my memories of this show are universally warm in fact so fond are said cherished memories that i recently purchased the dvd box set in order to revisit that happy and carefree period of childhood whereby i used to sit utterly mesmerised as i watched the ongoing quest of monkey pigsy sandy tripitaka and later yu lung a horse dragon man you ll really need to watch it to understand when the much loved show initially aired on bbc 2 on friday evenings as i recall well i m pleased to say that even after all these years and now viewing this with adult i e more cynical eyes the show has lost none of its inimitable charm simply wonderful entertainment from the magical characters and their comical interactions with one another to the perhaps not so special effects which actually serve to heighten the fun and of course not forgetting the hugely memorable opening title sequence from the first season the passing of time has not in any way shape or form diminished any of monkey s spellbinding charm as monkey himself would probably say oi you there go out and grab yourself some nostalgic fun,1
18887,i think this is pauly shore s best stuff he played the part perfect i really enjoyed this movie patrick renna is really funny as zack the annoying little brother son in law is a good comedy worth your time but the only thing i wish tiffany thiessen was the farm chick instead of the one they had,1
10789,this movie seems as if someone had a cute idea for a movie thought of two or three funny possibilities hired a good cast then turned the whole thing over to a really bad screenwriter and even worse director the director filmed a screwball romantic comedy as if it were a dark artsy film weird camera angles blue filtered shots lingering close up looks at raindrops steve zahn was good as always ben affleck was charming sweet almost shy he was perfect for a romantic comedy sandra bullock struggled along valiantly with a character who was supposed to be zany but whose wackiness consisted of things like madly kissing a husband she hated abandoning her child going on carnival rides offering to strip for money and bumming a ride with a fellow airline passenger the script had very few funny lines there was no physical comedy it was boring it introduced potentially funny situations then cut them off before they could develop to top it all off the twist at the end was a slap in the face to anyone expecting a fun romantic comedy if you saw the trailer for the movie and liked it as i did my advice is don t go to the movie it will only spoil a nice trailer,0
22815,this sad romance is untellable because the director decides to break its narration and to offer the points of view of each characters so there are a lot of flashbacks of re shooting of the same scene but it would be an extraordinary moment of cinema to put all the fragments in order to see the result and it would worth it because it s for me just one the best french movie ever made it has everything cast first steps of monica bellucci and vincent cassel such a presence and such voices even for a hard of hearing it s symbolic for them to have fallen in love with this movie directing his camera is bright alive plays with the sets or can be mysterious with long close up la david lynch cinematography the light is beautiful between gold and rust like their love a never seen before paris it s a paris out of time of more accurately a composite of a lot of districts huge search here it s look like gotham city modern and old at the same time music not the big orchestra but in perfect tune with the frames and the song of charles aznavour made me discover this great singer ah the story as i said it s a love story but rather tragic saying that love can be for nothing that it doesn t make all people happy or isn t guaranteed for a sweet ending is great because this message isn t often told love is passion which is derivative from the latin pain you can suffer a lot when you are in love because of the why of the endless waiting the lack of courage the indecision and when you can ease yourself fate destiny god devil can stab you in the back just because you arrive too soon or too late and above all because love means 2 in a world of billions a lot of things can happen and as much stories can be written so what s love personally i lived some moments like this in a car with the dear one her mobile rings and you know it s her special friend whom she kisses goodbye and not you even if we are always together so you want to go out of this car to leave them together to not hear the sweet but cruel words but you can t because an amazing hard rain just started i found that this movie depicts those moments of tragedy as no one else,1
928,as their entire career was a pale impersonation of the beatles it is no surprise that shortly after the great fiasco of the beatles magical mystery tour the monkees would follow up with their own insipid and creative morass of a movie called head both movies are not so much a true story with a plot though mmt attempted to define a plot as they are a hodge podge of skits and snippets interspersed with music and songs and out takes head has no plot other than the pre fab four trying to break free of the box they are in i e the type casting of being monkees and the surrounding commercialism and yet always finding themselves back in the box most skits involve breaks in the fourth wall and crossing over into other seemingly unrelated scenes filled with anti vietnam war messages and attempts by the group to show their other talents the film bounces around haphazardly also to be blamed on the multiple directors the film like magical mystery tour is now excused by some fans as wonderful symbolism and misunderstood artistic statements phooey like mmt it is too many guys with access to too many drugs all trying to make something artsy and making crap like mmt head has some clever moments and offers some relatively unknown monkees songs that are quite decent it does develop a bit more charm than mmt and is a bit easier to sit through but it is not ironic at all that like everything else the monkees did this was just a mimicry of something the beatles did first even when it comes to laying an egg,0
19263,a beautiful magical thought provoking and heart warming story excellent direction perfect cast marvellous script excellent score beautifully lit need i say more if you love films that not only make you think but also warm your heart some that spring to mind are contact field of dreams and groundhog day then you re sure to love k pax most highly recommended,1
20721,the chipmunk adventure there are some movies that i could watch all my life and never grow tired of them and this nostalgic favorite is one of them the chipmunk adventure was a 1987 attempt to bring the old favorites back to the forefront of animation this time on the big screen in an age when disney dominated the film industry in terms of animation quality and box office the chipmunk adventure stands as one of the best animated films that disney didn t produce in the 80 s the story is simple and elementary having alvin simon theodore compete in an around the world race with the chipettes janette eleanor brittany however as the chipmunks encounter exotic dangers they are unaware that they are the pawns in a major diamond heist the chipmunk adventure never was and never will be a film that soars thanks to an engrossing plot and to people who didn t love it as a child the film will probably never be more then an enjoyable yet forgettable animated movie but for me it will always be a little known masterpiece something about the film just clicks for me in a way few films do every song is fun upbeat and harmless highlights include the chipettes in a slightly risqu arabian dance to calm snakes there s also a very sweet song in which the chipmunks sing about traveling the world and we get to see them at major landmarks throughout the globe one thing about the chipmunk characters is that despite the potentially annoying vocals the songwriters always managed to write songs that were catchy without ever being grating this film is no exception it actually boasts one of the best animated movie soundtracks of the 80 s if you ask me every joke is cute sincere and amusing the bits between the bad guys and a pampered puppy are very amusing and the shock of seeing the chipettes nearly forced into marriage by a child emperor is as well the comedy manages to constantly play to the kids so that they don t miss anything but everything remains charming for the adults with enough nostalgia to keep them entertained it s really just a fun trip that is completely humble in it s ambitions the chipmunk adventure never aims to be anything more then it is harmless fun i ll be the first to admit this is a biased review because i have such a nostalgic fondness for the chipmunk adventure that i would never be able to give it a bad review but nonetheless it fills me with such a childish contentment while watching it everyone has their random favorite from childhood that no one knows and for me it s this movie and any film that i can watch over and over whether i am 5 12 23 or older is a great film in my eyes a,1
3766,so this guy goes into a psychiatrist s office for his first appointment after the paperwork is done the psychiatrist says i m going to show you ink blots tell me what you see in them well says the patient looking at the first one i see a man and a woman having sex on seeing the second one he says i see two women having sex on seeing the third he says i see two men having sex on seeing the next one he says i see two men and two women having sex the psychiatrist puts down the the inkblots so he says we ll start by discussing your monomania my monomania says the guy and you with all these dirty pictures that s how this movie strikes me,0
14776,though the video technology may be dated this classic musical play now on dvd is the best version of sondheim s most important and polished work on broadway if you ve never seen sweeney todd then you must buy this dvd i saw this production in november 1980 at kennedy center in washington and fell in love with a pre murder she wrote angela lansbury subsequently i tried to find any and all of her work among them movies the harvey girls the picture of dorian gray manchurian candidate cds mame dear world and gypsy and many more the rest of the cast is flawless too all in all this wonderful dvd gives us the definitive version of sondheim s opera,1
9474,although many billie dove fans are delighted with her work here i have to pass as a socially prominent member of the british smart set her british accent is basically non existent and her line readings sound just like well line readings and her emoting seems trance like and ponderous basil rathbone usually a fine actor seems off kilter throughout and also speaks with a weird sort of accent in his case something like italian though we cannot be sure the script manages to keep his precise ethnicity a secret he is further hampered by the script which gives him one of those old movie diseases something to do with nerves which requires surgery the only real entertainment is provided by the illustrious kay francis sporting a lacquered bob with side curls in her role as a depraved countess who shamelessly devours men including rathbone and then spits them out she pulls it off with her unique aplomb she is the only living thing in this dead sea of a film,0
20246,i love this movie and all aspects of it well directed as a comedy and as a drama the acting is tremendous performed by an all star cast who play the high society new york perfectly the scenery is incredible totally breathtaking i also love the story a successful nyc architect who is going through a midlife crisis leaves his cheating wife and runs off to a greek island to hide out with his daughter who chooses to go with him i just cannot express my love affair enough regarding this movie show me the magic,1
8135,dreadful film about a doctor who goes fishing and winds up catching a mermaid when he is thrown overboard she traps him into bringing her back with him glynis johns in the title role is really a silly individual with a tail hanging out margaret rutherford is the nurse who is supposed to be so eccentric but we see no eccentricity here in fact miss rutherford was not allowed to use her true comedic gifts nice to see david tomlinson in the film he would get together with johns in the far superior mary poppins 16 years later miranda causes mischief in that two guys a neighbor s fianc e and chauffeur tomlinson fall for her ask any mermaid you happen to see what s the best tuna chicken of the sea as for this film forget it,0
6376,i saw this video at a friends house and it was the lamest thing i have seen ever i lost a lot of the little respect i had for nin very boring and the music is as equally interesting dont waste your time unless you are a hardcore nin fan,0
18063,having watched the show for about four weeks which is enough to get a feel for the show i think it shows potential whilst much is borrowed from other shows what sci fi doesn t these days and the characters are stereotyped i like what they are doing with the stories there is some continuity with plot development and character interaction relationship building despite the essentially modular nature of each episode there have been some science related topics explored as well as character secret weakness revelations these have also added some comedy to the show something i would gladly see more of in serious sci fi in all this makes for good balance such that can appeal to larger groups of people unlike the star trek vs babylon 5 debates i ve been numerous participant and witness to the visual aspects of the show are more than adequate and well budgeted for a first season the acting is acceptable and i am curious to see how well the actors manage to grow their characters out of their scripted stereotypes i see enough positives and potential to remain interested in seeing where the show wants to go,1
1484,it s hard to decide what to say about this one it isn t totally one hundred percent bad although the movie in a movie is unspeakably bad meant to be campy but missing by a mile i m pretty sure that this is intentional however danny aiello is perfectly adequate here and more or less nails his pathetic character dyan cannon was good in a small role clotilde courau was impressive as the latest twenty something girlfriend and linda carlson had a brave topless scene that she pulled off very well so it s not totally bad but i don t believe that this one accomplishes its goals all in all it s probably worth passing on,0
5240,flashdance is one of those awful stupid movies that you actually kind of enjoy just because they re so crap i just watched it on tv my friend and i were amazed at how dopey it was it s true that don simpson and the other producers came up with the idea of a fairly cheap lowbrow flick with lots of sweaty bodies to help sell a soundtrack of admitedly catchy pop so flashdance is an odd sort of pioneer the first mtv movie adrian lyne started out in advertising and it shows because flashdance is almost a commercial for itself you ve already decided to watch it but the movie has this weird panicky undercurrent as though it s frightened that you might change your mind at any moment it keeps selling itself to you over and over all the way through using slick commercial style editing and glossy close ups of jiggling breasts the story is wafer thin i honestly can t think of another film i ve seen with less plot and it never makes much sense but its a very contrived calculating movie so it feels consistent people say it s dated but flashdance was always rubbish viewers in the early 80 s knew it was just cheesy t a but it does work in its own silly fashion there s soppy romance for the chick flick crowd and stacks of oily writhing female bodies for their dates all set to a pumping disco beat how could it fail it helps that the dialogue is pointless so you can grab a popcorn without missing anything major and if this sort of thing isn t your cup of tea you can always laugh at the interpretive dance on display the scene where a stand in for jennifer beals convulses dances on stage in front of a tv with a fan in it and a face full of white clown make up had us in stitches a genuine guilty pleasure,0
22536,why does everyone feel they have to constantly put this movie down it is cute and funny exactly what it is meant to be madonna wasn t out to prove herself as an oscar calliber artist with this movie anyhow she was just doing what the character called for and she did it well i loved her in this movie it is my second favorite madonna movie after evita the soundtrack is excellent too it is no better or no worse than any cheesy 80 s flick to all the critics just don t take it so seriously and you might have fun watching it madonna is a goddess,1
10817,the movie the cave has got to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen there was no plot no story line and the lighting was terrible for most of the movie i was unable to make sense of the scenery as it was being highlighted by flashlights the persistent grey spaces throughout the movie were irksome the only scene that really came through clearly was in the cavern lit by what appeared to be a bad simulation of the conditions to be found in hell all in all the movie was not really worth watching if the producers cannot come up with something better than this they should find another occupation the underwater scenes were particularly awful being mostly made up of bubbles and flashlights with the occasional look at the actors in summation a really awful movie with bad lighting extraneous flashes throughout,0
17944,robin williams shows his stand up talents and boosts up his status as a comedian in this movie of what s wrong in american politics and how can hollywood try to make an influence without boring people of course hollywood uses movies with hidden or not so hidden agendas i think this movie is for people who likes stand up and political discussion and the trailers of this movie were for everybody just to make sure as many people as possible will see this everybody knows hollywood is more liberal democrat than the bush co so they have to make these movies every now and then but this one was perhaps too obvious at least i thought so for making any real change still great stand up and fresh political issues and talks i enjoyed it and thanks to imdb com ratings i was positively surprised when i walked out from the movie theater and yes i laughed many times sometimes you just have to let it go and forget all the seriousness see this movie if you like good and clever stand up or politics and you will not be offended by the several references of how things are not good right now rent it if that doesn t match you,1
21121,synopsis andreas trond fausa aurvaag finds himself alone on a coach getting dropped off on a desert land at what seems the last stop of his journey he doesn t know how he arrived there but a welcome sign has been erected for him after momentarily pondering his whereabouts he is greeted by a man who takes him to his new life he then enters a world different to the one he came from as andreas is quickly introduced to his new job as an accountant he senses that his surroundings are a bit too uniformed for his liking as he takes his first lunch break he instantly notices that everyone in the city walks around in grey suits on this same day he sees a fellow businessman dead on some fencing spikes of what looks like an act of suicide the strange thing is the city folk pay no attention to this horrific act and walk on by as if it never happened it is quick to see that these people are genetically desensitised and their ability to distinguish between anything humane or inhumane is absent to help andreas settle in he is invited to go out with his co workers to a local nightclub the club appears to be one step away from becoming as exciting as a bingo night and as andreas drinks his sorrows aways he realises that no matter how much he drinks the alcohol has no effect on him as he tells these observances to a stranger in the men s room a man in a toilet cubicle starts to utter words which have been on andreas mind all along realising that this man is thinking what he is he follows him to his house and notes where he lives for future reference the plot predictably evolves with andreas wanting an escape he seeks out the man he once followed hoping that he could lead him to becoming human again but is it too late my thoughts this norwegian film is something which everyone should see as it holds the answer to the big question what is the meaning of life well close enough the film sketches out the dark realities of what has become of today s working man or woman it s sole purpose is making people realise that life is too short to be materialistic it tries to show that small clich things such as the sound of children playing should not be taken for granted because the moment you stop hearing that sound is the moment you re one step away from becoming a robot the ending of the film reiterates what happens when its too late to escape the mundane routine you ve now become used to you start to adopt the saying of if it ain t broke don t fix it and become too comfortable to take a risk of change even though this film is not to be taken as a piece of realism its message is more than real the lack of empathy conveyed in the film and that of which andreas sees is a bold statement of what life can become the director jens lien has put together a film which in any other director s hands would have failed this is a fine piece of cinematic genius and i eagerly await to see what he does next the lead role played by trond fausa aurvaag is perfectly cast representing the average joe trond provides a good catalyst in making this picture darkly humorous the supporting actors also do an apt job and for some reason i feel that keanu reeves would have been perfect in this film as most of the supporting cast required their acting to be emotionless the score for this film was beautifully composed the recurring theme was always a delight to listen to and it provided a very sombre but welcomed feel to the movie set for a release date in the uk for 25th may 2007 i will definitely be going to re live this experience on the big screen this film has gained its way in my top 10 now quickly becoming my top 20 it has some shocking scenes and is darkly humorous throughout a must see,1
20043,i am an avid ff7 fan for instance i have the game then sell it bad mistake but then buy it again good mistake erm anyways yes this film is very good the fights are very cool music very good and the cgi you cant falter only thing disappointing with the film i felt was the lack of other character involvement it was almost all cloud which although is a great character u cant beat a of cid and barret but despite that the film was great in my opinion and a must watch overall a great film give and will give it 9 10 squaresoft make more films like this and you ll be worshiped more so than you already are,1
6038,this movie was a waste of time it looks nice pretty settings nicely acted appears earnest and seems to be leading somewhere so you stay tuned awaiting a meaningful payoff it doesn t happen it surprised me that so much effort could be put into a movie it was clearly very professionally done and have an outcome that seems nothing short of a b movie save your precious time and see a good french film like les visiteurs funny jean de florette or manon of the spring i can t recall the language in europa europa but that s another great film heavy but very worth viewing this film appears to promise a lot but delivers nothing,0
10954,my husband wanted to watch this film because the review in the paper said that it was better than fatal attraction well not liking either michael douglas or glenn close i would have to agree not for conventional reasons though this is one of those films that needs to be watched late at night when you don t want to watch something that really requires thought but don t want to go to bed yet yancy butler is a really enjoyable bad guy she is not the best of actresses in fact she isn t even good but she is perfect for this role in this film everyone else in it varies from pine to oak including the slightly disturbing boy who comes across as a warped pinocchio spoiler the ending goes a step or two too far complete with the clich not quite dead up with a roar still gonna get you moment and then there s a shot of pinocchio with his frozen wooden smirk which makes you wonder if they were going for chilling or just forgot there was botox in the make up regardless it s a hilarious eighty odd minutes and despite being a bad film you would have to be lacking the humour gene to not enjoy it somewhat don t pay for it but if you re in that kind of apathetic telly mood then this is just right,0

21525,i love this movie i just saw it for the first time about 10 hours ago and had to rewind it so that my sister could watch it this movie is so funny there are two times that i was laughing so hard my sides hurt i didn t expect to watch a movie so funny i really only wanted to see it because laura fraser is in it i first saw her in titus which is an awesome movie as well like others reviewers have said too many people are expecting a deep moving film you are not going to get it what you will get is humor eye candy and the chance to ask yourself exactly what your perfect mate would look like if you could create them you can also wonder what it would be like to be stuck in the body of the opposite sex a hilarious sequence involves justine first seeing herself as a naked man i was cracking up i swear this movie is the most imaginative teen film that i have ever seen and it is now my favorite just remember why movies were originally created as entertainment not philosophy in motion remember this and you will have a great time watching virtual sexuality,1
22905,the movie begins almost achingly slowly a romance yawn that seems to ramble off course all part of the plan then roughly one hour into this solemn movie is the feast it s worth paying attention to that first hour the feast is still solemn but humorous suddenly the withdrawn and slightly petty characters come to life and everyone you and the characters leave feeling enriched by the experience women will love this christians of all sorts will enjoy the profound faith demonstrated by the characters not my favorite movie of all time no dinosaurs or laser beams after all but definitely a movie i am happy to have seen not to be missed jim,1
15877,this was the one movie to see about the civi war my aunt actually played in this movie as an extra in the justin and madeline wedding scene and my uncle was an extra on a horse the script was genuine and accurate the costumes were tastefully done the seqence was in order and even the accents were good i dearly love patrick swayze and james ried they were the best 2 choices and it even had a great supporting cast the civil war is my favorite thing in american history and i love movies about it i have seen quite a few and this movie and it s sequal north and south book 2 took the cake if you haven t seen it rent it as soon as possible it s quite an eduation,1
2062,in the early 1990 s step by step came as a tedious combination of the ultra cheesy full house and the long defunct loopy classic hit the brady bunch the differences between step by step and the two aforementioned shows was of course better writing excellent comedic timing from almost all of it s actors and a great deal funnier situations that weren t quite as sugar coated as it s extremely popular predecessors admittedly though even with the big boosts in the show s basic dynamics and all it still wasn t exactly spectacular nor was it really even that memorable in the long line of corny family programming it was just a much better time passer you might say in comparison to the cutesy migraine inducing full house which coincidentally ran neck and neck with step by step during that time period in terms of overall popularity the show now in syndication obviously is certainly suitable family fare but be sure to not expect much beyond that when watching it,0
12185,this film could have been great but wasn t amongst the cesspool of talentless no hopers and friends of the film makers who wanted to help out there are some mild inklings of talent the main star of the film plays a good lead role he is convincing and has those scary italian eyes however he is teamed up with the worst rejects of actors anyone has ever come across the opening scenes of the film are among the worst and most embarrassing it looks like gay porno fortunately no one stripped off the rape scene that keeps being mentioned is rubbish the prison sequence was the best part of the film although irrelevant the movies soundtrack if you can call it that sounds like a teenage boys first attempt at using cooledit and some sample cds it is boring repetitive and extremely lame in fact the whole film is lame get out while you still can,0
6316,in the wake of the matrix this travesty of a film with loose connections to vr has been reissued with the tag line the matrix just got deadler in a box with a very matrix inspired cover still called expect to die though due to the choice of font however the tag line looks to all the world like it says beablier anyway to complete the transformation to matrix wannabe they have mocked up a vr fight scene with a morpheus a like on the back of the box it may be important to know that this character does not feature in the film overall this film is a travesty on every level jalal mehri is an awful actor and does not impress with his martial arts however his partner stone is played by evan lurie who in this film is simply the worst actor i have ever seen clearly he was chosen to make jalal look good in comparison worst film i have seen for a long long time,0
6278,yeah i know the girls are hot and the scenery lovely but for someone knowing the place it s hilarious if you want some accuracy this is not a movie to rely on it starts with the flight from s o paulo to rio aboard a 747 this will never happen on the 400 km flight smaller planes such as 737 or a 320 shuttle passengers between the two cities every half an hour the drive from the airport home if shown on a map would reveal an intricate zig zag back and forth perhaps the producers tried to emulate one of the very known taxicab drivers itineraries when faced to tourists not that it would be a local habit as i myself got ripped off in very serious places such as switzerland the girls yes all topless that s something an outsider will never understand brazilian chicks will be happy to expose 100 of their incredible bodies at the samba schools parades and wear almost non existent bikinis at beach but never go topless a handful beaches across the whole country will allow it all carefully secluded and out of town oh the indoor decoration the amazing wallpaper maybe in disneyworld apart from that it is very entertaining and yes demi moore is absolutely splendid,0
14857,four unhappy women leave dreary london to spend an enchanted april in a castle on the coast of italy elizabeth von arnim s novel comes alive in this charming little film which beautifully demonstrates the virtues of a literate script and ensemble acting all the elements come together to produce a movie that although nearly forgotten now still produces a feeling of appreciation at the story s appropriate resolution the actresses each acquit themselves splendidly ann harding is the free spirited wife longing for wisteria tranquillity far from foggy london katharine alexander plays the quiet housewife wishing for the elegant responsibility of acting as hostess in the castle jane baxter is the beautiful young noblewoman temporarily escaped from her throng of male admirers jessie ralph steals every scene she s in as an old lady wanting only to be alone with her memories of the past the men in the story are also well cast as miss harding s husband frank morgan has a rather complex role as a mousy researcher who has a disturbing personality change when he becomes a successful writer reginald owen as miss alexander s spouse is marvelously pompous as a man well equipped to bore for england his hilarious attempt to take an english bath in an italian bathtub is made even funnier with the assistance of charles judels rafaela ottiano as the castle s harried servants finally ralph forbes one of the decade s finest forgotten actors is joyously eccentric as the ladies lighthearted landlord movie mavens will recognize an uncredited ethel griffies playing the proprietress of the hampstead housewives club,1
2026,anyone remember the first cky cky2k etc back when it was about making crazy cool stuff rather than watching bam margera act like a douchebag spoiled 5 year old super rock star wannabe the show used to be awesome however bam s fame and wealth has led him to believe that we now enjoy him acting childish and idiotic more than actual cool stuff that used to be in ex cky2k the acts are so repetitive there s like nothing new except annoying stupidity and rehearsed comments the only things we see is bam margera so busy showing us how much he doesn t care how much money he got or whatsoever i really got nothing much left to say except give us back cky2k cause bam suck i enjoy watching steve o knoxville etc a thousand times more,0
6614,leonard nimoy directed star trek iii which wasn t half bad maybe william shatner thought seeming as how nimoy did it he could after seeing this film he should have reversed that decision star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen t bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didn t care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards she looked like she was taking part in a granny competition if they meant to make her look sexy they were wrong she looked grotesque how this got to production or even written well it dosen t bear thinking about the only place good for this film is in the garbage the worst one of the series,0
20515,tim burton is in essence an expressionist film maker disinterested in dimensions of character and obsessed with gothic scope opting for style over substance incessantly throughout his career however with his style being so poignantly endearing i like many moviegoers forgive all the countless flaws that can be found in many of his movies and become engrossed in what are essentially one hundred million dollar art films it s almost embarrassing for me to see a poetic emotionally involving spirit within the second installment of a mediocre franchise especially when that franchises target audience are half witted 15 year old boys batman returns should have been every bit as commercial as its predecessor ensuring box office draw and cheap in actual fact very expensive thrills being entertaining without ever truly involving its audience had this been the result then tim burton would have surely been required to direct a third installment instead burton delivers something that can only truly be defined by the phrase out there from the melancholy opening in which a high society couple throw a prison like bassinette containing their newly born deformed baby into a river it is clear that batman returns ain t no picnic at buckingham palace cut to thirty three years later during a political speech made by bad guy business tycoon max shreck sinisterly portrayed by christopher walken the red triangle circus gang attack gotham city batman michael keaton returning to the role makes his first appearance sporting a new logo eventually saving the day shreck is soon kidnapped by the circus gang and black mailed into endorsing the political return of the baby now a fully grown penguin man danny devito in hideously perfect make up whose motives for return are suspicious only to batman meanwhile shreck attempts to off his nosey and awkward assistant selina kyle played perfectly by michelle pfeiffer who quite frankly deserved more recognition for her performance who transforms into the deliciously sexy and psychotic catwoman out for revenge and harbours for some unexplained reason a deadly vendetta against the dark knight batman returns is bleak the production design is breathtaking delivering a cold haunting gotham city with an even more apocalyptic feel than its predecessor danny elfman s score supports the film brilliantly ranging from invigorating to tragic the tone and direction of the whole film itself is intensely brooding shot like a sad nightmare burton s direction overshadows what is in fairness a diabolical screenplay with an almost totally irrelevant plot and yet at the same time perfect for burton s visual style of film making and whilst burton s action sequences struggle for exhilaration the real excitement lies in the directional choices displaying the fall of each of its main characters the penguins demise the catwoman s mental state and bruce wayne s lonely destiny warner brothers hated it whilst critical and audience reaction was mixed after all they wanted a batman sequel not a weird somewhat ghastly horror movie in which a deformed psychopathic orphan attempts to kidnap and drown a batch of babies all the while vomiting what can only be described as green mucus the production company wanted an audience friendly feature something for the mcdonald s clan to promote their happy meals with not a movie of dire irredeemable characters including a sexually repressed secretary who is pushed from a skyscraper and revived by a gang of cats awakening her from unconsciousness by chewing on her bloodied ice cold fingers it s easy to understand the mass disappointment that followed the release of batman returns the film never felt like a batman blockbuster it is questionable if burton really knew who batman actually was or even if he cared about the character as much as he cared about the film fitting in with his usual themes of beautifully haunting art direction and misinterpreted lonely characters who rarely conform with societies standards and expectations this is why burton failed to create a great batman film he did however create a nostalgic and stunning ballsy piece of cinema that remains a personal and nostalgic favourite of mine this may not be a great batman movie but it is a great tim burton film,1

24159,after seeing the trailer it was an easy decision not to see this film i mean i don t care for stupid stoner comedies i m sure it was also an easy choice for a lot of people to get together smoke a bowl and go check out this flick with the guy from the simpsons and some guy named billy bob should have been a good time but the film s just not that funny too bad somebody had to go and bum their high unfortunately i found out that the trailer was misleading after it had already left the theaters so i had to wait for the video i really enjoyed it nice locations quality production and excellent performances from the entire cast looking back at it the plot twists weren t totally unexpected but i didn t find it cumbersome because the premise was so engaging so why was this absorbing drama marketed as a comedy did something happen to the producer leaving the associate producers to do the marketing by themselves,1
7721,the very first time i saw this i recoiled in horror at what was being presented as modern liberated women sorry but i cannot relate to whining idiots whose lives revolve around loveless sex and the acquisition of gucci prada and louis vuitton labels the troubling thing is that some may actually think this is how career women live in nyc it s definitely not these women are incredibly shallow and materialistic and as another reviewer said they act like gold digging hooches this is not liberated womanhood and i m glad it s gone 0 stars and just plain awful,0
19293,this movie was fun if all over the board it essentially follows the comedic romp of two grave robbers in 19th century england who move from conventional body snatching to trafficking in vampires zombies and dead roswell aliens i have no idea what the roswell alien was doing in there and neither did the producers i think but was it funny you bet even ron perlman who is often the kiss of direct to dvd death was pretty good in this one as a priest who turns out to be the ringleader of a rival gang of body snatchers a real joy to watch this hilarious little film and a good example of what you can do when you don t have larger than life egos on either side of the camera,1
5311,i m a fan of get shorty this is the sequel for the movie that needed no sequel chili is back but rene russo is gone without a peep unfortunately chili s game was played out in the first movie and rather than find an interesting personal arc for him they just have him stand around repeating lines from the first movie it s pretty tepid travolta looks old here it s like they move people around him because his bones are getting creaky his pink lip gloss and the blue eye contacts are very weird the 2nd bad role is edie played by uma thurman she s a music producer a role that requires her only to be the female reuben kincaid hey these kids have a great new sound in any scene she strikes the wrong pitch motivationally or emotionally or both it s painful to watch despite it s plentiful problems be cool gets better after a very unpromising start i certainly got my laughs out of it vince vaughan running around on fire cedric the entertainer ludicrous the rock a t shirt that says widow on it but it offers no great memories after it s over it s a helium light love fest from the first frame there s no one as pricelessly idiotic as gene hackman in the first movie it s just about doing good in the world for a couple of kids who deserve a chance beyonce the rock ho hum the first one wasn t preachy working in repeatedly gags lines from the first movie is annoying as is the dumb concession to the rock s wrestling fans he raises his eyebrow twice as are the droll inside jokes steven tyler saying i m not the kind of singer that make appearances in movies ar ar the all star spectacular line up is part of the problem the first movie wasn t burdened by stars for a buck rental let s call it even,0
9874,this has got to be the most god awful piece of cinematic crap i have ever watched it makes mel brooks movies oscar worthy by comparison jim vanbebber needs to be publicly slapped for trying to pass this off as any form of entertainment while some may say that this movie is true to the low budget genre of such classics as the texas chainsaw massacre or night of the living dead the production value is not in question it is vanbebber s ability to cast and present a plausible story line the casting is deplorable for the role of charlie he must have picked the first actor he saw with a beard and long hair never mind that this actor s hair came halfway down his back manson s never went much past his shoulders this actor spoke in a dreadful monotone without so much as a fraction of the personality that steve railsback or even jeremy davies lent to their portrayals of manson the actor chosen to play tex watson had curly blond hair instead of straight dark hair a fact that anyone who has shown even the most remote interest in the manson case knows he looks like a minnesota farmer on little house on the prairie the actress playing susan atkins has a butt wider than oprah s while those familiar with the family members know that clem was considered somewhat retarded the actor portraying him did so in such a campy chaplinesque way it was like watching an old vaudevile act instead of sharon tate looking like a beautiful pregnant woman the actress looked like bloated alcoholic trailer trash vanbebber speeds up the filming in some places for artistic effect yet this technique hasn t proved remotely useful since the munsters the end credits list every known family member yet we are never introduced to the majority of them and those we are introduced to we aren t sure who they are sometimes facts are destroyed in this movie as well lotsapoppa did not die in real life steven parent was shot four times not twice abagail folger did not have her throat slit where were mary brunner and bruce davis during the himnan murder patricia krenwinkel never sported a dorothy hamill hair style the most baffling aspect of this movie is what the modern day freaks had to do with this movie why was the girl wearing a rubber mask with a dildo attached what was their problem with the journalist what was the meaning or purpose of the final confrontation why were they included period the viewer never knows holy mackerel i could go on and on but space prevents it don t try to eat popcorn during this garbage because your hand will be too busy scratching your head while you repeatedly say what the f,0
14863,dead or alive final the movie that supposedly brings together the three films in the very loose dead or alive trilogy and connected mostly by its stars riki takeiuchi and sho aikawa and that each film has its share of bizarro world fixtures and neuroses and heaps of violence is admittedly the weakest of the lot that none of the three films ends up being a disappointment is less a testament to the creativity of the material but to the pound for pound guts that director takashi miike takes with the surroundings and the material here he presents an overtly dystopian future however low key where a homosexual mayor dictator richard chen has the entire village drugged except for a group of rebels there s also replicants robots in this year of 2346 one of them is ryo aikawa a robot of complete lethal skill but also with the capacity to love and learn and so forth then a cop takeshi takeiuchi happens to be the mayor s top guard but things start to unravel on both sides ryo teaming up with the rebels and takeshi with his employer though blood soaked mishaps like a hostage trade off gone bad and with takeshi finding out his wife and son are robots not done in an alien mood mind you just suddenly as if in a the power went out and that he himself is one as well and it all leads up to one last inexplicable showdown between the two men strange that there s yet another film where miike has peaks and valleys here sometimes finding that middle ground of success where science fiction can have some meaning to it but there really isn t anything to take from this story except that the mayor dictator is a dingbat with no back story who gets his rocks off making sure his drug stops couples from getting pregnant and that everything remains under control he also has along with him his love slave i d guess in the hilarious non speaking part of a saxophone player who also doubles sometimes as a human fixture when not plugging away the moody blues meanwhile we get the conventional sides to ryo and takeshi s stories and they re never uninteresting just not totally convincing enough to hold interest of course miike isn t above having some fun like when takeshi plops michelle maria chen in to the water to get her to swim after a near assassination attempt on the mayor or in having the original rebel leader speaking english for no good reason at all there s even a playful homage to old sci fi cartoons at the start of the film but there s nothing very compelling substance wise with the exception of takeshi s minor turns at becoming good midway through the film helping one couple get by with clearance to have a kid and mostly miike s strengths this time are purely stylistically and in the choice of locations and sets it s like a grungy japanese alphaville where everything still has a contemporary feel through all of the special effects and i really liked the yellow green tint miike used through the movie as it impacted very well in outdoor scenes and added just enough grittiness in the indoor scenes but as for peaks and valleys one sees this ever more clearly and the sci fi movie channel level of visual effects with maybe a few more dollars put into it during the climax this contains some of the funniest material in the most delirious freudian sensibility from the director even if it has to get started by unbearable contrivance the way that ryo and takeshi finally meet up is sort of random and just a means for the producers to try and cheaply tie together the past two films when it wasn t needed on the other hand in terms of the sheer guilty entertainment value of a flick like miike s where one sees something totally unexpected and very crudely sexual it ranks right up there with the best scenes in happiness of the katakuris and visitor q overall dead or alive final is a cheesy 90 minute effort that doesn t take itself too seriously and is better off all the more for its wicked contrivances militaristic decay and cultural hang ups put on pulp level display,1
13982,this is a very strange series with dean learner i really didn t understand the guests i knew they weren t serious but whether they were really them was unclear because i guess i m just that stupid i don t know if this classes as a spoiler but the guests aren t real like in ali g or anything they re played by one man or so i believe i love the serious look that he s got going on its like that programme that was on on a sunday morning that i forget the name of lol i also really like the suit and moustache thing he has got going on its quite hot he s insensitive which is one of the funniest qualities i also like the way he has subsections of the programme it makes it seem more authentic,1
15860,i was unsure of this movie before renting and did so on the assurance that hilary swank has always given excellent performances in her movies she seems to rely on restraint to gain the emotional impact that she does and she didn t prove me wrong in this movie however the movie also had fantastic performances from all other members of the cast both speaking and non speaking i have to single out jamie bartlett and chiwetel ejiofor the two main protagonists for their outstanding acting abilities and portrayal of true human feelings and failings the whole movie ran almost like a documentary i must applaud tom hooper as the director and avril beukes as the editor for keeping a multiple layered story being revealed smoothly whilst keeping dialogue and action moving along in an understandable fashion the opening sequence of the south african landscape was striking and i had to push the pause button to savour the photography why can t a movie like this ever get nominated for an international award it seems to me to hit the high rating button on all counts it was not just a film it was a true experience of life in a country coming out of apartheid a life of poverty was all around but it celebrated the dignity of the human spirit,1

14349,paul bettany did a great role as the tortured father whose favorite little girl dies tragically of disease for that he deserves all the credit however the movie was mostly about exactly that keeping the adventures of darwin as he gathered data for his theories as incomplete stories told to children and skipping completely the disputes regarding his ideas two things bothered me terribly the soundtrack with its whiny sound practically shoving sadness down the throat of the viewer and the movie trailer showing some beautiful sceneries the theological musings of him and his wife and the enthusiasm of his best friends as they prepare for a battle against blind faith thus misrepresenting the movie completely to put it bluntly if one were to remove the scenes of the movie trailer from the movie the result would be a non descript family drama about a little child dying and the hardships of her parents as a result clearly not what i expected from a movie about darwin albeit the movie was beautifully interpreted,1
6617,i don t think i can add much more to what has already been said about this film however i can offer a small recollection from seeing st v in the theater in the last dreadful scene as the camera is pulling out from the camping shot and it seems likely that the credits will start rolling at any second the audience seemed to rise in unison normally for a movie like this at least some die hard fans stay to watch right up until the final disclaimer as the people filed out i remember hearing no laughing and cheerful banter only low murmurs i remember reading a movie review in the local paper in which the critic said that it was so bad that only trek fans would like it what an idiot the fans were the ones most apt to tear it apart first favorite worst scene target shooting on a voyager space probe through a periscope no less space must be a much smaller frontier than we thought,0
8472,a lot of actors have a multitude of good movie roles in their soul some a handful others maybe a couple then there s linda blair the exorcist that s it when you see chained heat and watch linda blair in it you have to wonder what if anything was running through her mind certainly not oh boy oscar for best actress here i come just another women in prison film like they used to make for the cheap in the 70s this one actually has names you may recognize john vernon plays the dean i mean the warden with a hot tub in his office wonder what he told the contractor stella stevens pops up even henry silva and louisa moritz show how bad they needed the work and special mention of course for our heroine sybil danning as a bisexual prisoner who puts the moves on poor blair to paraphrase sybil is as sybil does and everything sybil does is done perfect makes you forget what a terrible movie you re watching almost two stars one for sybil and another for trying to pass off linda blair as a sex symbol whatever could have possessed them get it,0
5237,i registered with imdb com just so i could comment about this movie my god what a steaming pile of horse crap this was it shouldn t even be touted as a real movie this is very deceiving this is a 15 year old s film project at best the acting is terrible but even good actors could not save this the dialog is probably the worst part of this movie who the hell wrote this crap and that constant joke coming from the chubby lesbian about kaye being a damsel in distress got old real fast god i d rather have a camel take a wet dump in my ear than watch this crap again do not rent this movie if they gave you the movie for free do not watch it smash it with a hammer even if smashing this video caused you to lose your hollywood video or blockbuster video account it would be well worth it this is an abomination i suppose i have said all i can about this without being redundant any questions email me,0
4312,good attempt at tackling the unconventional topic of may december romances however the treatment is totally unrealistic sure sixty year old men can and do fall for younger women but they re usually adult women with whom they share common interests and values and viewpoints not neurotic immature near underage girls of course there are exceptions and they come close to being called pedophiles sorry rgv but it s not credible that a sane and accomplished sexagenarian would throw away a comfortable family life and become a joke to his peers all for an 18 yr old that doesn t have a practical thought in her head and that behaves like an unstable escapee from a mental institution you don t have to have a phd in psychology to see that amitabh s character is seduced by sex and that the young woman has unresolved abandonment and daddy issues as for the recurring scene of vijay perched on the edge of a cliff contemplating suicide that s about as close as he comes to having anything in common with jiah by behaving like a smitten teenage boy on a positive note the actors did a good job and cinematography good,0
22333,this was a thoughtful and well shot and directed tv movie that took on a huge subject with precision and intelligence and gives it a film treatment that would look great on a bigger screen the palette is a little muted for tv if you re looking for a war action film or bosnia lite this isn t for you it s about an ordinary woman who took on an extraordinary challenge for humanity if you want to learn more about the conflict and how the work of one woman influenced the world in a massive way watch this film when it comes your way i don t see that a lot of other tv films have dealt with the issue of genocide and ethnic hatred at this level the story avoids obvious demonization of the bad guys and instead shows the denial and everyday hatred that resulted in deaths of thousands i was moved at several points and not in some manipulative hollywood way with driving music and flashy mise en scene but allowed to discover the horror and implications along with the characters this is a film brave enough to let the content speak for itself and keep the visuals understated to support it with dignity the actors do a helluva job at bringing the intense dramatic scenes to life the scenes where victims give their testimony before the war tribunal are powerful and wendy crewson stipe erceg and heino ferch are excellent william hurt s british accent is awful no one else has given him a chance to play a brit and when he finally has it he blows it and although john corbett s body was born to play a soldier commando he s a little too gee whiz nice although he does a good job,1
23569,this is a very realistic movie it s the most realistic i ve seen on urban youth the actors were great i will look out for more films by gomez i had never heard of the film until someone mentioned it recently i bought it on dvd i was impressed i haven t seen anything come close to life as i know it in philadelphia this comes real close in fact one scene where there is an accident i won t spoil and give details reminded me of a nearly identical situation in philadelphia at first i thought gomez took the scene from that real life event but then i realized that he made the film a few years before that situation i also agree with the point that this film didn t try to broaden its appeal by putting in hollywood crap gomez also directed laws of gravity i am eager to see it,1

16550,oh i remember watching this show at 4 00 p m during my junior high days it was not a pleasant experience because i remember watching it when i made my homework still the show caught my attention when alex displayed her special powers and dealt with the typical junior high problems but the show wasn t all about adventures and special powers it was more of an educational effort for a younger audience in order to get more interested in school and biology overall the lead actress can t remember her name and i m too lazy to copy and paste from the main details delivered a fantastic performance she made the show watchable they just don t make shows like this one anymore,1
4188,what the heck is this about kelly jennifer seems to drop all moral behavior as soon as she arrives to the island she finds this juan p manuel existing and exotic though she witnessed when he slapped his ex in the face which he also justify later on in the movie right or wrong these two guys are the first to find each other on the island kelly are totally lost in every sense and the great juan p can fish and built a somewhat house mr handyman they seem to have a great time then billy zane jack kellys characters husband shows up and of course two days without knowing what his wife has been doing whit this gorgeous juan p he is a little bit jealous billy z is the stereotype rich guy and maybe not the nicest man in the world he dislikes juan p for hitting his girlfriend at the pier who can blame him hes also is arrogant but he paid loads of money to rent that boat and juan p who is the waiter everything cant even fetch him a beer whit in 20 min wouldn t you be upset yet billy is probably the guy you want to punch in the face if you meet him but at the same time he is not to be blamed for suspicious about the scuba goggles manuel has kelly and billy just lost some dear friends how convenient he just happens to have them no matter what however for some strange reason kelly likes this girl hitting manuel and starts to hate billy for being jealous ok billy is overreacting thats for sure but kelly isn t doing much to convince him either she spends more time with juan p and even wants him to sleep with them since hes been so nice and even though manuel yelled at her and calling her things for asking him some intimate questions but kelly is so forgiving yeah right and then she starts to have sex with this juan p it should be said that kelly and billy seems to have a working relationship before this island incident at least they have intimate sex on the boat and talks like people do when they like each other now you can think that this scenario is possible but for real is it are you cheating your husband after two days on a coconut island just because hes jealous and acts like a drunk in the bar i wouldn t disagree if there relationship was really bad but the director doesn t give much hints if thats the case for christ sake juan p hasn t really shown himself being a good person catching some fish and built a wood house to get into someones panties is that showing a good side not trying to befriend kellys husband in anyway which would be very simple by letting them be alone most of the island time simply be respect he doesn t care about their relationship and kelly cant figure that one out he just want to have sex with kelly kellys character is just not trustworthy if she was stranded with billy and another attractive girl wouldn t she be upset or what or maybe she is billy zane plays a not very nice person and juan p isn t actually much better if you really think about it and poor kelly is so confused and believes having sex with juan p will solve everything because her husband is so strange and so aggressive towards poor juan p so for all of you who reads this what do you think about it if you where the kelly character would you consider cheating on your husband knowing one day you ll be back in real life and all of a sudden billys maybe not that horrible person after all hes just too jealous and if you where billys character what do you say is he totally wrong in his behavior and juan p character what do you guys really think of him one thing is for sure manuels exist ps the voodoo thing is so totally wrong here what the heck was that about seriously anyone tell me,0
17991,i may differ from many people on this board but i enjoy watching mind of mencia the reason i like mind of mencia is the host is not afraid to speak his mind or exploit stereotypes carlos mencia does what we all do with our friends but are unwilling to admit and then some mencia has no problem doing jokes about any race religion sex or orientation while he gets a lot of flack for this it is a breath of fresh air in these politically correct times mencia does not care if he offends anyone but he is not a racist and even does jokes about his own race the typical format for the mind of mencia goes like this there will be an open skit making fun of a person or recent event mencia then comes out and does a 5 or 6 minute stand up where he talks about various issues the show then has 2 separate skits divided by commercials in these skits mencia does a variety of things such as making fun of people giving his personal opinions with a funny twist or simply doing parodies of people events or movies at the end of the show mencia comes out for a minute with either one final skit or something else to say people criticize mencia for exploiting stereotypes and say his statements are overly offensive carlos only does what everyone else thinks of certain races but are afraid to say as for mencia being offensive he is only speaking his mind i find nothing wrong with that the show is not perfect the skits can be not put together the best and sometimes mencia does go over the line in his jokes for the most part however it is a show where the comedian says what is on his mind no matter what the consequences and presents in in a humorous matter so if you aren t afraid to laugh at stereotypes and see someone speak his mind and often say what you have wanted to say then watch mind of mencia however if you are easily offended you should not watch this show because you will be offended or worse yet you might even laugh,1

18639,this is one of the best tv productions of a musical ever i have heard the merman cast album the angela lansbury album i have seen tyne daly live and i ve seen the rosalind russell movie countless times i think bette is if not the best then tied with the best she captures not just the bravura but also the pathos of mama rose i was never a natalie wood fan so i really enjoyed cynthia gibb in what is arguably her best role everything from the costumes to the sets to the supporting performances is wonderful the three strippers led by the always dependable christine ebersole are hard to top there was supposed to be a tv production of mame a few years back with cher but i think bette would be the best bet pun intended for auntie mame,1

6166,when jim wynorski first announced he would be doing a new sequel for my favorite series of all time the slumber party massacre series i was ecstatic i had been waiting for a new installment for literally years so production began and very small bits and pieces on the shoot and the actors involved were released until the shoot wrapped then the announcement of a title change no longer would this new sequel be titled slumber party massacre iv but cheerleader massacre instead i was a bit disappointed but having a different title would be a very small price to pay for a film i had waited so long to happen i was still extremely intrigued and on the edge of my seat to see it maybe a month ago some very advanced copies of the film were released to some extremely lucky viewers who got to see the film months before its release date a few reviews leaked on the net and judging by them i began to become apprehensive on jim wynorski s cheerleader massacre tonight i got to see the film for the first time in full length and i am still scratching my head as i read in another review cheerleader massacre is definitely not a new installment in the slumber party massacre series but a slasher flick all on its own and a bad one at that before i get into the specifics of the film let me first state what an enormous fan of jim wynorski s films i am i always thought him to be a true camp genius with a winner almost every time yes his movies are made on shoestring budgets and don t contain the most top notch acting around but they re fun nonetheless they are what they are campy movies you watch when you want to have a good time from sorority house massacre ii to hard to die to chopping mall jim has produced the goods on more than one occasion one of the reasons why i was excited that this film would be his latest project cheerleader massacre does not in my opinion reflect any of the films i had seen this director writer create in the past firstly the production was extremely inexpensive and the film was actually shot on videotape something i had never seen jim do before the actors were mediocre to say the least and the story is almost laughable the killer is also extremely stupid and reminds you more of your cuddly old grandpa rather than an escaped lunatic of course the film is littered with female nudity this is a jim wynorski movie we re talking about folks but some of the boob shots seen here almost seem like they were done for time there is an extremely long shower scene containing the cheerleading coach that seems to go on forever and it greatly reflects a shower scene in jim s sorority house massacre ii the girl even bathes herself almost in the exact same way cheerleader massacre is also extremely cliched to say the least the opening scene is literally something we ve all seen in hundreds of past slasher flicks a guy and a girl making out on the verge of consummating their relationship when you guessed it they re hacked to pieces brinke stevens who i ve never really considered to be a tremendous actress in the first place also gives one of her stiffest and forced performances in her small cameo we re talkin possible cue cards here she recalls some incidents her character endured by the killer seen here twenty years ago to the police while footage of the original slumber party massacre plays why was footage from the original film used if it was definitely not a new spm i have no idea there is also two explosions seen in this movie that i am almost certain were recycled from other films not only does this film recycle footage from past films but it also recycles the scores from other films as well some of the music used in humanoids from the deep which was also recycled prior for the coroner can be heard throughout the entire film there are at least two more as well that i cannot identify but am certain have been used before after sitting through this film s horrendous acting ridiculous story non existent gore special effects and camcorder like quality i am having some serious concerns toward mister wynorski s career has the man who delighted audiences with films in the past finally lost his niche only time will tell oh and let s not forget his newest film a new installment in the sorority house massacre films now titled final exam i think i m seeing a pattern here,0
11080,this must be one of the worse movies that i have ever seen on a par with blair witch and just as annoying the flashing helmet lights made things difficult to see and i think that epileptics should take heed as there are moments with strobing that makes this movie even more annoying i think if they had been quieter they might have found a way out then when you think the geek might come up trumps even he resorts to a nervous breakdown oh and when is the guy who is having sex realise that when the girl says she can hear something she can really hear something one of these guys must have at least seen scream where they draw your attention to such things it is also a big let down when a premise offers so much promise and then someone writes the script so sorry folks i got this on weekly at the video shop and i would still like my money back,0
21575,it s possible to have a good time with this film while at the same time regretting all that it isn t in the 1980s a raffish u s congressman tom hanks engineers support for afghan partisans resisting the soviet union hanks is in breezy hail fellow well met form as roguish politically incorrect charlie wilson first glimpsed sharing a hot tub with three deeply available looking women if only the film had the same air of insouciance but apart from philip seymour hoffman s turn as a cynical cia agent it tries to be perceived as patriotic too aaron sorkin s trademark staccato dialogue serves its purpose but the story is no more plausible than one of wilson s tall tales and there s an oddly unspoken subtext wilson s afghan pals later mutated into the taliban and other anti western groups leaving the world worse off than it was when these events occurred,1
21785,i was very excited to see a documentary on one of my favorite italian directors d amato has dabbled in everything from horror post apocalyptic to hardcore porn he has touched upon genius a couple of times with films like buio omega and emmanuelle the last cannibals this documentary is a lenghty and informative guide to the films of d amato he is interviewed throughout with english subtitles rolling across the bottom of the screen the excerpts from his films are narrated by a narrator with english subtitles the documentary proved extra interesting when it analyzed the often censored emmanuelle in america here d amato explaines the faked snuff scenes in detail and recalls some funny stories in fact good ol joe is very warm and funny throughout always wearing a smile and smoking a cigarette the one disapointing aspect of this documentary is that it spends little time on d amato s horror films like anthropophagus and the brilliant buio omega it spends too much time on the erotic cinema and hardly touches the post apocaplyptic films but i can t complain it is wonderful to see d amato get the respect he deserves highly recommended for fans of d amato may he rest in peace,1
19676,i absolutely loved this movie it s my number one favorite although there were a few flaws what movie doesn t have flaws this movie was very well written directed and produced the characters in this movie are very real and believable they made all of the characters fit into a specific role i think that the most apparent thing about here on earth was the love triangle as well as the other emotional situations brought into the movie it s not one of those movies where you just can t seem to relate to anything because in it are situations that everyone is or has been in there are so many different things going on in this movie that it is hard not to relate to it i am just 18 years old and i can even relate to it it was heart warming and wrenching at the same time here on earth will make you laugh cry and sometimes angry i give this movie an excellent review and recommend it to anyone who loves romance and passion,1
17365,comanche moon had everything going for it for starters simon wincer s back a man who s name is synonymous with high quality tv westerns unfortunately the problems with moon are something even the most talented director couldn t solve a poor script based on a lackluster novel forget historical accuracies as any reader of the novels can tell you the biggest travesty in moon is that it s not even consistent with information from the original lonesome dove masterpiece so many wonderful rich moments in the miniseries and to an even greater degree the book are completely missing in moon considering the fact that most viewers of moon are probably coming with at least some sort of dove background the lack of character driven and emotional backstory is downright painful that said moon is one instance where the adapted version could and should have been altered to make it more suitable for the screen for example the novel moon focuses largely on the comanches themselves to its credit the miniseries tries to service the comanches but in the end it gives them just enough that the viewer just gets a sense they re missing out on some important part of the story similarly val kilmer s scull loses out here too the role should have either been expanded so kilmer and rachel griffiths for that matter actually had something to do or the roles should have just been reduced to smaller supporting parts instead kilmer gets top billing for a character that just leaves you scratching your head after his appearance in the completely bizarre final act there s strange moments throughout the film that just make no sense to those who haven t read the book a killer parrot what further there isn t a single scene that shows us that call and mccrae are anything near the amazing texas rangers they claim to be not a single one of their expeditions in moon or dead man s walk for that matter ends successfully and call and mccrae just seem to blunder their way through one pointless mission after another frankly larry mcmurtry should never have been given the job of writing the script and only did so because of the praise surrounding that other cowboy movie brokeback mountain mcmurtry can write good novels although there s some dissension over the consistency of that statement but he s never exactly established himself as a scriptwriter this production would have benefited from not only bringing back director wincer but original screenwriter bill wittcliff to adapt the novel to screen witcliff doesn t exactly have a mountainload of material to his screen writing credit but no one can deny he did a fantastic job at whittling down the original lonesome dove with all this said comanche moon is almost a brilliant production aided by a terrific cast that unfortunately just aren t given enough to do steve zahn s portrayal of gus mccrae or rather his portrayal of robert duvall as gus mccrae is dead on and while some have criticized karl urban as woodrow call saying his performance doesn t imitate the quiet stoic woodrow of the original movie all i can say is blame mcmurtry because mcmurtry is the one who both in the moon novel and now the miniseries turned woodrow from socially inept awkward but natural leader into some emotionless character whose lines are just dull and whose character motivations are only clear if you ve seen them portrayed far more adequately in the sequel still it s the cast that sparkles in moon to the degree that i left the miniseries with that same feeling of melancholy i felt watching the original lonesome dove this time because i realized it s probably the last time we ll see these characters appear on screen for a long long time to come and quite honestly this cast could have done so well in a well nurtured full blown network tv series all in all aside from wasted opportunities with the cast the biggest travesty is that the original lonesome dove novel contained so much rich backstory for the characters that would have been fascinating utterly fascinating to see translated on screen unfortunately all that has been tossed aside in favor of mcmurtry s tedious inconsistent and ultimately irrelevant prequel,1
19096,before i d seen this movie i ve heard a lot of praise about it and quite many exclamations about how horrific it was not to take any credit away from this movie i think it wasn t all that horrible or even shocking it s just a movie about people living in the darker side of the town and a good one at portraying the point there s some great acting here and a well thought of manuscript paavo westerberg is a renowned writer in the finnish movie scene and he s the best in what comes to describing the contemporary finnish culture albeit he s not the only one writer for this movie but i dare say he s the main writer anyway correct me if i m wrong the casting is excellent except for jasper p kk nen the pseudo main character who in my opinion should have stayed in the soap opera scene and the sets the cuts and sounds are very well done as well and give great atmosphere to this movie this movie is a story about loosely interconnected sad destinies that according to a famous finnish band s very well known song eppu normaali s tuhansien murheellisten laulujen maa which very roughly translated to paha maa throughout the whole finnish society lead to a sad dark end accompanied with booze lonesomeness and the bad choices and it s the side of everyday finnish life about 80 of the population have no awareness of unless movies like this are made,1
2557,i think this was a horrible mistake on disney s part first off kuzco does not need to pass emperor school to become emperor that s never happened before secondly the new voices don t sound like the originals at all very poor redo and while i adored the movie the emperor s new groove the new school is just stupid like all the jokes are the same and many are from the movie the plot gets redundant always yzma is that how you spell it trying to become empress kuzco stopping her etc or kuzco learning to become a better person i think kuzco gets annoying with his constant complaints and questions he is a spoiled brat and it bothers me i do not think this is worth five minutes of your time much less a half hour,0
22137,jackass number two is easily the most hilarious film of 2006 beating the also hilarious clerks ii it is one of the best sequels in recent memory beating jackass the movie in every way now this film may be the funniest but it is also the most offensive appalling and utterly disgusting you will find yourself feeling sick several times throughout the film i m completely serious when i say don t eat anything before watching or during this film because chances are that it will literally come back to haunt you keep the drinking to a minimum as well you ve been warned because just like the tagline says it will make you beg for mercy jackass number two follows the crazy men from the hit show jackass johnny knoxville bam margera ryan dunn steve o chris party boy pontius preston lacy ehren mcghehey dave england brandon dicamillo and jason wee man acuna chris raab himself raab is absent as they perform the most outrageous life threatening and revolting stunts imaginable i m not going to tell what the stunts are but i will warn you that any scene with an animal will be sickening or psychologically frightening and that one cast member once again not telling will flirt with death several times in the film what makes jackass number two so entertaining is not the stunts themselves but how the cast reacts to them and to doing them to put it simple if they loved doing it and had a blast you will too this goes for 99 of the stunts all the stunts are very original and 90 of them are never before seen you will witness a few recycled ones but they re amped up you wouldn t think directing really factors into a movie like this but it does jeff tremaine s direction makes the movie so much funnier because he provides guidance for the gang in their comedic timing which is simply brilliant on his part he could have just sat back and slept throughout filming actually you ll see in the film that he did sleep through some filming but he went out there and helped these crazy guys make the stunts as funny as he could i give mr tremaine two thumbs up for that another great thing about jackass is its bonanza of celebrity cameos and this time they include bmx legend mat hoffman skateboard god tony hawk director actor jay chandrasekhar super troopers beerfest actor luke wilson miami dolphins star jason taylor and director actor mike judge office space the scenes with hoffman taylor and chandrasekhar are among the funniest in the film as it s even funnier to see these men as a part of the film jackass number two is one of the most politically incorrect morally degrading and just plain wrong movies of all time if not the most despite this it is so original and so hilarious that you won t care about that you ll be gasping for air laughing so hard you ll be crying and jumping out of your seat laughing throughout the entire film due to the explicit and potentially disturbing graphic content of this film no one under 18 should watch this film you ve been warned i hope you enjoy jackass number two as much as i did 10 10 spy,1
14424,i was happy to find out that at least now this movie is beginning to get the appreciation it deserves just view those votes not top class action like die hard or lethal weapon but still something like a solid 7 out of 10 fine script good actors with working chemistry and a director who knows what he wants sadly this was director harlin s last good film deep blue sea managed to reach an ok rollercoaster ride status but cutthroat island and especially driven are well deserved flops personally i think the turn off at the box office might have been the woman as an action star theme well give her a chance because davis does deliver a performance above par and after all this film doesn t concentrate so much on the feminine side but instead on good ol action buddyism jackson as a sidekick is given a lot of room in here plus his share of action and about a thousand killer wisecracks and on the plot from shane black the writer of lethal weapon and the last boy scout the latter of which as a movie is on very many levels much like this one the theme the clever plot also as good and as underrated overall if one hasn t seen this one yet don t forget to rent it for the next quiet saturday night,1
12992,another nice entry in the crime doctor series 4 10 with atmospheric almost noirish black and white photography and some splendid spanish american backdrops and sets and a more off the wall storyline too a man who looks like the insane murderer of his first two wives is found dead in a locked room after a dramatic dinner party the crime doctor is on the scene ostensibly as a guest to immediately and resignedly proclaim it murder and so we are presented with a quite weird set of people to mull over for one of them did the deed was it the frothing brother of the dead 1st wife the 3rd wife and rich widow hilary brooke the dancing brother and sister vampires the intense young man the eccentric cabinet maker lloyd corrigan on loan from boston blackie the irreplaceable butler or odds on jerome cowan police inspector emory parnell had his work cut out but warner baxter as ordway was as unflappable as ever in working it all out one of the goofs listed on the imdb is wrong on breaking into the murder room ordway says right through the centre of the forehead and cowan replies he didn t miss this time favorite bits baxter and cowan travelling through club sandwiches and beer at the nightclub to make amends for their interrupted dinner party the scene where the braga s place of repose is seemingly rumbled the plot does seem to meander a bit at times and the way it was all explained off was perhaps more worthy of monogram but leaving it in the air as supernatural wouldn t do either well worth a watch if you already like the genre you won t be disappointed unless you really don t like the genre,1
20758,delightful it never pretends to be a masterpiece but it s a mini gem of late seventies british comedy given that the producers wanted to sell it abroad it stars an american the late character actor richard jordan but at least he isn t the usual dull hollywood hunk type surrounding him is the cream of british character acting talent led by a wonderfully waspish and superior david niven niven s ivan the terrible naturally gets the best one liners and all the best reaction shots he also manages to be surprisingly menacing and intimidatingly dangerous the moment in the snooker club when he drops the charming facade and threatens richard jordan will come as a shock to those viewers who think of niven as being only a light drawing room comedy star he is filled with genuine power and ruthlessness as we see all at once how ivan earned his nickname all the more surprising given how ill niven was at the time shortly after filming this production he lost his powers of speech to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis known as lou gehrig s disease this is the last picture niven made where you can hear his own voice being dubbed thereafter by the comic impressionist sid caesar alongside him you can spot numerous familiar faces from seventies cinema and television elke sommer flashing her breasts in true seventies era politically incorrect bimbo mode oliver tobias michael angelis brian croucher davy kaye etc etc davy kaye gets one of the biggest laughs as he holds up a security guard caught making a phone call who you ringing bloody dial a disc you gormless git great shots of london street locations making the film a period patina time capsule of red phone boxes with chunky round dial manual handsets black cabs driven by cor blimey gov cockneys and ladies and gents modelling all manner of deeply dodgy late seventies retro leisure wear and hair styles unlike the classic ealing comedies of an earlier era the hero is allowed to get away with his crime and escape to a life in the sun how times had changed the morality code by which crooks in films always had to be seen to be punished had long gone by the seventies with anti heroes like pinky green earning status through their cheeky anti authoritarianism and determination to cock a snook at a stuffy capitalist establishment of be suited fat cat businessmen we are encouraged to cheer as pinky makes off unpunished and free as a bird with his ill gotten gains compare that to the ending of the lavender hill mob highly entertaining quaintly dated in its fashions and attitudes and the stuff of late night cult viewing perfect to watch at midnight after the pubs have shut if you re of a certain age are feeling a touch nostalgic and have always wanted to see david niven in a branch of mcdonalds silently intimidating an american via the use of a retractable telescope,1
13581,one should not be too critical about the director s second feature i really like the camera work of madiba as mr shawn pointed out he had a unique way of looking at things however howcome a 14 year old boy shoot such beautiful images remember he has not got any education of any sort i don t think english is the common tongue in cape town ghettos worse still madiba looks even smaller than his supposed age of 14 any way if you overcome above mentioned peculiarities you can watch the film and still enjoy it because of nice camera work,1
2712,the movie starts off as we see a footage of a huge drought back in the 30 s in america then a short story is shown about a creepy looking farmer elija who made a deal with satan to get good harvest elija hired young men to work in his garden killed them and used as scarecrows he also fed the ground with their blood some time after 2 cops come to visit him one of them gets shot by elija another one kills the farmer himself after that the present day is shown and some guy named sean is told that he has an old farm left as inheritance he decides to go there with some friends to see what s up little did sean know that the next night is the payback night as for me this movie had a good story for a horror flick but low budget and poor special effects just ruined it dark harvest is a perfect example of lazy film making for example we see a scarecrow a usual guy wearing a funny cheap mask chasing a girl when he raises his hand we get to see a normal human skin below his glove instead of some rotting flesh the gore is not very impressive as well there are some nasty killings by our lovely scarecrows but everything is very cheap and unrealistic surprisingly the acting is somewhat ok in this flick or i better say its believable some nude scenes are presented as well for the fans even a lesbian scene but those scenes don t save it verdict good music good story solid acting but awful effects cheap gore and plot holes slow this movie down not really recommended,0
19221,danny boyle was not the first person to realise that zombies can run like the clappers that honour belongs to lifeforce which is of course the greatest naked space vampire zombies from halley s comet running amok in london end of the world movie ever made tobe hooper may have made a lot of crap but for this deliriously demented epic sci fi horror he deserves a place among the immortals plus it offers space vampire mathilda may the best thing to come out of france since simone simon spending the entire movie naked which she does very very well just bear in mind that while she is the most overwhelmingly feminine presence anyone on earth has ever encountered she s also totally alien to this planet and our life form and totally dangerous it s a pitch meeting i d have loved to have sat in on astronauts from the british space program find three naked humanoid alien life forms inside a giant 150 mile long artichoke umbrella shaped spaceship hidden in the tail of halley s comet filled with giant desiccated bats and bring them back to earth with near apocalyptic results as they proceed to drain the population of london of their lifeforce amid much nudity whirlpools of thunder and spit your coffee across the room direlogue i ve been in space for six months and she looks perfect to me assume we know nothing which is understating the matter don t worry a naked woman is not going to get out of this complex oh and we ll get the writers of alien and blue thunder to write it with uncredited rewrites by the writer of mark of the devil the sex thief and eskimo nell and the director of the jonestown monster sounds like a winner here s 22m have fun and they do they do true there s enough promise in the raw material to have made something genuinely creepy and thought provoking at a time when aids hysteria was approaching its height a sexually transmitted plague offers ample opportunity for allegory but in the hands of the go go boys at cannon what could have been another quatermass and the pit quickly turns instead to be more plan 10 from outer space it s full to bursting with delirious inanity be it frank finlay s hilarious death scene here i go peter firth s grand entrance i m colonel caine from the sas discreetly shouts michael gothard across a room full of reporters gentlemen that last remark was not for publication this is a d notice situation he replies to the surprisingly obliging pressmen the security guards offering mathilda may s naked space vampire a nice biscuit to stop her escaping reanimated bodies exploding into dust all over people the sweaty prime minister sucking the life out of his secretary and london filling up with zombie nuns stockbrokers and joggers as the city gets its most comprehensive on screen trashing since mrs gorgo lost junior at battersea funfair and went on the rampage and that s not mentioning the this woman is a masochist an extreme masochist scene or the great stereophonic echo effect on the male vampire s it ll be a lot less terrifying if you just come to me line while a lead stake wielding peter firth adopts his best action man voice to reply i ll do just that in one scene alone you have a possessed patrick stewart embodying the female in our deeply confused astronaut hero s mind steve i never got over playing charlie manson railsback and his amazing dancing eyebrows in full on helta skelta mode trying to resist the temptation to kiss him the inimitable aubrey morris the only man who makes freddie jones look restrained playing the home secretary sir percy heseltine as a kind of demented brian rix peter firth one of those actors who always looks like he must have been a doctor who around the time no one was watching it anymore hamming up the blas public school macho in the hope that no one will ever see it and the peerless reaction shots of john hallam as the male nurse who keeps on opening the door mid psychic tornado to bring in more drugs as if they needed any more in this film it s just a shame that frank finlay s mad haired scientist who isn t qualified to certify death on alien life forms a role originally intended for klaus kinski missed out on the action in that one no matter how mad you think the film is it still manages to get madder still whether it be a zombie pathologist he too needs feeding exploding all over the home secretary s suit patrick stewart s blood and entrails forming a naked mathilda may or the space vampires turning st paul s cathedral into the world s biggest laser show to transport human souls from the london underground to their geostationary mother ship i loved every gloriously insane moment in it s own truly unique way this might be the greatest film ever made the dvd offers the original 116 minute version that opened in the uk rather than the heavily edited 101 minute us version which not only offers much more hilarity for your dollar but also fully restores henry mancini s score to its original glory the us version covered a lot of the gaps with additional cues by michael kamen and james guthrie although a somewhat surprising choice at first sight mancini cut his teeth on many of the classic universal sci fi horrors of the 50s and his score is quite superb with a terrific driving main title that offers a rare reminder of just how interesting he could be away from blake edwards sadly there s no more than a trailer by way of extras though it would be nice to hope some day for a special edition with some of the deleted scenes from hooper s originally intended 128 minute cut from what s on display here these might just offer even more comedy gold,1
22235,i mention that there may be a spoiler here just to be cautious because of what i discuss although i don t really think i am giving away anything important any suprises are really unimportant to this film s success or a viewer s ability to enjoy it while not without some very minor flaws this is a beautiful and very moving film about friendship time uncertainty and the choices people make about their lives yet at the same time it is also a very humorous film with small mostly understated bits of comedy woven in throughout for much of the film it progresses at a fairly leisurely pace but it does not seem slow at all since the film draws one into it and into the lives of the characters and at first it is mostly rather light hearted some have commented that much of the film seems slow but it is such a wonderful portrayal of the lives of such sympathetic characters that one could watch it almost endlessly as it progresses the film becomes more emotional and moving up to the very end and the progression is handled wonderfully eventually some of the characters decide to rob a bank and although it is perhaps somewhat hard to believe that is beside the point it is a wonderful addition to emphasise the love that these friends have for each other while at the same time it accents the humour and adds a little more irony to the film and although hardly original to have a bunch of old guys rob a bank the context and details are quite original and they do it wonderfully making it really quite funny as well such as when ismet if i remember correctly exaggerates his aggressiveness to disguise the fact he s old as i said most of the other comedy is rather low key but still very humorous so i was constantly chuckling throughout the actors are probably the real key to this film they imbue the characters with deep personality and sympathy and portray them with great care and warmth there are some small transformations or tiny details of the characters personalities which are pulled off smoothly and beautifully of course the film is about the personalities of these very characters and how they care for and interact with one another it succeeds so well because of them and if lesser actors had the roles the movie could well have failed gule gule is not without sadness but that simply provides the full range of emotions and provides a more powerful experience in fact the film is so moving and filled with so much love from such rich characters that it is in the end a very heart warming satisfying and even happy film despite its sadness i could watch it over and over,1
16074,this is an incredible piece of drama and powerful which hits you i found the film was great and getting to grips with the two main characters disability this was represented in a great performance by both two michael and rory whether the story is based around a true story i feel the story was trying to giving the audience a message that as a whole the general public should respect and feel for the needs of disabled people and that they should be given the same chance as any other human on the whole this film reach into my soul and i too felt touched by the actors and the director sending out there creativity the whole picture is that some actors take it beyond their character the play and only show part of the character that is believable to the audience but i feel that theses two certainly made great use as their gifted talent to portray a masterpiece piece of drama certainly one not to be missed,1
18849,a variation of the same plot line was used in a simon simon episode thin air that originally aired in dec 1982 the gender of the victim was changed the surviving spouse is one of rick s old flames it s also interesting to note that gerald mcraney had a role in this rockford file episode both episodes were based on a story by howard browne as noted in the list of writing credits anthony james plays one of his classic tv bad guy roles the continuation of the concept between the rockford files to magnum pi to simon simon quite interesting,1
19005,i was very impressed with with this film which was directed by luigi bazzoni the story was about a young woman translator who suddenly has lost all memory of the last three days and has suffered nightmares about astronauts on the moon she can not explained how this has happened to anyone one day a postcard arrives for her from the island of garma where she goes to visit strangely though people seem to know her even though she has never been there before also her dreams of astronauts on the moon come back to her i thought that this was a very strange italian movie that seemed very haunting at times and there was also strange images in the film that seemed to stay with you throughout the the time you were watching the film i would recommend this film to people just to see how good it is highly recommended,1
10478,as the metaphoric flies fled this steaming watery stool of a film i found myself longing to join them from the opening sentences you quickly gather that the actors are talentless the script editor was probably dead and the director should be to be honest i didn t manage to finish this film because about twenty dismal minutes in the sight of the main actress scuttling across the floor like a shetland pony that has been shot in the ass was too much for me to stomach i have never and i mean never seen a film as sweaty as this one and i watch tons of crap films turd,0

20506,i ve enjoyed this movie ever since i was a kid and i still do i also liked batman forever back then but the real difference is that this movie didn t date when i grew up i did notice a few scenes in this film that didn t make any sense like hhmm the crowd is angry hey where did they get those tomatoes from then i thought who cares this movie is not 100 serious anyway the original tim burton batman was great as well but it was a bit cheesy at some parts and i didn t like all the actors this movie improved on almost every aspect with a wonderful cast a more gothic style and no involvement of prince nowadays many fans of the christopher nolan movies dislike burton claiming that the nolan movies are more serious and therefore more loyal to the comics i don t think this is entirely true there has never been an adaptation of the original concept of batman which was a vengeful criminal killer with a gun batman has taken many forms over the years peeking its silliness in the 60 s and a bit with batman robin a director is free to choose what kind of batman he s going to portray as long if it s good my opinion batman doesn t necessarily have to be serious it s about a man in a rubber suit with pointy ears burton managed to create a perfect balance between the silliness and the darkness surrounding the whole idea i just recently watched the nolan movies and i love those ones as well especially the dark knight there s simply something about this movie that interests me more nolan s goal was to give the character much more depth and in doing so he looked for an explanation of nearly every aspect of batman that s a bit too much for me i m a bigger fan of the more abstract version of batman the burton movies are more theatrical and centered around the atmosphere my conclusion is that you shouldn t compare the nolan with the burton movies they re just different and it s up to you to decide which one you like better my respect is for both directors,1
5919,it starts out looking like it may be going somewhere then quickly leads the main characters into a three ring circus of remarkable stupidity which permanently destroys any likability of the characters i m a huge collector of stoner movies but this is something i would not consider a valid addition bong water is trash from the very deepest regions of the dumpster and i wouldn t be caught dead with this on my shelf i m actually convinced this movie was created by a partnership for a drug free america if you re a jack black fan then i would say that you may think 5 minutes of the movies is ok because jack black continues his legacy of singing songs for retards i really can t say enough bad things about this movie,0
24116,leos carax has made 3 great movies boys meet girls mauvais sang les amants du pont neuf in fact those films were not that great but it has the violence of youth the beauty of juvenile wilderness carax in these three movies was well aware of what cinema was but he tried to make his own vision of the art without thinking about about all he have seen but using it and melting it into his times pola x is a very different movie because carax made les amants du pont neuf a monstruosity of 20 millions dollars a film that has destroyed everything on its way after such a movie you can t do another one in the same point of view so leos carax has to changed and he did the movie isn t as beautiful as its first it s more reasonable no more studio no more dreamed paris carax has entered at last reality it s not clean anymore it s not poetic characters carax have become a romantic in the german sense of it,1
14145,i too saw this film at a film festival but unlike the previous poster i found it both interesting and original in a sea of terrible features shorts are often twice as bad do to small budgets and poor acting a w o l however is a taut little thriller that hearkens back to the outer limits the performances are solid not that one would expect otherwise from morse or mcginley and the directing is sharp and on the money i personally find it difficult to reconcile the previous poster s comments with the film i saw a w o l is quite aptly written by shane black who as is usually the case plays with the genre both paying homage to the stories pulp sensibilities while simultaneously winking at the audience and never taking itself too seriously all in all a w o l proves to be an extremely well executed and fun film,1
4206,man i went to this movie because of the great preview it looked like it had a great story and nice special effects boy was i wrong i wanted to walk out of the theater because of those horrible special effects a cartoon dino of cart board would do even a better job then this the story was fine if it would have been taken on by a big movie producer who would trow in some more money to make the effect more life like the only thing i liked about this movie where the plants that pop up everywhere even worse where the cars in one scene 2 characters walk along the street if you watch those cars you ll see the following taxi car motorcycle tri pod big bus and about 4x in a row and then there is the butterfly death that would set the whole evolution changes in to progress if that guy didn t step on the butterfly the next dino would have eaten it anyway so that s absolute bull then if you change something in the past the future will be different in the same instant not in those time waves they made but hey if the future changed in a split second the movie would be even worse but more realistic though this is just one of those movies you should see when you want to have a great laugh i spend way to much money on this movie in the theater and then they tell me this movie had 80 million dollar budget where did all that money go,0
22314,apparently this australian film based on nevil shute s novel exists in more than one form beware heavily cut versions sometimes shown on cable or satellite running anywhere from 95 minutes to 2 hours only the full 5 hour miniseries version tells the story properly it is a very close realisation of the story suffering only from editorial faults commonly found in tv movies choppiness and episodic progression but this excellent cast carries the story forward very well with generally good production values accompanying their work yuki shimoda is notable as gunso mifune one of the guards assigned to accompany the women on their agonising trek in the end he becomes a friend you will agonise with him when his loss of face leads him into death helen morse as jean paget pretty but not a great beauty she resembles sigourney weaver a bit registers just the right amount of spunk and winsomeness as the occasion demands the miniseries properly emphasises the beautiful love stories three of them joe and jean noel and jean and jean and willstown gordon jackson plays noel strachan appealingly but as a somewhat younger man than nevil shute indicated in the novel the third love affair i mentioned doesn t get quite the emphasis it is due and the full significance of the title is diminished jean is devoted to the goal of bringing businesses to willstown that will attract young women and girls and their civilising influence to this god forsaken out back town she wants to make it a town like alice alice springs that is we get only a few hints of this in several scenes if you have the five hours to spare this miniseries is a truly rewarding experience nevil shute based his novel about the cruelty of the japanese military in shunting a large group of women and children from one place to another on the maylay peninsula on a true occurrence it happened on sumatra according to shute though rather than on the peninsula the crucifixion of joe by a japanese officer for stealing chickens to feed the women is probably fiction but the cruelty of the japanese in dealing with prisoners is certainly a matter of record,1
6293,comedy works best when it relates to stuff that s true but even as such some effort is required to make jokes that everyone likes and even the most grumpy of viewers can crack a smile when i look at the daily show i see the whole it s funny because it s true thing but i don t however see the effort and often times i don t if they re being funny or just trying to make a point i notice this mostly in the interview segments the daily show started off as a news parody by definition they poke fun at how the media plays it s own news by pretending to be inept and dumb news reporters and anchormen and they tackled tons of subjects from science to movies and sometimes politics then jon stewart came along and it all went to hell thr first years of jon stewart s reign were arguably golden i though he was so funny but then 2004 came along and it s where you start to notice a huge chance in the show from there on the show s humor has gone stale colbert left steve carell left many of the show s best anchors left and now it s mostly about jon stewart and the show s gone from a parody to a semi serious news show essentially evening news but with some gags here and there for those who haven t seen the show and are having trouble finding out what to watch on cable i ll give you a brief description of what the show s about at least until 2009 bush cheney and all republicans unless they happen to embrace an opinion shared by democrats as well are stupid evil corrupt and hypocrites anyone who stands by conservative beliefs is also evil corrupt and a hypocrite people who doubt the man made global warming theory are evil and stupid vote democrat there i saved you 25 minutes of your time go watch something else at first i though that the producers hijacked the show for their own personal political agenda but when i actually see the interviews it becomes crystal clear what this show s about what i mentioned above but i ll get to that in a moment frist off the humor in the daily show according to jon stewart expects you to find a random filmed quote said by either bush cheney or a random republican humorous because well because jon sets up the joke setting it in writers specific context and expects that the random quote somehow delivers the punchline so unless you get the context it s entirely useless as bankable humor also the daily show expects you to laugh when they show a montage of one politician talking and in another separate video saying another thing again putting into a context that the writers expect you to understand thus making it funny why well because jon said so now imagine the daily show using that formula countless times for years every week and you ll start to understand of what used to be a laugh fest that is now 25 minutes of just silent stares yes even in the lewis black segments at first some decent amount of effort was put into these jokes but now much less of that is apparent and the interview have the most odd sense of bias that i ve ever seen jon stewart calls bill o reilly a bully but what does that make him when he sucks up to every single actor and democrat john kerry before obama today that appears on the show and looks down upon respected republicans and accomplished conservative newsmen such as weekly standard s own bill kristol he puts them in some sort of people s tribunal as if they re being charged with a crime often times any person on the show who stands up for bush is portrayed as delusional as if that person s out of touch with reality and assumes he speaks for the majority of america that s the de facto treatment for anybody conservative unless they happen to share a similar point of view with democrats if so then s it s an endless love fest but still it doesn t matter in the eyes of jon you are already wrong before you walked into the show and are still wrong afterwords that s the kind of treatment you get if you are anything remotely right wing now you have to wonder what that could possibly have anything to do with humor one wonders what ll happen if democrats win the white house,0
16645,what can i say about this movie that has not been said by all the other comments here they pretty much sum up everything the people who love it cherish it the people who hate it well they loathe it this is the movie equivalent of marmite i personally have committed every second of it to memory it is cyclical claustrophobic introspective magical and stands as being one of the most unique films ever made despite what many have stated i believe this truly is a cult movie it is a diamond in the rough just waiting to be discovered once unearthed it s fantastical psychedelic visuals and incredible soundtrack will be unforgettable which is an achievement in itself one of my friends who watched it likened it more to a musical and in many respects to those who do not fully appreciate the context in which this film is made would probably get more out of it to view head as such i was always fond of the monkees especially the t v show back when it was repeated during the 80 s my mum had recorded head for me when it was shown on t v late night as she knew i liked them i watched it a day later and it lodged in my memory until i was able to find a copy on dvd about 2 decades later what i would love now is a special edition it would be fascinating to get a greater insight into the making of this masterpiece we can only hope,1
14062,this definitely the most tension filled x files episode of the first season this episode is what i think of when i hear x files the plot is simple but exiting our main cast plus a few scientist go to investigate an alskan outpost in which it s research team appears to have killed each other it turns out a small parasite that got dug up from the ice had infected the research team the parasite attaches itself to the brain and causes paranoia and insanity soon none can tell who they can trust or who s infected or not this episode was a direct tribute to john carpenters great horror film the thing the thing is set in antarctica and a team of scientist find a destroyed outpost in which it s occupant have been killed or killed themselves an alien that had been buried in the ice for a 10000 years had been thawed out it has the abilities to imitate any life form therefore the main characters can no longer distinct friends from foes believe me the thing is one of the most exiting and tension filled horror movies you ll ever see if you liked the episode ice i advice you to see it or if you have only seen the thing i advice you to see ice ice is the best direct tribute homage to john carpenter s the thing i have ever seen and it lives up to it s inspiration as one of the best x files episodes i give it a 10 10,1
16927,thank goodness for the coen brothers their success has brought them bigger budgets but hasn t rid them of their creativity i had planned on seeing another movie but it was sold out so i went to this one instead by the time it began i had forgotten what movie i was there to see i was surprised in more ways than one this movie is hilarious but they don t make any cheap jokes just to get the laughs the writing is brilliant and delivered with great skill by george clooney after this nobody can say he s just a pretty face and the rest of the cast it can be appreciated on many levels whether you remember the odyssey or not i can t remember the last time i saw a movie that was this clever i ve seen others i would describe as beautiful intriguing funny and charming all of which also describe oh brother but this movie reminded me of older seinfeld episodes where all the subplots came together in the end you can feel that their journey is building up to something but you can t tell what and the coen brothers do not fail us the end is certainly not disappointing it s surprising and ties up all the loose ends neatly without wearing the story out,1
1792,where to start where to start hmmm well how about some of the stiffest most unnatural unbelievable and camped up performances one can imagine how about stereotypical characters situations and locations or what about a manipulative cloying utterly wretched script i can t think of one element in this movie that was original worthy of watching or interesting note to all you josh hartnett chris klein leelee sobieski fans enjoy their collective fifteen minutes folks because they re not going to be famous much longer,0
1291,i haven t watched this show in months but for a while i was forced to watch it every day because i had a roommate that liked it so maybe it s undergone some vast improvement in all that time although the commercials and the 4 2 rating on imdb aren t a good sign it was clearly just a quick replacement for chappelle s show even mencia says so and while i wasn t even that big a fan of chappelle s show his jokes were at least original and clever and far edgier than mencia has ever been mencia s jokes are completely unoriginal and stale if you can t see that i guess there s just no hope for you but to be fair here are some examples mencia blatantly rips off chapelle s lil jon skit just takes it south park makes an episode about scientology one week later mencia has a joke on his show about how offensive he is to scientologists bear in mind the joke isn t about scientologists but about how much he s offended them on his show when up to this point he has never made a single scientology joke ever after hurricane katrina two ap photos go around the internet showing a black man looting groceries and a white woman finding them weeks later after millions of people have already seen this mencia presents it on his show as if he discovered it and it s being shown for the first time the daily show would have been on something like that in a day pathetic even more annoying than the joke stealing is the way carlos has promoted himself and his show claiming he s breaking down some sort of pc barrier whatever and that if you aren t laughing you must be a weak prude who can t handle any jokes about race yes carlos it s not because you re not funny it s because we re all too offended to laugh if that was really true then why was chappelle s show so popular he constantly berates his audience for not getting it if he doesn t get enough laughs and often repeats and explains his jokes a technique most comedians stop using by age 14 the worst part is that mencia does not seem to be very intelligent it s sort of tragic that there are dozens of funnier more insightful comedians out there trying to make it while this guy is rolling in money his show is supposedly the third highest rated on comedy central which is baffling again it has a 4 2 rating on this site where the hell are they getting these numbers comedy central tries to bill itself as an edgy station but as long as it tries to appeal to the dumbest audience possible that will never be the case,0
24031,okay to enjoy this silent comedy short you must suspend disbelief concerning the major starting point for the film if you can t then you ll probably be more likely to score this film a lot lower charlie chase has a huge overbite and his wife has a nose large enough to have its own area code unknown to each other they have both been saving to have surgery to correct these defects apparently plastic and dental surgery was better back in the 1920s because neither seemed to have any need to recuperate from these major surgeries and they looked just dandy right away okay remember i said to ignore this right okay well you also have to then ignore the difficult to believe idea that both could then meet and have no idea the other is their spouse okay now that you allowed yourself to accept these two silly premises the film gets really really good charlie makes a pass at her and she makes a pass at him both are shocked and thrilled because no one has ever really considered them attractive so because of this new vanity they agree to go on a date but they both sneak back home not wanting their spouses to know anyway they meet later and are quite attracted to each other but what about the poor spouses supposedly at home well they both learn that the other is married and both anticipate their marriages will result in divorce because they really want to be with each other late in the film charlie figures out that the woman really is his wife and he goes through a very funny sequence where he plays both the boyfriend and the old husband by changing his clothes and putting in false teeth when he plays the hubby it really is a laugh riot to see him bouncing in and out of the room as he appears to be fighting with another person you really have to see it to believe it however the wife sees an ad with charlie s before and after photos and knows what s happening in the end they both feel pretty foolish,1
9310,the acting is awkward and creepy and not in a good way at all the writing the dialogue and the chemistry between the actors is horrible nothing makes sense and every close up of an actor s expression or reaction lasts 3 or 4 seconds too long making it seem like a mexican soap opera telenovela everything about the writing is unrealistic and all of the actors involved make it that much worse with their campy interpretations of the script am i the only one who sees this to use the word cheesy to describe this canadian disaster would be the understatement of the century did the director even watch the final cut before it was put on the air,0
20694,r 88 brilliant very entertaining show with spectacular effects any fan of these prehistoric reptiles has to see this the cgi blends in extremely well with the environment and it s just plain fun to watch these giants walk about their daily business as casually as on discovery channel this show was a stroke of genius and it blows its followers walking with beasts and the future is wild out of the water the greatest episode was definitely the last where we got to watch the final days of the tyrannosaurus rex and the meteor strike that became their doom this stuff is almost too awesome for television how about a theatrical release i would pay anything to see these dinos in the cinema if you re in the mood for a show that manages to be spectacular engaging and educational at the same time this is for you dinosaurs have never been cooler,1
23456,i have just read what i believe to be an analysis of this film by a lyrical irishman lovely to read however a concise analysis of this film is that it is a interweaving of the seven deadly sins with the four types of justice envy greed pride sloth anger etc and justice in the forms of retributive distributive blind and divine i could demonstrate three examples of each one for each of the three protagonists however it is much more fun to note them for oneself this is an excellent film don t miss it,1
4433,jeez when i heard this movie was a national lampoons i thought it was going to be awesome but i really got a say it was a rather disappointment i have seen the most movies they ve made from christmas vacation to van wilder and this movie is the worst movie in their name really bad actors and a to much intense movie this movie is probably good to watch if you are watching it with a crowd of worked up people and the ability to laugh at it but if you are into good comedy s like i am i do not suggest this movie i would much rather watch van wilder a second or third time than to watch this movie you have been warned,0
11479,the film makers went well out of their way to find only the following demographics palestinians that have the appearance of peace loving solution seeking good will palestinians particularly older women and families with children who are especially inconvenienced by the security fence and israelis that don t believe in the security fence sympathize heavily with its alleged effect on palestinians and consider it unnecessarily divisive and or a waste of money oh yes they do put in one member of the israeli government that does support the fence but they do what they can to portray him as inhumane and uncaring and ask him very leading questions that are really statements e g the wall is bad for the environment it is destroying everything i have no problem with any well most of this being presented in the movie however much i may disagree with the people they interview their opinions are valid enough for a documentary however there are at least two sides to the issue of israel s security fence and despite the fact that an overwhelming majority of israelis and many others support the construction of the fence and believe it is having an overall positive influence this documentary does not present the opinion of even one such person they even go so far as to interview an israeli jew who claims that all israelis support the fence and are thus insane and then stubbornly refuse to interview even one such crazy israeli oh and to top all this off they set the tone for the film by interviewing a couple of young israeli children truly exceptions to the rule i ve been there that are laughing at about their arab neighbors from across the fence a documentary is a film that explores an issue and presents a full array of facts opinions and perspectives unfortunately this is not a documentary this is an unabashed propaganda film that very clearly very pointedly offers a battery of support for only one side of a heavily disputed emotionally and politically charged issue it is no more of a documentary than say fahrenheit 9 11,0
16679,this film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow it accomplished this through the energetic performances of the leads the steadiness of the camera work avoiding rock video clich s that were actually invented for the beatles in their first two films tight editing and a non judgmental presentation of the star as human being rather than symbol or god or demon yes there are minor holes in the plot and incidental details that are a little unnecessary and there will always be debate between families of those personally involved as to specifics but the issue here as in the much more recent i walk the line or carpenter s famed tv elvis biopic of the same era is whether the meaning of the performer s life in its time and place as a catalyst for fans ideals and appreciation is made manifest in the performance and this is clearly the case here we come away from this movie understanding not only how buddy holly became a star but why i don t see what else one could want from the film,1
9561,franco zeffirelli s the taming of the shrew romeo and juliet jesus of nazareth othello third stab at transferring shakespeare to the screen works very well with the casting of mel gibson mad max lethal weapon and pre the passion of the christ notoriety in the role formerly owned by sir laurence olivier and rightly so see my review on his hamlet arguably the best interpretation of one of the bard s timeless and most quoted tragedies and redone 5 years later by kenneth branagh as a full bloodied treatment explaining its 3 hour 22 minute running time combined with a dream cast and a lot of little additions which were well chosen and expertly done by the contemporary master of william shakespeare kenneth branagh the director of henry v and dead again joining the lethal weapon star are glenn close the big chill paul scofield a man for all seasons alan bates ian holm michael maloney who would be cast as roderigo opposite kenneth branagh and laurence fishburne in oliver parker s othello see my review of olivier s stage version of the tragedy though he only starred in it and who branagh would cast as laertes in his 3 hour version of hamlet a proper homage to sir laurence olivier and his classic version of the play see my review on that one as well 5 years later nathaniel parker who would be cast as cassio in his brother s version of othello 4 years later and helena bonham carter who would be cast in mary shelley s frankenstein 4 years later zeffirelli intended this movie as a homage to sir laurence olivier who had died 2 years prior to this movie and it works pretty well for the most part what i was slightly uncomfortable with was zeffirelli s misplacing a lot of lines and in one scene he gives one of hamlet s lines to the ghost also helena bonham carter did not convince me as ophelia she was too dull and unreal whereas jean simmons who had immortalized the role in olivier s version and kate winslet who did an acceptable job in kenneth branagh s uncut epic revisionist reworking of hamlet were good in the role with jean simmons being the best ophelia ever that s why she was nominated for best actress in 1948 she didn t win what a shame ian holm said his lines too quickly not slowly as i expected him to in a scene with him laertes and ophelia but then again i m more used to felix aylmer and richard briers interpretations of the role and i think that they did better jobs than holm in their respective versions of hamlet both done by great directors actors text editors producers and stars of all their versions of the bard s work as polonius the rest of the cast however was excellent the scene where hamlet confronts his mother was very well done but olivier and branagh heightened the scene to better lengths to create even more emotional intensity and suspense that the scene required i recommend this version just to pass the time but it s ideal as a teaching tool for 12th grade english teachers i recommend showing olivier s version first then branagh s and finally this version despite the film s pg rating there was really nothing objectionable in the movie only what the play called for the best versions of hamlet are 1 sir laurence olivier and kenneth branagh both were so good that i can t decide which one was the best see my reviews on these versions for more information 2 franco zeffirelli this one was alright it started out alright with a scene not in the play but should ve then progressed to the actual beginning of the play where a guard cries out who s there nay answer me stand and unfold yourself that scene scares the hell out of you because you re sitting quietly and then bam you almost jump out of your skin in short that scene sets the tone for the rest of the play huge blunder on zeffirelli s part to omit that scene it also misplaced a lot of lines and cut others that i think should ve been put in such as the line where hamlet says to ophelia get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners that line was supposed to have occurred in that scene not where it was placed in the film after the to be or not to be soliloquy this version struggles between cutting out too much or too little from an excellent piece of literature kenneth branagh would remedy that 5 years later with his uncut version of the tragedy making his version a more fitting homage to sir laurence olivier as several of the actors aside from him had performed hamlet on stage or on film many times on different occasions however zeffirelli s take on hamlet is faithful to the play and that s what i was looking for the setup for the final act duel was the same as in olivier and branagh s versions only that the denouement in branagh s version was more violent than the denouement of the previous two faithful versions more in line with the play olivier toned it down and it worked equally well and stuck more closely to the play with branagh throwing in a few harmless touches of his own to very good effect this version is not rated,0

24250,penelope spheeris of wayne s world fame made her mark with the documentary the decline of western civilization about the la punk scene in the late 70s and early 80s most of the documentary features interviews with the punks and footage of concerts which often turn violent overall we get to see how the punk movement was a reaction to the hippies whereas the hippies were into being natural the punks wanted to have themselves as altered as possible what with spiked hair and all but also we see how they re really disaffected and sometimes becoming skinheads anyway this is a really great time capsule we re not really sure whether we want to long for that era or feel repulsed by it but this is definitely not a documentary that will leave you neutral truly worth seeing,1
8754,this movie contains the worst acting performance of all time spilsbury lacks energy to say the least energy is what clayton moore gave us in spades i never felt once in this movie that spilsbury was anxious for anything revenge love justice not in this guy s portrayal there is also no chemistry between tonto and lr if the plot did not force them to be friends you don t get the impression they want to hang out with each other plus the sidekick has the more interesting personality ewww the dialogue is predictable and boring the narration is stunningly bad and if you are familiar with the dukes of hazzard you can picture what this is like i cannot believe the director would agree to this it insulted me as a viewer by explaining every plot line i just witnessed hey at least the horses and locations looked good maybe that is what happens when you hire a cinematographer to be your director rating 2 you may be able to watch this one for laughs or to demonstrate to an alien what a bad movie is,0
5115,do not be misled this is not a zombie movie take it from a guy who loves zombie movies and who rents them all the good and the horrendous yes this movie has an extended zombie sequence but it s basically an artsy fartsy exercise in existentialist dread which is a long way of saying it s boring if you ve worked hard all day and want to spend a couple of hours being entertained rent something else rise of the undead has cheap special effects mediocre acting and crummy dialogue all of that is understandable in an indie low budget film and i can forgive such flaws as long as a movie has an entertaining story to tell unfortunately rise of the undead hardly has any story at all moreover the acting is not laughably bad so much as non existent all of the actors seem to have studied at the buster keaton school of wooden faces would it have killed them to show some emotion and no yelling does not equate with emoting the one character who actually had some pizazz was killed off first granted there was another character who briefly held my interest he looked and acted like kyle mclachlan channeling norman bates but it was too little too late the filmmakers seemed to have forgotten a tiny detail film is a visual medium that means lighting your scenes well enough for the viewer to actually view what s going on and all those artsy jump cuts and close ups might have seemed cool at the time but all they did was make watching the film jarring and confusing there is nothing wrong with telling a story in a simple clear fashion just look at george romero s low budget night of the living dead to see how it s done superbly and i know these folks had a small budget but if you can t hire the equipment and technicians necessary to actually make the dialogue audible then just go ahead and make a silent movie then those buster keaton wooden faces might actually work i will say this for the film the zombies were creepy unlike most zombie movies where the undead are shown in all their decomposing glory the grosser the better the zombies here were just shuffling bloody faced people it actually worked to make them more like us and therefore scarier that s the reason i gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 the sad part about all this is that despite all of its flaws rise of the undead does not insult your intelligence the filmmakers seemed to have actually wanted to make a smart scary original movie and it s a shame that they failed so miserably if they could just forego the too fancy editing buy a few extra lightbulbs crank up the dialogue and come up with a real story that actually goes somewhere then i think they have the talent to make something really good trust me do not waste your time on rise of the undead,0
14624,like another poster mentioned ch 56 a local boston tv station showed this multiple times over the years on saturday afternoons they paired it with the first sequel return of the ginat majin now i haven t seen it since then but it never left me aside from the atrocious dubbing and faded color this was a pretty good fantasy technically it isn t horror until the statue comes to life at the end it s just about a village ruled over by an evil man there s a giant stone statue there that the villagers keep praying to to help them to no avail but things go too far the statute comes to life and destroys the bad guys but then it starts going after the good guys too well done with some cool special effects at the end loved how he got rid of the main bad guy also there was an enchanted forest worked in which was kind of interesting too no masterpiece but an unusual combo fantasy horror film worth catching but not if it s the dubbed print,1
21614,i wasn t sure about getting this movie on dvd because i really do have something against people making black and white films in the 21st century but i ended up buying it anyway i still don t understand why it had to be black and white but that s the only negativity i can see about the film and it sure is a perfect example to see the definitive rise of brazilian cinema not everyone can understand a film like this but it s quite rewarding to those who do unlike o homem que copiava the surrealism fits this movie pretty well and the acting is at least as good as that one or other successful brazilian films such as bicho de sete cabe as cidade de deus brava gente brasileira etc my only hope is that this gem doesn t get insulted and raped by a crappy hollywood remake it s amazing to see how those guys spend zillions of dollars and still can t make a movie that s 1 as good as this possibly low budget flick bravo to the entire crew 10 10,1
13377,a buster keaton silent short poor buster becomes the goat scapegoat for a dangerous escaped murderer this is a wonderful hilarious little film with keaton at his absolute best in what is essentially a series of chases buster gets to exercise his endlessly inventive imagination big joe roberts appears as the highly suspicious police chief born into a family of vaudevillian acrobats buster keaton 1895 1966 mastered physical comedy at a very early age an association with fatty arbuckle led to a series of highly imaginative short subjects and classic silent feature length films all from 1920 to 1928 writer director star stuntman buster could do it all and his intuitive genius gave him almost miraculous knowledge as to the intricacies of film making and of what it took to please an audience more akin to fairbanks than chaplin buster s films were full of splendid adventure exciting derring do and the most dangerous physical stunts imaginable his theme of a little man against the world who triumphs through bravery ingenuity dominates his films through every calamity disaster buster remained the great stone face a stoic survivor in a universe gone mad in the late 1920 s buster was betrayed by his manager brother in law and his contract was sold to mgm which proceeded to nearly destroy his career teamed initially with jimmy durante and eventually allowed small roles in mediocre comedies buster was for 35 years consistently given work far beneath his talent finally before lung cancer took him at age 70 he had the satisfaction of knowing that his classic films were being rediscovered now well past his centenary buster keaton is routinely recognized appreciated as one of cinema s true authentic geniuses and he knew how to make people laugh,1
2975,simon west s remake of the 1979 horror classic is a pathetic attempt to bring old school thrills to a contemporary audience starring talented teen camilla belle when a stanger calls fails to even elicit a shocked or even surprised face poor attempts at scaring the audience range from blurred coats that look like people to building the tense music up for a cat running out of the shadows the plot follows jill johnson belle a teenage girl that has to pay off a bill to her father via babysitting she is invited to work for the night at a house by the river and thinks it a perfectly easy way to make cash but little does she know a stranger lurks in the house and constantly harasses johnson via the phone a pathetic excuse for a film,0
9911,than you easily spot the biggest fault of the movie what was the motive the details of the murders were used but never explained i guess the team got too much into the atmosphere which is great but the story is definitely lacking there is no thread to follow i guess if that was done properly the movie would ve lasted a bit longer but it would ve been worth it at least for me casting is very good i loved wilson as the vulnerable vicky not much more to say really but i really wish they ve concentrated a bit more on the less obvious,0
8130,i tried i really really tried to think of something that would merit rating this higher than a two it s not that i don t get it i m a big fan of asian cinema the truth is the movie is infantile in construction long winded and painfully disjointed i suppose that if you are of alfred hitchcock s school of thought don t tell them show them then you could try to appreciate this movie but you would still be hard pressed first of all the terrorizers tries stream of consciousness in the style of jean luc godard and fails in this edward yang seems to understand the basics of the technique but he s very unskilled at it perhaps he gets better with age i don t know as i haven t yet attempted other yang films the point is he uses a dearth of show don t tell that really only serves to interrupt the procession of the story sure he gets in some visually arresting images but they don t draw the story together and they don t help to make it any better additionally the major concept behind stream of consciousness and show don t tell is that with the right images the right drama repetition and tight correlation the viewer will be able to make his or her own inferences not to say that these will be the correct inferences but those can be amended as the story progresses and every director should strive for some of this type of audience interaction in this edward yang sorely disappoints the viewer is constantly on the periphery there is no reason to be drawn in no reason to consider the characters or their motives no reason to get emotionally involved and really no reason to stay alert finally yang gets lost in the story that he wants to tell not the story that the movie itself is telling his art moves in one direction but like a large dog he can t control he s constantly yanking the lead trying to get it back onto the course he wants not the one that it is naturally following the most egregious example of this is the ending the ending really should have occurred at the moment of the husband s revelation the ending of the book that the movie is focusing on and by extension a possible ending for the movie has already been told to us if yang had chosen to end at that point he would have had a much more powerful piece leaving the watcher in suspense does the story play out as the book says or does yang s real world play out differently asking the viewer to think about this is the sort of viewer interaction that yang painfully needs instead he continues to tell the story he wants to tell straining the natural conclusion for the sake of what for the sheer sake of lingering on a main character we didn t need to know more about her superficially and yang wouldn t feel the need to tell us if he hadn t made her into a veneer instead of bothering to make her a more engaging and deep character to begin with why else does yang prolong and torture his movie to get in some more of those visually arresting images the movie truly suffers for it it wants to end it has a conclusion that feels natural and leaves the viewer unsettled but instead yang pushes on instead yang constructs a complex ending that leads the viewer on causing him or her to constantly ask so what the first ending the one that yang ignored that was good the second ending well my thought was so what who cares because it s not as if it is introducing something that hasn t been put forth in the storyline already but the last ending that really was a waste of time not only did the real ending leave me disengaged but i also felt it was an affront to what the story could have been yang sacrificed a potentially good story for the bubblegum melancholy noir tinged conclusion that he had insisted upon all along my last problem with the movie has nothing to do with the movie itself but rather its post production the subbing if you see it subbed is horrible long sentences stay up for a second or two while short ones stay up far too long also as yang quickly changes images the subtitles are removed from the screen this is one of those rare instances that subtitles should be able to stay on the screen even as the image has changed because there s not much dialog going on anyway,0
24204,an intense dark action drama with unusually rich support from casey keith et al many of whom get the best roles of their careers and run with it the film is oddly shaped often the action slows down just to let the characters get caught up in odd but well done seemingly improved dialogues during the stakeouts almost all of the machine get caught up in perfectly delivered humorous monologues and reynolds the director deserves mucho credit for having reynolds the star step back and give them room and unlike most action films you really get to like the characters which makes the 2nd half when their various destinies good and bad unfold unusually affecting the combination of character development brutal violence a jazzy soundtrack tarantino must be a fan watch this then jackie brown and you ll see what i m talking about make this occasionally flawed film the bad guys are a bit melodramatic one of the better modern cop films and in my mind superior to many of the overrated modern noirs such as body heat such,1
6371,the costumes are outrageous and the australian outback scenery is fun to view but there is an edge to this story a mean edge about drag queens i particularly noticed that in terrence stamp s character ralph bernadette bassenger perhaps that was appropriate since there is nothing good guy like about ralph bernadette and his group of queens once again we get the strong liberal slant which says anything goes and if you re not with it or in this case pro homosexual then you are a homophobe gasp what s really disturbing is the ending when a young boy goes off with his alternative lifestyle father and embraces his gay lifestyle not because it fit the story but because it fit the agenda of the people who wrote the script pitiful,0
7404,university professor justin thorne jimmy smits has got it made a good looking sophisticated teacher with a loving wife and two adorable children he plays the saxophone owns an expensive car and his students love and respect him but when temptation calls in the form of one of his bright pretty sexy and willing students jennifer carter naomi watts he foolishly gives in the next day he is being charged with her rape and his perfect life could be forever ruined when we see an american actor in australian film we know we are not in for a masterpiece but even viewed with low expectations gross misconduct is a huge flop based on a play with a rather unimaginative title and then adapted into a reasonably enjoyable book it fails to engage convince or even remotely interest its audience on a most fundamental level the script is awkward and unconvincing the acting is for most part not much better watts gives an acceptable performance demonstrating for one of the first times on screen her emotion rawness but she is the only good thing about the film which seems almost like even it can t wait to be over the direction is not horrible or distracting in anyway but it is just painfully mediocre apart from the afore mentioned naomi watts who could be forgiven seeing as this was early in her career the acting is wooden and gets steadily worse over the course of the movie the usually reliable jimmy smits doesn t seem to have been trying in this one and who could really blame him all these small failures however only add to the film s ultimate fatal flaw which is that the focus is entirely in the wrong place any empathy for the characters or interest in the outcome is lost in a sea of what is basically soft core entertainment of an adult kind by the end audiences will probably be bored tired and wishing they d done something else with their ninety minutes unless you just want to see naomi get naked 4 or 5 times you could definitely afford to give this nonevent film a miss,0
1495,the power started off looking promising but soon became boring and tedious to watch the plot is about an ancient aztec doll that takes possession of those who own it the idea is decent enough and this film would have been fairly entertaining had it been done better however after the first ten minutes or so it soon becomes boring we don t get any good death scenes and have to listen to loads of talking at the end one of the possessed men meets his death by melting away in front of two girls but it s not very interesting and definitely not gory i wouldn t recommend the power to any horror or slasher fan as there s little to be gained from it,0
23780,this film is a masterpiece it was exhilarating from beginning to end writer director paul thomas anderson s story about a porn star is told with style grace humor even poignancy the actors and the characters they play are all first rate including mark wahlberg in the lead who proves himself a solid actor and can carry a film burt reynolds gives perhaps his best performance ever as a porno director who discovers wahlberg the film recreates the late 70s and early 80s with dead on accuracy from the disco scene that begins the film to wahlberg s don johnson miami vice outfit that he wears in the final scene most regular moviegoers who see this film will no doubt compare it to pulp fiction but it really has much more in common with the films of robert altman and martin scorsese the film is a triumph in style the opening tracking shot that begins the film is just as impressive as the ones in the player and absolute beginners the editing by dylan tichenor is simply phenomenal i couldn t believe the editing didn t receive an oscar nomination good will hunting was a better edited film the best scene in the film has to be the one with the firecrackers i had butterflies in my stomach because the scene is incredibly intense when i saw the film a second time i had the exact same reaction to the scene unfortunately it may not have the same impact on tv as it did in a theater with good stereo sound it s a shame that many people didn t see this movie during its theatrical run because it is the best way to watch it anderson s use of widescreen will suffer on tv so get the dvd or a letterbox tape it is amazing how easy anderson makes it all look because this is only his second film the music sets costumes photography offbeat characters sex violence happiness and heartbreak are captured by a guy who is clearly in love with filmmaking,1
24872,you have got to see this movie i saw it as a 13 year old at the theater on my very first date fast forward over 20 years and i m now gay thanks a lot one dark night lol this movie creeped the hell out of me as a kid mausoleums still do but as an adult the thrill of this movie isn t in the storyline but rather the hysterical laughs it holds highlights are listening to the names the teenagers call each other from nerdlebrain my personal favorite to turkey also keep your eyes peeled for the scene where carol the blond head sister attempts to hang her phone up on a soda can can t believe they didn t reshoot that other highlights include adam west s overly dramatic outbursts and the gooey corpses if you re a fan of true horror i d suggest this film just because to me it s almost a parody on horror there is def a creepy factor and the plot is a good one but don t watch it if you want to be scared out of your wits unless you re like 10 years old or something,1
22043,i try to catch this film each time it s shown on tv which happily is quite often but i keep forgetting to video it as it is i practically know the script by heart but that doesn t stop me having a good cry in fact it probably adds to it as i cry knowing what s coming next it s such a lovely film well made well cast good photography i love it one of my top ten films,1
19340,i saw anatomy years ago dubbed at a friends house i don t remember it much and then i saw at the video store there is a second one not really related to the first one franka ponte makes a little cameo and that one was okay not as good as the first one i m seeing the first one again tonight not dubbed collectors edition i really like german movies like this one it s very interesting and people and cults like the one in the movie could exist i think i dunno but it s very grossly entertaining and scary anatomy 2 is a little different and the characters are not as good as the first but if you really thought anatomy was interesting and good you should see the second one,1
12809,to tell you the truth i do not speak tamil and i did not understand the film my good tamil friend kaneswaran kumarswamypillai wow what a long name explained every thing to me what a great movie after watching this movie i felt i should have watched many more movies from tollywood tamil film industry the war scenes were amazing camera work excellent and plot beautiful the actress simran what a beauty give her an award for best looking someone ding ding ding come on i smell a oscar winner i didnt understand the songs but they were excellent mani ratnam is a great director and i hope his next film was a success,1
2593,i clerk in a video store so i try to see the movies we re about to put out each week i don t have a problem with this in fact i sort of feel it s a privilege not so with this film after an hour and a half of our hero whining and growling his way through scene after scene i was truly wondering if they planned to get to the point i felt like i should be getting paid for watching this at home in my free time and if i d known there was another hour to be endured i might have given up right then i didn t care about the characters the filming was unremarkable and ford made kissing look like a chore even the score was incongruous and jarring what a waste,0
11851,ah animorphs i loved the book series and eagerly devoured each one in middle school and when i heard that there was a television adaptation i was very excited boy what a let down the final product was i think for me this was the moment when nickelodeon stopped being about cool programming and more generic so what was wrong with the series let me count the ways 1 the characters were horrifically miscast in the books the animorphs were somewhere between 12 14 the television cast were at least 18 i remember being horrified when i first saw the cast photos 2 horrific acting bad writing i dunno which was to blame so i m lumping into the lumpy mass that it was perhaps it was the fact that the accelerated age of the cast hampered the humor that is at least cute coming out of a 13 year old because marco not funny in fact i don t remember a single comical moment from the group and there were a few the actors were certainly not helped by the writing which was bland at its best and head smackingly pathetic at its worst 3 my lord they were stingy with the budget the final result of the andalites alone should have convinced viacom to pull the plug their heads had clefts that clearly showed which was the helmet 4 back to the cast rachel by far was the biggest let down far from being the warrior woman in the books the best equivalent in the tv series was scarecrow also i know cassie was an idealist but there is a difference between idealist and idiot 5 one of the worst opening titles ever did the music have to be that obvious 6 answering question 6 yes because everything else was dumbed down so why shouldn t the expectedly less intelligent viewers receive a thick as a brick song from a lame rap rock rip off or whatever the hell that was since then there have been bigger let downs iraq 2004 but in case i haven t made myself clear this show sucked and was an abomination to the book series it was supposed to be based from,0
3530,i saw this movie partly because of the sheer number of good reviews at netflix and from it i leaned a valuable lesson not a lesson about ethnic diversity however the lesson i learned is don t trust reviews yes racism sucks and people are complicated but the people who actually need to see this movie are going to be the ones who are the least drawn to it and least affected by it if they do see it the only reason that i can think of for the number of good reviews is that it s being reviewed by people who aren t used to thinking or who ve seen their first thought provoking movie and somehow think that haggis invented the concept in fact he basically made this film which should be called racism for dummies as emotionally wrenching as possible seemingly to give people who don t spend a lot of time thinking the impression that they ve discovered some fundamental truth that s never been covered in a film before zen and the art of motorcycle maintanence it s not an after school special for the unthinking masses cut into bite sized overwrought ham fisted pieces to make it easier to swallow without too much introspection it s as if they portrayed everyone as being the worst possible extreme simply to make us happy that we re such good people because we don t identify with the characters let s face it people nobody identifies with these characters because they re all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reverse stereotypes it s well acted even if the dialog is atrocious and cleverly executed so much that you don t think to ask where s the beef until you can tell the film is winding down the flaming car scene was well executed like much of the movie but went nowhere in the end the messages are very heavy handed and from the behind the scenes blurb the producers were clearly watching a different movie because there is very little to laugh about in this movie even during the intended funny parts i have to stress that this is not entertainment more like a high school diversity lesson call it the blood on the highway of racism they could even show this in high schools if it weren t for the side nude shot of jennifer esposito in this film everyone s a jerk and everyone learns a lesson except for michael pena who gets the best role but the most predictable storyline this is a bad film with bad writing and good actors an ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who can t handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling a picture painted with crayons crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things,0
15163,i watched this movie at the first showing available in my area and it was quite clear that most people didn t get the movie even if you don t it s a good movie with some interesting character development it is a thoroughly human story about some very imperfect people in a backwoods southern town and really speaks to the root of the blues if you don t know what the black snake moan is by the time you leave the theater you didn t get it and no it s not just a song christina ricci does a great job and is thoroughly convincing in her role as is samuel l jackson i think this is his best performance since his role in pulp fiction and probably his best including that because of the range of his character in bsm the rest of the cast is solid with a few shining performances here and there particularly john cothran jr as reverend r l i m a very selective movie watcher and this film honestly rates among my favorites because of its candid look at race sex religion and neurosis in a rural southern town along with its cinematic genius in my opinion,1
10176,this movie is nothing more than christian propaganda it started off like a good sci fi movie and then works a syrupy sweet christian theme into the story which is totally unrelated i had to turn it off half way through because i felt tricked into renting it the catholic church has officially announced that aliens do not contradict belief in god the movie is slightly entertaining despite this but the dialog is unbelievable writing and acting is mostly rubbish and all in all this movie is mostly a stinker to be avoided there was obviously some research done into the phenomenon by the filmmakers but then you quickly realize that it is only for the purpose to debunk and inject their own paranoid religious views into a valid interesting subject if you are a zealous religious fanatic who believes in demons and angels you will love this movie,0
17222,yes 2 37 is in some ways a rip off from gus van sants elephant it s about some students who are dealing with their problems leading to the suicide of one of them yes it s full of clich s but that s life you just can t deny that creepy nerds disabled persons or popular students who despite their popularity do have problems are existing in the real world but that s not what this film is all about it s not about life in highschool it s not about the misery of life itself if you look beneath the surface beneath the soap like social relationships that are shown you will find some gripping thought provoking criticism of our society why are people committing suicide do we really understand their motives or are we just trying to understand after its already too late and why is it always someone you would never have expected it to be this movie doesn t answer this question but it raises it and it does so in a very intense way all the way it keeps you guessing whose blood it might be that you see at the very beginning you are following the paths of some students all of them having a more or less good reason to end their lives just to be forced to watch the gruesome act in the finale did you know who it would be or were you caught by surprise like in real life the message is verbalized by one of the surviving kids in the end we are always so fixed on our own problems we forget to see those of others there might be someone a colleague a friend who does not want to live anymore but if you don t open your eyes you ll never know until its too late this movie delivers well it might have some flaws but they don t matter anymore when its over either you see a reflection of society or you are blind for reality,1
5390,illuminata has expanded the limits of john turturro s mediocrity from second rate actor to third rate director writer and producer this film was dreadful it is disjointed and flits from scene to scene with little flow or meaning relevant to the main story line we are served with a smorgasbord of fragmented scenes each a non sequitur to all the others the only thread that seems to run through them is that they occur in the lives of the members of the same theatre repertory company the few scenes that do matter to the plot are so convoluted that you frequently can t tell if the dialogue is from the story or the actors running their lines for the play within the story if this story were a person it would be a schizophrenic with mulitple personality disorder it couldn t decide if it was a drama a romance a comedy a tragedy a sex farce or a parody of theatre it came closest to being bearable as a sex farce turturro was lifeless and impassive as tuccio supposedly a complex and passionate writer whose play gets its big chance when the currently running show needs to be cancelled due to the illness of the lead actor susan sarandon gave a good performance as the aging actress trying to seduce tuccio for a role unfortunately she found it necessary to go topless which only goes to illustrate that the hardware of aging sex symbols is much better left to the imagination christoher walkin gave a delightful performance as the uppity theatre critic who makes impassioned overtures to a member of the cast beverly d angelo and ben gazzara also had minor roles i gave this film a 2 other than walken s vignette there is really not much to recommend it except that the puppets used in the opening and closing credits were phenomenally lifelike and beautiful avoid this movie like the plague that it is,0
7891,paul muni and bette davis overact monstrously while lacklustre studio hack archie mayo seems distracted and oblivious in this racially provocative film that derives its bittersweet ending by condoning segregationist attitudes heavy handed and poorly constructed the film collapses under its own weight within the first fifteen minutes with an out of control courtroom scene that it never recovers from as mr muni begins to chew up scenery by the yard hollering and howling away in an almost incoherent fashion johnny ramirez is a mexican american from the other side of the tracks who through determination and grit attains a law degree from a store front night school in his first big case involving an auto accident he displays only ineptitude and is quickly made to look the fool by his well heeled opponents and an impatient judge who recommends he be disbarred devastated by the setback an angry johnny takes on a job at a gambling joint where he is befriended by the owner charlie roark eugene palette who likes his style the owner cuts him in on the place but problems arise with mrs roark davis who also wants a piece of johnny she kills charlie implicates johnny and slowly goes mad before he is acquitted and free to be with a high society wasp who coldly explains to him that they are from different tribes savage and it will never work when she flees to escape his rage she is run over and killed by a car ramirez sells the casino and moves back to his poor neighborhood rationalizing that its best to stay with your own in addition to this appalling denouement bordertown has a series of bad performances to compliment the overall ugliness of the story unfair as his plight might be muni s ramirez is so abrasive and arrogant it becomes hard to show sympathy for such a bull headed blunderer davis is no better as the less than loyal wife matching the same adolescent emotions of muni her lady macbeth mad scenes give no indication that she was about to become the best film actress of her era margaret lindsay as muni s american dream is cold remote and flat bad as bordertown is and it is very it remains an interesting indicator of the times and acceptable attitudes the rest is just a mishmash of bad acting and uninspired direction,0

14681,after reading more than my fair share of reviews for a vast number of different movies i have noticed a certain trend people judge to harshly on what the expected to see i figure if you go into a movie open minded not expecting anything certain than you will have better feelings towards it then if you try and watch but have pre created standards you want it to reach since i try not to be hypocritical i watched this movie with a very clean slate and open mind and was very much pleased since it is not a mainstream title or award winning for that matter i did not know quite what to expect but in all truth i enjoyed it a good deal more than ninja scroll lovely animation deep story and the always joyful ninja hack n slashing combined extremely well to one of my personal favorite animes ever made i am not promising that you will enjoy it but just give it a chance and you may come out with a pleasant surprise before speaking be sure of what you will say will be more beautiful than the silence chinese proverb,1
3913,i have seen this movie twice once a few years ago in college and again this past weekend although i absolutely despised it the first time i decided to give it another chance terrence malick is clearly a well respected director and it seems that the imdb viewers at least think very highly of the film but unfortunately it seems my tastes haven t changed at all where to start for one thing linda manz s narration is horrific her voice is so irritating with that horrendous new york accent please don t try and convince me that chicagoans talk that way they don t she herself admitted to just sitting down and talking about random things which does not make her a talented actress she s not even acting i came on imdb expecting to see her ripped apart since her performance is just so utterly laughable but people actually seemed to like it she s simply unappealing in every way i kept hoping malick would just kill her off the other actors were fine but certainly nothing special adams was probably the strongest in the cast but she also had the only decent part except the old guy he was pretty good speaking of acting how could shepard s character be so ridiculously stupid he bought the brother and sister act because uh why would he buy that bill and abby took every single opportunity to be touchy feely as though they didn t realize that their lives depended on acting in a very platonic way it was just completely unbelievable and finally after a considerable amount of time the farmer suddenly realizes that oh my god they re together then he goes after bill with a gun but instead seems to trip into bill s hand and ends up with a mortal stab wound speaking of which the fate of the characters was similarly stupid and dare i say lazy of course bill has to die could it be more boring than getting shot in a pond by a pack of cops abby goes on with her happy life getting on a train and feeling really content about the way things worked out and the irksome narrator randomly finds her deadbeat friend and they wander off into the sunset but it s okay because malick never gave me any reason to care about the characters anyway as for the plot this film drags along endlessly with no real plot twists or development i can t believe it s only 94 minutes long i could have sworn i was sitting in my seat for a solid 3 hours the sudden locust disaster was like throwing the bible in my face i m totally fine with metaphors and allusions but this was completely over the top clearly the message was don t marry for money or bad things will happen to you very original i understand that days of heaven like all of terrence malick s films is meant to be a piece of art and i will certainly agree that the cinematography is simply stunning and the magic hour shots add a unique aura to the film but i need more than nice pictures to enjoy a film and this one just didn t do it for me,0
13908,this two character drama is extremely well acted and has a valid message and some truly shocking moments shocking not because they are graphic but because you re not prepared for them when they come but eventually it does become oppressive just like the somewhat similar a pure formality did still alan rickman should have gotten an oscar nomination for his multi dimensional performance no doubt about it 1 2,1
6172,i hate it when people in the movie theater talk back to the screen it s one of the main reasons why i stick to dvd s or videos i saw the clearing on dvd but if i had seen it in the movies i would have had to stand up and scream he s not dead yet you moron the clearing is another in a long list of horrible movies that feature mr redford legal eagles havana indecent proposal up close and personal sneakers last castle and spy game if robert redford told me to invest in something i d go the other way but the worst possible thing you can do to an audience is this say you re being kidnapped and your kidnapper has a gun he s holding it on you for most of the movie you turn the tables on him and start strangling him whatever you do keep strangling him until he s dead don t just strangle him for ten seconds stay with it ten minutes at least but bob stops too soon walks away and forgets about mr kidnapper until he gets up finds the gun and holds it on our hero again at this point i wanted mr kidnapper to shoot robert redford more than a few times and i wanted to shoot him as well,0
18719,smartly written well acted intense and suspenseful this show lives in the real world not as fantastical as is 24 and i am a huge fan of 24 incidentally it has believable characters and in many ways is much smarter than most in this genre it tries to present both sides of islam so far i have watched the first 4 episodes and find the story to be more evenly balanced the terrorists are more complex and not one dimensional and as a result of that balance the terrorists become more frightening than the typical villains being portrayed in film and on television last but not least the hero is truly heroic without being a cartoon i recommend this show for anyone who is a fan of 24 and the like,1
12312,it seems at least vaguely possible that this movie provided a bit of inspiration for the sopranos as its main character martin blank john cusack is a hit man who has so many issues from his past and his profession that he s in therapy trying to deal with it all everything finally comes to a head at his 10 year high school reunion the problem was that by the time blank got to the reunion i had stopped caring frankly i found this movie a drag from start to finish it had potential there was a reasonably good cast headed by cusack and dan aykroyd playing grocer his arch rival in the hit man business along with minnie driver as debi blank s high school sweetheart who he stood up on prom night and a limited role for alan arkin as dr oatman blank s psychologist that fairly talented cast never really seemed to come together though the drama lacked intensity and the comedy lacked real humour what i thought had the most potential to be a comedic storyline was grocer s proposal for a hit man s union but aside from becoming a bit of a running joke the idea never really got developed as for the romance one wondered why debi would even think of letting this guy back into her life there were a handful of chuckles but nothing really caught me and held me and i spent most of the movie wondering whether this thing was ever going to start to click it never did not for me at least 2 10,0
22290,this is a really sad and touching movie it deals with the subject of child abuse it s really sad but mostly a true story because it happens everyday elijah wood and joseph mazzello play the two children or lorraine bracco a single mother who just tries to make a home for them while living with her parents a man who likes to be called the king comes into their life he hits the youngest boy bobby but the two brothers vow not to tell their mother but finally she finds out after the bobby is hurt badly the end kind of ruined it for me because it is so totally unbelievable but except for that i love the movie,1
20971,living in romania i was almost stunned by the very realistic setting for the scenes and the great care paid to local details by the director the performance of anthony queen is absolutely great and the rest of the cast does a great job supporting him the movie does take a little knowledge of the east european context in order to be fully enjoyed but it remains otherwise a great performance with some memorable lines the ending is maybe a bit too melodramatic but that s actually the way people are in this part of the world i believe the screenplay is great because it presents the horrors of the 2nd ww in a most original manner no blood no battlefields still lives are shattered and the smiles you get every now and then throughout the movie are quickly killed by the war realities touching the characters,1
12848,this is a classic war movie one of the best a stark image fest of flashing lights harrowing dark backgrounds and helicopter blades morphing into ceiling fans a star studded spectacle of immense power martin sheen is a mercenary sent up river to assassinate the general gone astray a sadistic dictator played beyond belief by the great marlon brando also along for the ride are robert duvall as an over the top di with a penchant for napalm in the morning or at least the smell of it dennis hopper is an edgy photojournalist with a view slanted views about the war and about his leader also in this amazing film you ll see up and coming stars such as laurence fishburne r lee ermey sam bottoms albert hall and keep an eye out for harrison ford too behind the lens is francis ford coppolla delivering a film with maybe more intensity and drama than the acclaimed godfather films he highlights war in it s most basic form which for the most part is something you can t see you can only feel it as the boat carries on up river the feeling of the war tightening in is quite unbearable the feeling of this is a rather claustrophobic feeling and really makes for unusual moods from the viewers honestly no films has ever made me feel like that criticism is hard to find the biggest qualm from some is that brando earned tons of money for a ten minute role but in all fairness this is unjustified it was money well earned a role that physically restricted him being at the time an unwell man and a role that he really made his own i can t picture anyone better for the role and if you get the apocalypse now redux version there s some extra bits of the great man and i think the redux does make the film miles better final impressions are that if you are lucky to get the redux version then you will be blessed with a completely satisfying film with a cool 49 minutes extra footage if not then still you won t be disappointed this film is up there with the best and deserves some great recognition and a firm place as one of the top 50 films ever made,1
14792,stephen sondheim s sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street opened on broadway on 1 march 1979 with len cariou and angela lansbury in the leading roles although it swept virtually every award imaginable the box office fell short of expectations and the original production ended its run at 557 performances fortunately however the play then went on tour and along the way was captured on film the result is a remarkable capture of the play featuring george hern who replaced cariou and lansbury in a close approximation of the original broadway staging there is however a flaw simply stated stage plays do not film very well for a performance that works well on the stage must fill the theatre and is therefore very very large and when placed on film such performances often seem slightly static oppressively aggressive or both sweeney todd is no exception seen on film it has a stand and sing quality and while both hern and lansbury seem to have modulated their performances for the sake of the camera such is not the case with betsy joslyn as joanna her larger than life performance reads on film as unpleasantly frantic and her extremely operatic voice feels out of place when contrasted with the voices of the overall cast taking this stage play on film effect into consideration however this really is an exceptional performance of a unique and macabrely comic musical in the operetta style lansbury is astonishing a mixture of silliness stupidity and cunning malice while hern truly owns the role of the psychotic barber whose clients go to their graves impeccably shaved the overall cast is quite fine and although the film does not let us see quite enough of the set there is enough on display for it to be impressive and the music who can argue with what most consider sondheim s finest work the story itself is extremely well known particularly in england in 1846 thomas peckett prest cobbled together several urban myths for a short story he titled a string of pearls within a year or so it was adapted to the stage as sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street and in an era that knew little of copyright law variations of the play were soon playing all over england each one however was more or less the same sweeney todd a barber kills the men who come to him for a shave mrs lovett his associate bakes them up into pies and feeds them to an unsuspecting public the sondheim version is specifically based on a 1973 version by christopher bond the story is very grand guignol with a lot of blood bodies dropping down chutes and grotesque humor at the same time however the music lyrics and subplot of an innocent in the clutches of evil open out the subject to numerous lyric charms one would not expect sondheim s lyrics are often ironic but never more so than here he intertwines a great deal of wicked satire re industry and capitalism along the way and certainly one cannot fault the strange yet victorian elegant of his complex music like the concert version starring hern and patti lupone this particular film also provides us with several selections that were cut from the 2007 tim burton film version most particularly the opening attend the tale of sweeney todd which runs like a thread throughout the play it is also in my opinion considerably more comic than the film which tends to underplay comedy in favor of a still greater show of blood whatever the case if you are a fan of the story this is the legendary broadway show on tour and it is a knock out recommended gft amazon reviewer,1
8567,so you ve got a number of models on an island and one by one they re picked off agatha christie style we get somebody lost at sea pushed off a cliff poisoned by a solvent driven off a cliff blown up etc nothing terribly graphic before any of that starts one woman inexplicably has a dream of a killer in a weird human face mask the owner of the magazine is a sleaze who had an affair and somebody had photos taken of her before she was of age in the end it s all about business or something there s an 80s style montage of a photo shoot most of the bathing suits being one pieces surprisingly a couple are fairly translucent there s camera clicks during the montage where the frame of the camera appears as a white square or rectangle within the picture the photographer is rather bad at framing,0
4893,i am a german student so sorry for eventually mistakes i m working on it the stylistic very interesting converted and with effective sound effects accentuated platitudinous action of the drama deflect in no way from the horrible bad actors insincere and unnatural moves and expressions of feelings and makes so the relatively weird and senseless story less better just the typical slasher genre with in this case very odd action many by plays destroy partly the main story and let the viewers up to the end into the dark create weirdness and let surmise the senses of actions and the point mere hazily for sure its an hit for slasher fans but not for me but although the interesting style of cinematography and adeptly use of light is turned out well so not the best one,0
22639,western union is something of a forgotten classic western perhaps the reason for this lies in the fact of its unavailability on dvd in the united states however all is not lost as it has now appeared on region 2 in england this being a blessing in some ways is not only incongruous but totally ironic when one considers that a movie depicting the founding and establishment of such a uniquely american organization as the western union telegraph company is without a region 1 release it beggars belief it simply doesn t make sense produced by fox in 1941 western union was directed by fritz lang this was only the second occasion the great german director undertook to direct a western he had done an excellent job the year before with fox s the return of frank james and would have only one more western outing in 1952 with the splendid rancho notorious lang was no ford or hawks but with western union he turned in a fine solid western that holds up very well beautifully photographed in early three strip technicolor by edward cronjager it boasted a good cast headed by robert young randolph scott and dean jagger the female lead is taken by virginia gilmore who really has little to do in the picture an actress who never made anything of her career her presence here is merely cosmetic it is curious that robert young has top billing over scott it is clearly scott s picture from the very beginning when we first see him in the film s terrific opening scene being chased by a posse across the plains young doesn t have much to do throughout the movie and seems out of place in a western he just looks plain silly going up against barton mclane in a gunfight an actor who never really distinguished himself except perhaps with crossfire 1947 young appeared in a string of forgettable romantic comedies in the forties and fifties culminating with his greatest success when for seven years he was tv s marcus welby md in the seventies he died in 1998 at the age of 91 western union recounts the connection by telegraph wire of omaha and salt lake city scott plays a reformed outlaw hired by western union boss dean jagger to protect the line from marauding sioux and to also take on mclane and his gang who are trying to destroy the line for their own devious ends robert young is the young engineer from back east who joins the company and vies with scott for the affections of miss gilmore some comic relief is provided by and irritatingly so some would say by slim summerville and john carradine turns up in a meager role as the company doctor altogether though a spanking good western albeit on region 2 but in sparkling good quality that fans will be delighted with my only crib is that there are no extras not even a trailer and that terrible cover with those dull graphics ugh footnote interestingly the associate producer on western union was harry joe brown who later with randolph scott would create a partnership that would produce some of scott s finest westerns in the fifties,1
24602,i have been away from istanbul for the last 10 years during that time i constantly lived in london when i have seen the movie i realised how much i am istanbuler i am not just from turkey i am a part of turkey one of my part is istanbul the sound of the istanbul the people of the istanbul probably faith akin thought that he has done great musical documentary but i must say it is more than that it is about putting nice blend of vastly different musics cultures approaches politics ethnics into a delicious pot as we all know turkey to be precise istanbul is always comes and goes between being eastern or western city as one of the band member said istanbul is a bi cultural city but much more a eastern city because we always tried to be a western city it shows we ve never been one this movie will catch from very first second music is excellent people are fascinating especially aynur and sezen aksu singers band members it is nice to see you all at a small cinema in wood green,1
14402,this typical teenagers movie is one of the best beside the story is good the music is well accompany the movie all along although i do not enjoy classic movie unless it is classic and better written script this one is exceptional maybe the hair style and language should be change a bit in the 80 s i believe offensive language is still rarely heard,1
24692,if you have not seen this late 80s film about the the washington bureau of a network news station than i highly recommend it it is a sad commentary on the direction of news reporting in this country but tells the story with wit the characters are well developed and albert brooks performance is fabulous he delivers all his lines with entertaining understated comedy i am not an albert brooks fan at all so this was a welcome surprise i have a friend who works as a producer for a local news station and he advised that this is close to reality so kudos to the films writer and director for doing their research fun movie with a lot of insight into the world of network news it is not nearly as dark as another movie i also recommend in the same genre network,1
21976,as a reviewer has already commented this made for tv comedy is up there amongst the best football parodies ever but having failed to video it when it was first aired i now find that it isn t around in any format ok so this has only polled 17 votes to date but a 9 average does seem to suggest something special basically i suppose it s a case of tough luck if you missed it cos it s no longer available to view aaaaaaaargh,1
9914,as much as i love ellen barkin who is really underrated i have to boo this movie if you can t tell who did it and why in the first half hour you obviously have never seen a psycho sexual thriller or have never watched 20 20 it s like the filmmakers and actors didn t care that they way they were shooting it and they way they were playing the characters would be a dead giveaway overall this movie serves to turn on the dirty perverts who like to mix violence and sex not a fun movie to sit through although if you like ellen barkin it s nice to see her place a tough lady,0
12579,i watch lackawanna blues every time it comes on it brings back happy times for me i grow up in a big city in the mid west it reminds me of when i was a child although my situation was a little different it feels the same it makes me wonder if all we will ever know about families are lost the big mama s of day are under the age of 55 will they see know what it takes to be a inspiration to other i hope that i was not the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to their past the music was great in this movie i truly felt like this should have gone to the theaters i would have paid to see it as i viewed the movie for the second time i figured out who life this movie was about he did an superb job in writing and producing this film i guess who better to produce a film based on your life other than you as soon as i can i will be obtaining a copy for my home use i alway enjoy black producer or directors they make such film feel like you were actually living in the time right than thanks for such a great movie,1
5644,phoned work sick watched this in bed and it was so awful i would have went back to work if i could have gotten out of bed the dog ran off with the remote so i was stuck i m positive hammer was grooming the eldest daughter to become his beeeatch horrendous to watch made me vomit more than what i was doing anyway so there you have it this would be the film that they play in the waiting room of hell before you go in or maybe your stuck in the film for all eternity with the hart kids just remember to take a gun with you,0
22174,this film is probably the best new french film i ve seen in this century so far there have been some great ones including noe s irreversible green s le pont des arts and hadzihalilovic s innocencebut none of them come close to les amants reguliers timeless glory the movie is a description of the events of may 68 and what followed in the wake of it and furthermore it is and update of and a homage to the nouvelle vague movies of those days concerning the depiction of the riots in paris the movie is meticulously accurate i m only 19 and i wasn t there myself but you know what i mean and the almost real time and very long riot scenes set the stage perfectly for the aftermath of the events in the streets of paris the riots are not glorified or beautifully photographed like the ones in bertolucci s the dreamers to which the movie is comparable in many ways instead they are filmed in grimy black and white shots courtesy of the excellent william lubtchansky the love story that is the movie s main concern after the riots in 68 is filmed in stunning and far less blurred shots and manages to evoke true feelings of love and adolescent confusion in the midst of the otherwise politically concerned and seemingly cold environment this film is a beautiful love story and it radiates through it that the director wants to depict his own experiences of those mythical late 60 s which makes the film all the more compelling but the film is also a homage to the whole nouvelle vague canon much of the dialogue evokes early truffaut and the length and non action and plot less structure is reminiscent of eustache or rivette there are even godard like verfremdung effects with the persons looking directly into the camera and even addressing bernardo bertolucci directly this film is no doubt an answer song to bertolucci s the dreamers and it is also a nouvelle vague homage but still it stands by itself as a beautiful and radiant love story bottom line this movie is incredible and if you love french cinema you shouldn t sleep on it it may be the finest french film since eustache s la mamain et la putain,1
19395,in my opinion national velvet is one of the top family classic s of all time it features mickey rooney as mi taylor and elizabeth taylor as velvet brown velvet wins a race horse named pie in a raffle she falls in love with it right away with the help of mi an ex jockey they train it to race in the grand national s after the jockey who was scheduled to race pie backs out at the last moment mi convinces velvet to take his place this was a well put together motion picture fine storyline and top notch acting the inner play between elizabeth and mickey was magical this is a wonderful family picture expertly directed by clarence brown the photography is stunning this is a movie you will enjoy for years to come this picture is what made elizabeth taylor a household name both mickey and elizabeth remained close after the film they still send post cards to each other after all these many years one side note elizabeth loved the horse pie so much that the studio gave it to her,1
17459,for many the hit series was ten years of pitch black humour loaded with affectionate parodies of classic films and a hilarious assortment of over a hundred characters with instantly recognisable catchphrases few shows have survived transition from radio to tv to stage show to film but the league of gentlemen have achieved it with suitable aplomb the talented writer performers had initially envisioned a monty python style medieval adventure but as soon as writing began they soon realised that the characters they have lived with had become very real and deserved better with that the royston vasey folk realise their very existence is under threat as the writers decide to disregard the fictitious town and work on a 17th century romp instead with the exception of michael sheen playing much unseen league member jeremy dyson the league play pretty unlikeable caricatures of their real life personae as well as the familiar faces of tubbs i made a little brown fishy nightmare inducing sexual predator herr lipp butcher hilary briss and an unlikely hero irate businessman geoff tibbs new faces appear when the third reality appears it s here we are treated to charming and funny cameos from veteran actors and popular tv stars for many this will be a really enjoyable 90 minutes apocalpse is not going to please everyone though working on this level of post modernism has been done a few times before now and may seem all too familiar to audiences raised on irony drenched teen successes kick started by the likes of wes craven having a new nightmare it also takes a lot of confidence in an audience to keep up with a high concept story so there are moments of exposition and dialogue that serve only to confirm what most in the audience already know comedy as a genre is formulaic but it s now unheard of for a british film not to fall back on the huge back catalogue of tv stars to fill short amounts of screen time it s also hard to believe the creators ever wanted their offspring killed off which is perhaps why some of the role reversal doesn t always quite hit the mark would hilary briss have wanted to try save royston vasey in the series however while the show s deliciously dark vein has almost all but disappeared but is arguably more accessible for it much will be said about the character development and efforts to humanise the likes of previously one joke incarnations like herr lipp it is here an impossible level of depth can be found along with a harsh streak of biting satire and throwaway put downs sentiment is there with a lump in the throat but not sugar coated thickly enough to intrude on the action the music is good performances exemplary and the animation is wonderfully seamless a nice throwback to terry gilliam and ray harryhausen s work in short there s a lot to like about the apocalypse like so many tv to film transfers it was never going to be easy finding the line between preaching to the converted and introducing the uninitiated to the league s slick and distinct voice but no matter what your preference is this last trip to the town which you ll never leave is oddly lined with hope and ultimately very very touching,1
21954,spoilers spoilers there must have been something in the air in the immediate postwar years that made night cities attractive settings for movies a gaggle of nocturnal urban films were made at that time and not just in america one of the most notable was carol reed s odd man out an english picture about a wounded gunman staggering through the streets of belfast in america it was the high noon or more properly high midnight of film noir crossfire isn t really film noir but has the trappings of noir though it uses them for its own aims which have to do with bigotry directed by edward dmytryk written by john paxton it was adapted from a novel by richard brooks the book concerned the murder of a homosexual in the movie the victim is changed to a jew though filmed like a mystery there is little suspense in the film as it is fairly obvious who the murderer is early on what makes the film so watchable and beautiful is its evocation of a city washington d c just after world war ii by some of the most gifted craftsmen working in films at that time unlike many night movies crossfire is set mostly indoors in police stations rooming houses and all night movie theaters soldiers are everywhere in the film and most are itching to get back to their civilian lives yet one senses from most of the men we meet that their personalities have been so shaped by their military experience it s going to be tough for them to return to their old neighborhoods for some maybe even impossible they seem more bound to one another than to anything or anyone else yet some men never truly bonded with anyone in the military the murderer monty is one such individual one senses that he was never connected in his civilian life either he is a lone wolf who also needs people desperately alone he has a sadistic streak a mile wide and always needs someone nearby to be the butt of his jokes the man he kills did him no harm and was in fact a stranger to him but once monty figured out the man s religion that was enough he didn t really mean to kill the guy as it was his intent to merely humiliate him and just beat him up but as he was quite drunk at the time monty s fists got the better of him it is this act that sets the story the story in motion once the movie builds up a head of steam the other characters come rapidly into focus monty s opposite number is keely another soldier who though introspective like monty and somewhat detached harbors no resentment toward anyone and seems a reasonable even amiable guy finley the pipe smoking homicide detective is dandyish and a tad effete compared to the men in uniform but proves more than a match for the various and mostly recalcitrant soldiers he deals with the actors who plays these roles roberts ryan mitchum and young give excellent performances each in a different key ryan as monty is tense and paranoid always looking around for someone to pick on and one can feel his anxiety over becoming a victim himself as keely mitchum is low key almost nonchalant he never raises his voice and he seems to have more to say more to offer than is permitted by the script young s performance has often been criticized as being too soft but i find it deceptively strong and nicely offbeat he cuts against the stereotype of the hardboiled cop and makes the character of finley a bit of a prince of crime detection there are few surprises in crossfire though the script is at times surprisingly well written even brilliant character actor paul kelly gives one of the best short performances in the movies as the boyfriend of a woman a soldier picks up in a bar kelly may or may not be her husband and he may or may not live with her though he seems relaxed enough in her apartment the beauty of these scenes are that nothing is made clear and this man himself seems more than a little confused over what his role is was or ought to be in a way these few scenes form the thematic core of the film which is anomie with the exception of the detective all the men in the film are drifting aimless and basically lost some more seriously than others in this respect crossfire is for all the preaching near the end a film about the vagueness of identity and how easily it can be lost or warped men drift from one bar to another in this film as they engage in a sort of woozy camaraderie their personalities merging into a kind of general american male template then something happens something is nailed down a word is mentioned whether jew or hillbilly and things suddenly turn tense and the very notion of individuality of an identity outside the group of anyone not like them becomes deeply offensive even loathsome then after tempers flare and whatever stirred them up has been resolved or forgotten the men revert to their loose non personal group normality and order is restored,1
17106,i recently stumbled across a tv showing of passion having missed the opening scenes ms currier in to be praised for having the vision and courage to bring such a strange de balzac tale to the screen i am grateful to the entire cast and crew for their parts in producing such a thoroughly fine motion picture it must have been arduous shooting so many scenes in the desert and i cannot comprehend how her trainer coaxed such a fine performance from the leopard simoon this adverture calls to mind another suspenseful adventure naked prey why isn t this film more well known hope i can find it on video,1
14923,i ve lost count of the times i have seen this movie but i love it and find it very funny each time i see it the facial expressions slapstick humor and the timing on the jokes makes it great the characters especially nitro sonar and stepanik are hilarious i thought kelsey grammar rip torn and bruce dern did a great job in fact i think this movie was perfectly cast i think it does need to be released in dvd before i wear my vhs version out,1
4869,i didn t like underdog i mean it was really unnecessary and needed a big face lift and then it would have been maybe passable but for the main part i didn t like it this wasn t like any other kid movie its one of those movies that wanted parents who grew up watching the cartoon to come with there kids to come see this i am neither of them so the film didn t appeal to me in the slightest i had some problems with it like i don t think jason lee was the right voice for underdog it made it him sound sloppy and really unintelligent then it was really predictable which makes you feel tired and mad the humor was really what made me mad it was just to unfunny and somewhat pathetic the one thing that bothered me the most thought was how almost everything out of underdog s mouth was sarcastic or rude the acting was passable but needed a little improvement if you have kids they might enjoy it but if your not a kid by all means see it you might like it unlike me 3 4 stars out of 10,0
5745,ever notice how so many really bad films attract so many 10 10 votes not much of a riddle how that happens but this is not much of a film there are two ways of looking at it being given away in the mail on sunday 1 it s free so you can t complain about it to much 2 it s free so it can t be much good my vote is number 2 the free dvd in the sunday papers things is a recent trend and some great old movies have been given away they re ones that have been out for ages and have made most of the money they ll ever make so it s a case of anything else is a bonus it s the last stop for old films not the first for new ones so you can guess how bad this must be to skip tv and dvd rental the plus points are that vinnie jones does try hard and derek jacobi is good as dickens the minus points are a longer list trying isn t the same as succeeding for poor vinnie and jacobi s other tramp character is talkative ham that s gone off the story is very weak the dickens story does not have anything to do with the film s murders and feels like another movie slapped onto the script to make people think it s a british dan brown without the religion the supporting cast are either there for the money vanessa redgrave must be really hard up or because they are friends or girlfriends of the filmmakers it is also very very long for what it is vinnie taking his priceless dickens story with him in his jacket pocket everywhere is good for a couple of laughs but that s it not funny and very not good even for free,0
1148,technically abominable with audible pops between scenes and awesomely amateurish flesh requires a lot of patience to sit through and will probably turn off most viewers but the dialogue rings amazingly true and joe dallesandro who exposes his body in almost every scene also gives an utterly convincing performance a curio to be sure but the more polished trash made two years later is a definite step forward i suggest you watch that instead 1 2,0

11486,fairly appalling enterprise suggests welsh to be an infantile artist helplessly drawn to the violent milieu he knows best but unable to resist vacuous elaborations rooted in banal fantasy the first story is a ham fisted meaningless trudge with a b movie sci fi premise the second achieves some poignancy but only via the outrage inducing surplus of humiliation visited on its central character the third and most risible seems to aspire to being a dislocated sequel to child s play the direction is consistently clueless all whirling sound and fury a slave to the extreme unpleasantness of the environment suffocating in an ill chosen music score and in indifferently flashy acting this is sheer stupidity masquerading as a guerilla sensibility as arbitrary and hollow as the abstract images that link the three sections,0
6981,considering the film s reputation as truly the worst of the worst i was looking forward to watching wood s crappus opus my word it s not necessarily any more inept than the other woods i ve watched however being from the reefer madness 1938 school of film making glen or glenda doesn t come across as readily enjoyable as his genre efforts also this surely emerges as horror legend bela lugosi s nadir his first of three collaborations with the director one wonders whether he was really aware what kind of film it was considering the actor s history of heavy medication and the sheer senselessness of his cameo besides lugosi s idiosyncratic delivery is perhaps at its most awkward here though wood s script is mostly to blame for this given the impossible dialogue with repeated nonsensical allusions to puppy dog tails and big fat snails he handed the ailing star by the way wood himself plays the central role under the pseudonym daniel davis and being just as worthless in this area proves to have been an all round dog dolores fuller his wife and co star was similarly untalented she would also appear in jail bait 1954 but at the very least the image where the latter finally lets glen wear her angora sweater did give tim burton s affectionate biopic ed wood 1994 its famous poster incidentally the latter film features a presumably fictionalized meeting between wood and orson welles well for all intents and purposes glen or glenda constitutes ed wood s citizen kane 1941 given its gleeful propensity for gimmicky narrative techniques in fact the barest thread of plot is padded with stock footage galore many of it irrelevant such as the bewildering instances of s m and inane dream sequences highlighted by the presence of an impish demon sporting outrageous bushy eyebrows that would make martin scorsese weep with envy the film s sincere attempt at a plea for tolerance and psychological probing into the affliction phenomenon of transvestism is however sabotaged at every turn by the sheer amateurishness of the approach for what it s worth the edition i watched was the extended re issue version which included six minutes of depraved footage directed by w merle connell censored on original release furthermore my copy went out of synch every so often which forced me to rewind it slightly to get the audio back on track though thankfully this was the fault of the source conversion to divx as opposed to the film itself,0
13357,this movie deserves a 20 10 if i could give one the hollow is a great hercule poirot novel and the twist at the end fools most people i am overjoyed that this movie stayed completely faithful to the novel there was no major difference that i could spot the only difference was that poirot was introduced into the story earlier that in the novel the acting was superb and the music as usual was amazing quality david suchet is perfect in his role and the rest of the cast is perfect in their respective roles either in no other movie that i ve seen so far has poirot been portrayed so brilliantly hats off to the producers they have made a movie that i along with many others will cherish for a long time to come,1
23034,while some of the things in haggard are dumb and unnecessary the overall package is good haggard follows ryan dunn and his friends valo bam margera and falcone brandon dicamillo trying to win back glauren jenn rivell ryan s ex the story is followed and developed surprisingly well it doesn t wonder off and become an episode of jackass or viva la bam although it does have a side story which doesn t hurt the main story and for all the bam fan boys and girls there are multiple sequences of bam skateboarding perhaps the weakest aspect of the film phil makes 2 surprisingly small appearances even don vito got a bigger but pointless roll if you are hoping to see a comedy and escape bam s craziness then stay away from this movie otherwise enjoy the time you spend with it if you can find it there are some truly funny scenes in this film,1

11120,since i d bought the dvd i watched as much of this as i did out of a sense of obligation to my wallet the plot has kirk douglas as a successful first novelist who hired laraine day as a secretary falls in love and marries her complications ensue douglas is usually thought of as an intense actor given to heavily dramatic roles sometimes hero sometimes rat he s not bad in this thoroughly comic part the problem is that the part isn t particularly comic and neither is anything else the plot rambles on a dozen quirky characters come and go most prominently keenan wynn as douglas s friend who does nothing but make wry comments thelma ritter was better at this sort of thing well if the plot is weak it could still have been rescued by some sparkle in the dialog but there is none to speak of some gags are silly others don t clear that bar here s what i thought of as an amusing line douglas has just hired day and wants to get her down to the beach house and seduce her day is disturbed and remarks that she s never heard of a writer working in a beach house wynn asks if she liked douglas s previous book last year s love yes of course she did well most of last year s love was done in the beach house ha ha nice cast including support but a failed comedy there have been better sitcoms on television,0
7409,this was a movie that could have been great if there were not so many unnecessary historical inaccuracies and if the actors had been chosen or made up to look a little more like the real persons not very difficult sissi did not go to mayerling to see her dead son she also did not die in the street they carried her on to the boat and then back to the hotel which was much more dramatic i am not sure about the wedding night but i find it exaggerated that a lady in waiting would undress the empress and leave her completely naked and that in the 1850 s or that the emperor would announce very proudly yes i finally laid her to the assembled court as far as i know this was done right away on the first night and nobody rewarded her as if she were a streetwalker the saving grace of the movie is really stephane audran excellent actress and true to character,0
16191,a nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island that keeps many of the novel s characteristics i think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie one thing i didn t like at all though is that the main characters like mandras and pelagia s father weren t greek actors but foreigners i mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living but to me they didn t succeed and it was quite clear even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the film s plot irene papas was really great in her role a typical example of a mother living in a island during the 40 s who has lost her husband and tries to live a child alone john hurt pelagia s father also acted great he reminded me a greek in many of his reactions,1
7421,this film is far and wide and beyond any shadow of a doubt the single worst and most contemptible film in the history of the universe it really is that bad personally i have always enjoyed the guilty pleasure of a terrible film and rented this one thinking it would be one of those to my immense disappointment it was not the script is delivered in a way that sounds as if they re reading the lines directly off placards the story makes absolutely no sense whatsoever and the actual film looks like it was shot on a home video camera i couldn t even finish watching it it is even worse than witch academy and that s quite a feat in itself i cannot even begin to fathom how a director could shoot this film and then still have the sense to believe it was decent enough to release painful awful horrendous,0
8666,well i watch tons of movies and this one really sucked big time i am sure we are all sick and tired of the low budget ploy to make vampire movies using some martial arts teacher turn actor type of movies i am also so tired of the guy knowing some form of fighting technique and then able to fight his way through a somewhat boring movie i forced myself to watch it and one of the main reasons were that the lead actress is quite pretty ha ha well i hope this helped a bit and if you have time and want to give your brain a rest watch it well hopefully one day this type of movies will not be released but then hey where will all the low budget actors go the movie also contains many bloops but that i will leave to you to find because it adds quite a bit of fun while watching and also if you a bit of a perfectionist it will bother you cheers,0
12438,back in 1994 the power rangers had become a huge franchise and t v executives at the usa network were hoping to get in on the action and came up with the tattooed teenage alien fighters from beverly hills in which the evil emporer gorganus who looks like he s wearing a home made darth vader costume and his talking bird that looks like a rubber dog chew toy come to earth to invade it using giant monsters that look like rejects from a 1970 s godzilla film fortunately nimbar an alien that looks like a giant piece of clear jello recruits four teenagers to defend the earth nimbar gives them each a tattoo of a different star constellation that allows them to transform into buffed up superheros who look like dancers from an eighties tech no music video they could also combined into a giant knight forty episodes were made the usa network clearly did not have the money to try to adapt a show from japan like power rangers did and made up this show on their own using the budget of a 1950 s scifi film the fights scenes are generic the special effects are poor and some of the sets look like they could fall down the actors pretty much realized how ridiculous the show was and pretty much ham it up and overact i can only imagine their shock when the show was cancel led,0
23144,kramer vs kramer is a near heartening drama about shocking drastic augmentations of the two subjects of a failed married couple meryl streep in the throes of her trademark maternal sensitivity plays an unhappy stay at home mother who feels confined to such a role and within the first five minutes of the film leaves her inattentive husband in a fantastic performance by dustin hoffman to find another role for herself hoffman is dumbstruck having absolutely no idea what to do with himself having taken so much for granted that he doesn t know the first thing about getting his son to school in the morning hoffman seamlessly characterizes this husband as such a juicy load of setbacks he is restless relentless and impatient but even though the positive side to those three adjectives should include just the opposite he is unremittingly fixated on whatever he turns his head to he s been focused on his career in advertising and when he is left to raise his son billy all by himself chaos ushers in immediately he s the one throwing temper tantrums and quitting angrily halfway through an activity after awhile as he befriends his neighbor and joanna s former friend played by sexy jane alexander hoffman cools his jets enough to understand why his wife left in the meantime his boundless energy redirects towards raising billy and he loses his job the custody battle of the title is a brilliantly grey circumstance even if the ending is a little unmotivated subjectified for the audience the last line and the last shot still have that witty screen writing touch that seemed to diminish after the magical 1970s,1
17627,i just recently bought the big trail 1930 it s an awesome amazing film i knew it by reputation but never expected it to be so magnificent my version is the one shot in 35mm and i ll speak of that again later when one thinks of the western myth in film the names that come to mind are john ford and john wayne well you have only half the team here but the entire myth is present raoul walsh has given us a remarkable epic in which the true plot is the struggle of the westward expansion of the nation there is a plot centering on a romance between breck coleman wayne and ruth cameron margaret churchill with the main villain red flack being memorably played by tyrone power sr but this has an almost incidental quality as the wagon train struggles forward against incredible obstacles both natural and human examples are the crossing of the river the indian battle and traversing the burning desert the aftermath of the battle is given a sombre touch when a doll is placed on the grave of a child killed while a faithful dog lies down on its master s grave magnificent panoramas are filled with energy and activity the opening scene as the wagon train prepares to leave the square dance interlude and the great buffalo herds are some that spring to mind marvellous use is made of location shooting throughout another feature of this splendid film is the fact that men and women are given equal credit for their parts in the great struggle westward women work fight and confront the terrible hardships with the same fortitude and strength as their male counterparts the finale has a powerfully uplifting experience as coleman and cameron meet in the gigantic towering sequoia forest to start their new life the acting is quite acceptable throughout i ve already mentioned tyrone power s scene stealing performance tully marshall is excellent as coleman s sidekick and marguerite churchill convincingly portrays a woman who develops an inner strength as she encounters her own problems as well as those external to herself the comic relief is the weakest aspect of this film but these scenes are not common and are swallowed up in the tremendous sweep of the film i ve read much criticism of wayne s performance some even going so far as to blame his wooden acting for the failure of the film at the box office i think this is unfair wayne was in his first major role and certainly had not developed the charisma of his performance in stagecoach but he still does a serviceable job in a role which is certainly going to play second fiddle to the great over arching theme after the big trail wayne played in a large number of low budget b westerns i have a number of these and one can see the developing actor in them when stagecoach came he was ready for it and the big trail was a significant part of that apprenticeship i mentioned earlier that my version is the one shot in 35mm it s still impressive but to get some idea of the effect of the 70mm version i set the tv screen to 16 9 which doesn t cause any distortion while not having the complete effect of the grandeur version it was good enough to make me want to get the latter in addition the film shot in 70mm has a few extra scenes not in the form made for ordinary theatrical showing all in all this film deserves to be in any list of the greatest westerns ever made,1
1678,stinger starts 3 months ago on the submarine the ss newark where genetic experiments have gone awry the crew member are brutally slaughtered by large killer scorpions jump to camp pendleton a couple of months later where general ashford james cagnard brief s lieutenant williams john miranda on his mission to board the newark assist genetic scientist dr carly ryan michelle meadows before anyone knows it a group of corporate scientists marines are on board the newark are shocked to discover he mutilated corpses of the crew apart from dr mike thompson casey clark who doesn t make much sense it s not long before the scorpions attack first to fall is lt williams so sergeant sam harmon christopher persson is promoted takes the responsibility to get everyone to safety end the menace of the giant scorpions forever this sweedish america co production was directed by martin munthe he also handled the cinematography i thought this was a strictly by the numbers uninspiring creature feature it s early into the new year stinger is the first giant genetically mutated monster creature insect type film i ve seen in 2007 hopefully things can only get better the script by mat nastos is incredibly clich d gets all of it s ideas from other films most notably aliens 1986 lets see there s the isolated location in this case being a submarine there s the hastily assembled team of marines including one who chews on a cigar throughout the entire film there s the scientists including a blonde sweedish one to try explain it all the evil money grabbing corporate villain who puts the mighty dollar above human life the final ingredient being the monster alien insect or whatever in this case there s loads of large scorpions running around but they re not utilised in any sort of unique or imaginative way so they might as well have been killer grasshoppers yeah it s all here unfortunately stinger isn t an aliens if you get what i mean it s a touch long at over 100 minutes it s throughly predictable although it moves along at a reasonable pace as a dumb creature feature you could do worse despite what many say on the imdb director munthe doesn t distinguish himself it s not scary there s a lack of atmosphere the action scenes are dull unexciting there s not many scorpion attacks it s almost an hour before any significant action occurs the special effects are at the bottom end of the scale but i have seen worse that s for sure i mean that s not to say the effects in stinger are good but i ve seen worse there isn t much blood or gore there s some mutilated bodies some decapitated heads someone is ripped in half the only clever amusing moment in the entire film is when the naked sweedish female scientist ask s her lover to turn her on by talking about all the money their going to make from the scorpions however there was a moment which had me groaning tearing my hair out in it s stupidity as a bloke tries to repair the submarine s circuitry get the lights working by hitting the power supply computer boards with a hammer it works as well technically stinger is average at best there s the usual endless amount of dark corridors which gets monotonous stinger was shot in stockholm in sweeden if your interested the acting was poor there s nothing else to say stinger isn t a great film it isn t a great horror film either i can t recommend it at all but i ve seen worse if you liked stinger unlikely you might like the similarly themed giant scorpions on the loose films tail sting 2001 or scorpius gigantus 2006 just as unlikely,0
12856,in the 60 s 70 s david jason was renowned for his many supporting roles in television comedies such as do not adjust your set hark at barker and the doctor series it was in 1974 that he landed his first leading role in london weekend television s the top secret life of edgar briggs written by richard laing bernard mckenna edgar briggs is a secret agent of the s i s secret intelligence service he genuinely tries to do his job well but always seems to mess things up astonishingly enough though he always succeeds in getting to the bottom of cases much to the amazement of his colleagues buxton michael stainton spencer mark eden and cathy the lovely elisabeth counsell all of which answer to the commander noel coleman briggs is married to jennifer barbara angell a woman who much like michele dotrice s betty from some mother s do ave em has the patience of a saint and stands by her hare brained but well meaning husband no matter what like some mother s do ave em and the baldy man t t s l o e b was laced completely with slapstick each episode saw jason perform stunts such as plummeting from a high window sill or falling from the top of a ladder while decorating his flat it was custard pie in the face stuff really edgar briggs was not a big hit due to poor scheduling from i t v a shame as it was an amusing and enjoyable show well served by its star and the fine support cast the leading man though did not seem to enjoy the experience of the show david jason vetoed repeat screenings of the show because he felt his acting in it was non refined granted the david jason who played del boy inspector frost and pop larkin is way different to the one that played briggs but by no means was his acting unrefined most actors would have turned briggs into a ridiculous caricature but jason s performance made briggs a credible realistic figure odd perhaps but not unimaginable jason s next vehicle was lucky feller in which he played mummy s boy shorty mempstead it too failed to make the ratings his lucky break came in the shape of a t v s a sharp intake of breath in which he played walking disaster area peter barnes for four series between 1977 1981 so while not outstanding as such briggs is an easy and worthwhile watch nice james bond style theme tune too,1
9510,not as bad as billy bathgate but close try as he might warren beatty just could not be believed as bugsy whenever he flipped out instead of being shocked by the violence i found it pretty embarrassing because it was so phony the other actors don t fare as well either annette bening just doesn t have what it takes to play seductive women she is better off with safe characters as many have noted joe mantegna would have fared better if the script had him as a more believable george raft only harvey keitel emerged unscathed but then again this guy can do these movies in his sleep and robert beltran with just one line steals one of the big beatty bening scenes with these films i m never sure if the director is intent on making the mobsters seem like normal businessmen or if it just comes out that way either way i don t like it these guys were killers and no matter how much las vegas is indebted to bugsy siegel i don t think that a movie should be made glorifying the guy especially one with a big studio backing,0

20879,inglorious basterds is a dark and violent comic fantasy gloriously so built on the framework of the dirty dozen inglorious basterds ditches the elongated training sequences of the dirty dozen to plunge into the action right away in the process tarantino fixes one of the dirty dozen s major flaws by giving the bad guys screen time to remind us just how bad the nazis were the nazis with the most screen time end up becoming the most completely human characters in the film which ironically makes them even worse monsters bu ditching the training sequences tarantino is also able to give us a picture of the entire war showing us not only british american and german soldiers but also giving us glimpses into the world of french and german civilians both collaborators and resistance it goes without saying that any tarantino film is going to have fantastic dialogue but when tarantino made the decision to have the french characters speak french and the germans speak german beyond adding a level of authenticity tarantino also somehow ensured that his dialogue in french was as sharp and funny and clever as his english dialogue case in point during the opening sequence the nazi jew hunter ss colonel hans landa christian waltz is interrogating french dairy farmer perrier lapadite denis menochet landa suspects that lapadite is hiding a family of jews while subtly pressuring lapadite landa asks for a glass of milk after greedily gulping it down landa compliments lapadite on his daughters and his cows votre famille et vos vaches je dis bravo the thing of it is in french vache means cow but it is also a vulgar name for the vagina if reprimanded for this vulgar pun landa could quite convincingly claim not to understand french well enough to have meant it that way but landa does mean it that way and he means it as a threat and lapadite understands his meaning all too well that is a really subtle piece of acting and word play that many audiences would never catch or at least they might understand the subtext without knowing the exact nature of the threat the film is rich with that kind of detail all of the french and english dialogue is chosen with that same attention to detail and while i can t swear to the german i would suspect that it shows a similar level of craft inglorious basterds opens with the phrase once upon a time in nazi occupied france personally this reminds me of the opening of every asterix book and movie another comic fantasy in a war torn occupied france like asterix inglorious basterds is howlingly funny in places although the film also turns darkly serious in its more serious moments inglorious basterds reminds us that the first casualties of war are compassion and the ability to relax as in almost every elongated sequence of the film tarantino finds a new way to build cruel tension to almost unbearable levels tarantino also reminds us that film is dangerous even inflammable and that its power deserves respect if you can see this film as i did in a packed theatre filled with knowledgeable fans who get every joke that you will see this masterful film the way that it was meant to be seen if you are not that lucky all that you will see is a great great film that delivers a darkly funny punch,1
5977,i have to say its not very good polly bergen is fine in this film the rest are so so i m gay and honestly there are so many clich s for this time in history that its just sad we started watching it then turned it off then decided it would be fun to make fun of the rest of the film but all said the basic idea of the film is good if it was re written with less contrived lines and better acting it could have actually been prety good over all i would not recommend it in additon the this is coo coo thinking line is so lame on top of that the fight in the hair salon is funny because its so bad the lesbian sister in the room with them while they are trying to get it on is so weird its sad,0
23213,sergei eisenstein s most famous movie has truly withstood the test of time the story of a mutiny aboard a warship in 1905 does have the feeling of soviet propaganda but does a good job showing the conditions that led to the revolt the scene on the odessa steps should remain seared into anyone s mind okay so the battleship potemkin wasn t actually the first movie to use montage but they did a great job with it here certainly any film history class should show this movie it s a great historical drama although i will admit that i don t know how accurate it is a 10 10 oh and we should have learned by now that potemkin should be transliterated as potyomkin,1

18319,yes this show had a lot of male frontal nudity and yes over the years the plot lines became over the top melodramatic and very unrealistic however it didn t matter because the show is great you really get involved in the characters and every character no matter how minor or major is perfectly cast i can t imagine anyone else except jk simmons play the neo nazi racist rapist leader nor anyone else playing tobias beecher except lee tergesen the transformation of his character from season 1 to season 2 is amazing however the character that made oz oz was chris keller played by christopher meloni he didn t have relations with anyone else in prison except beecher well except ronnie barlog but that was only to get ronnie to stop playing around with keller s lover boy beecher their relationship transcended sexes and tom fontana actually made us care about those two and want those two to be together i loved vern s soft spot for his kids in the show and how fontana made sympathetic characters out of all these heinous criminals that we grew to adore even simon adebesi however some plot lines were totally unbelievable and unrealistic a guy building a bomb in oz guys standing in a spotlight in their windows in their pods looking at other men plotting something in their mind too over the top drugs getting in oz everyone in the rehab group used or sold drugs and sister pete never helped anyone in six years people getting killed in the gym supply closet and kitchen no one hurting ryan s mom no one fighting cyril outside the boxing ring except vern of course two inmates with tools being left alone in the elevator shaft and one of them dying with no investigation karl metzger guard gets killed and no one investigates governor holds all his press conferences at the prison all an inmate needs to do is say i want to see glenn or i want to see mcmanus and they are taken to them no questions asked people die every week in oz on the outside people kill someone and get 20 years up for parole in eight but if they kill someone on the inside they go to death row almost immediately there is no on site paid staff in the kitchen or mail room inmates run both departments no questions asked aging drugs for inmates to substitute as time served ryan has no friends or associates but he never gets hurt killed maimed raped or beaten the guys never flush the toilets when they go to the bathroom or throw up an nba scout comes to the prison to recruit for an nba player yeah right however with all these flaws this show is still awesome it s gruesome brutal sexy edgy raw and innovative dean winters scott william winters jk simmons christopher meloni luiz guzman adele the guy that played simon adebisi eammon walker lee tergesen terry kinney mums male alexander ll cool j etc etc etc all are awesome and made the show worth watching i highly recommend renting this on dvd season six comes out 9 06 next month first five seasons are on dvd watch them and then watch them again with audio commentary i loved the director s commentary with chazz palmentari the sequence with andy schillinger running down the cafeteria tables and then falling into the hole was an awesome top notch shot kudos and kathy bates directing family business and the famous wrestling scene between beecher and keller simply amazing brilliant that d have to be so weird for meloni to touch tergesen s private part in front of an icon like kathy bates in that one scene wow pulled that off beautifully pun intended i m waiting for oz the next generation like with star trek etc c mon let s get it started,1
17168,i enjoyed this movie more than i expected it has enough action intrigue and locations to make it worth your while while i can t quite yet see mark wahlberg as a leader he s gotten good enough to be a credible manager and that s ok the superhero of the movie is the mini cooper it s shown to have the speed dexterity and muscle to pull off any job and to handle a maniac driver like charlize theron s character,1

1122,most lorne michaels films seem to fail because they re essentially just extended versions of skits that barely managed to make people laugh in five minute segments tommy boy is a character right from snl a big fat lovable in their opinion goof who doesn t know anything david spade gets the thankless overwhelmed everyman role he s paired with the annoying overweight slob and they endure miserable misfortunes as they travel cross country to save daddy s business the plot for starters is really faulty the whole premise daddy dies and rich stupid son has to save the family biz can be traced back to just about any movie you want like any snl style film it is reduced to a simple motivation empty shallow just a reason to see a fat guy and a thin guy be funny together the movie s biggest influence is the 1987 comedy classic planes trains automobiles that movie is great because the plot isn t stale and recycled it s basic yeah a guy traveling home for thanksgiving gets stuck with a slob but it s real dammit it makes all the difference the characters are real the situations are far more real tommy boy is pure slapstick and its ridiculous situations undermine the characters we feel nothing for them and we don t care about what s happening on screen pta walked the careful line between outrageous and utterly believable and relate able tommy boy is simply absurd with jokes like a simple deer in the headlights turning into a crash turning into a struggle with a dead deer that really isn t dead then awakens and wrecks their car the whole wrecked car thing is stolen completely from pta and it s eerie how much stuff in this film actually does resemble the steve martin john candy movie farley is simply way too obnoxious to find likable i ve never enjoyed watching him in any movies and this hasn t changed my mind spade s given very little to do serving as the movie s most thankless character dan aykroyd is wasted as the evil baddie who plans to destroy daddy s business the ending is a joke and not in a har har funny way more like a oh god are they serious way some people dig it that s cool but i just can t get into it nor do i appreciate all the stuff it borrows from not just counting pt a without any credit whatsoever,0
3763,this movie about a man on the run for killing a mobster is the kind of film you can watch entirely on fast forward once you know who s who and not lose a thing it has an attractive cast but the plot is a virtual writer s guide to cinema cliche and boy does the dialogue clunk,0

24045,i was very moved by the young life experiences of a man who rose so high in the academic world a hard life surrounded by the love of a close family and extended family of companion workers created a person able to succeed in the world for the most part the hispanic culture is shown as i have always observed and admired hardworking optimistic and truly family oriented the points of religious superstition were quite authentic to the catholic church without a doubt the actress who played the mother deserves an academy award her prayers for her missing son moved me to tears i will recommend this stunningly thoughtful film to my friends and family,1
6090,i am a music lover and was excited to see this movie unfortunately i was disappointed i was ready to walk out half way through the movie i didn t identify with any of the characters which meant that i didn t care what happened to them and lost interest in the story completely on the good side ed harris looked exactly like beethoven and the 9th symphony is always a pleasure to hear so that made part of the film bearable also the parts where they talk about the bridge almost redeemed the entire movie but it couldn t sustain me through to the end the actors did what they could with what they had to work with but the screenplay just wasn t adequate to make it even remotely interesting the bit about wash me was utter rubbish i wonder how many takes the actors had to do on that one i wouldn t be able to say those lines without bursting into laughter anyway such a shame it could have been so much better,0
1059,even with the low standards of a dedicated horror fan i found this film to be beyond awful it was a huge disappointment since it was featured as one of the eight horrorfest films i can only hope the other seven were better i was actually embarrassed for the friends i was able to convince to see this and these are the same friends i made watch the remake of the wicker man it has every clich in the book in fact it went out of its way to include them let s start with the characters instead of one young damsel in distress we get three the single hot mom with two daughters a blossoming yet brainless teenager and a cute yet simultaneously creepy little girl that you just know is going to have special skills including supernatural knowledge and the ability to communicate with the dead the little girl is the same one that was in the remake of the amityville horror she was a little annoying but not nearly as irritating dakota fanning overall these characters seemed like escapees from a lifetime movie i thought perhaps horror movies had moved on from scenes where the female characters go to bed in full makeup and run around in the dark announcing their presence to anyone with ears but not this one i also find it inconceivable that none of them could be bothered to secure the front door from arbitrarily opening day and night to give you an idea about how uninvolved i was with these characters i spent most of my time thinking about how cold it must have been on the set because everyone was in a coat even in their houses and how white their teeth were despite all the formulaic plot machinations the film does not build any suspense at all except to wonder when it will be over there is more atmosphere at the local giant in the middle of the most mundane of weekday afternoons as for the dialogue i could have sampled quotes from ten other films and cobbled together better more believable discourse the gore level the eye candy for a horror fan was minimal at best without their tiny weapons the zombies were not menacing at all you could probably drop kick a couple of them across the room what really kills it is its banality horror films more than any other genre cannot survive uninspired mediocrity give me a horror movie that is comically inept or outrageously over the top with gore i can even take the new ones with their cringe inducing torture every once in a while i d appreciate a truly frightening one anything but this,0
2551,justine cannot find the perfect mate to make her first time the perfect one with geek friend in tow she enters a virtual machine to improve her appearance when she sees the opportunity to create her perfect man an explosion occurs and the results are left to your imagination problem is how many obvious sex jokes are left anymore how predictable can these kind of movies get a few funny moments here and there but nothing too outrageous or different from jokes in other movies or even normal life if you liked weird science or jokes about the fish out of water combined with gender identity crisis then by all means these 90 min you could enjoy,0

3769,this is a very bad movie however i read that it was made by a high school teacher so maybe i should give it at least a tiny bit of praise for it s ambitious yet awful special effects here is the plot a monster emerges from a pile of trash and pollution in the town of milpitas california and embarks on a destructive rampage i m about to spoil the big surprise about what the monster looks like so please read the rest of this at your own risk you have been warned the monster looks sort of like a giant two legged fly wearing a gas mask in some scenes the monster is an actor wearing a costume in other scenes the monster is created by stop motion animation the acting is terrible the dialogue is terrible the special effects are terrible the plot is predictable stay away,0
1816,whereas the movie was beautifully shot and reasonably well acted the script was dull plodding and nothing we have not seen before not once in this film did i ever get the feeling that these people were really in danger no noticeable climax and a very standard resolution i believe these type of movies have been overdone and should be given a rest after all didn t everyone on the planet see schindler s list,0
16922,just to correct something in a previous review here i don t believe this film is only for people who know london it s a case of a very specific situation being used to make universal comments jack rosenthal says in an introduction to the published script that it was meant to be about characters who by going though this gruelling knowledge test gain some measure of self knowledge i think it s one of the most perfectly written dramas i ve seen technically it s supremely adept at conveying quite complex details but it s also joyous in how it involves you at the start you know no more about this london knowledge test than the main characters but you get scooped up right along with them until it s vitally important to you you become tremendously proud of those characters who succeed and you are crushed for those who don t especially one whose downfall without giving anything anyway will make your hands fly to your face also just as a point of fact nigel hawthorne s character mr burgess is called the vampire not dracula you don t need to know this i m not saying it s crucial but it s a measure of the drama once you ve seen this you will want everyone to and you will evangelise about its every detail i hope you get to see it william,1
15842,i ve just finished seeing the film for the first time in it s entirety although i watched some parts when it was first shown in britain in the mid 90 s i truly believe it to be a masterpiece of late twentieth century cinema undoubtledly a film of this scope raises lots of questions like why are there some narrative differences between the 60 s hermann in heimat and hermann in this film for example in the first film hermann has a fairly significant relationship with his stepfather he funds hermann s electronic music whereas in die zweite there is little mention of his dad until the final episode one other point does interest me reading up on edgar reitz i m struck by historical similarities between him and the stefan character spoiler coming in the last episode it is revealed that stefan has won a prize at the venice film festival reitz won an award for best debut work there for his film mahlzeiten reitz s film company is called edgar reitz filmproduktion and stefan s is also eponymously named i m interested in stefan being an autobiographical character because aside from helga he is probably the least likable of the friends maybe stefan s a red herring i don t know what i do know is that i loved this film and wish that more were made like it with the exception of michael haneke s cache and werner herzog s grizzly man there s not enough ambition audacity and passion of this sort in modern cinema i can t wait to see number 3 now,1
7994,circus could have been so much better if they had reduced the number of twists and developed each better the film features a very gifted cast that mostly perform well however it totally loses the audience basically everyone is back stabbing everyone else and not back stabbing them at the same time because they are backstabbing someone else and working with did i lose you well the film is even more confusing clearly written by a first timer writer it has some redeeming qualities though in the acting especially famke janssen shines as lily but sadly gets a lot of useless screen time just standing there doing nothing the dialogue is a bit cheesy and the accents sometimes irritating but its still worth watching if you re a fan of any of the actors especially john and famke who get the most screen time just remember to watch it with a notebook so you can write down who is double crossing who every second,0
9550,i was very interested in seeing this movie despite the article i read about the director in tattler magazine i don t judge movies by what the director may or may not have done this debut feature was very difficult to watch i found the split screens to be a distraction to the drama in the film some of the supporting characters gave bad performances and the film to be a copy of several other films i have seen there really wasn t anything fresh about this,0

4854,this film and the 1st avp film both all over the whole aliens and predator franchise they are awful films badly acted badly scripted and terribly directed they just seem like someones desperate attempt to make money off of the good name of the original aliens and predator films but instead of delivering a well thought out quality production they came up with the predaturd the original alien aliens predator predator 2 films were great they redefined the horror thriller genre by inventing these insane and yet still believable creatures who took the role of the serial killer as opposed to a human these films are just milking the franchise and do nothing but darken its name the aliens vs predator comic books were brilliant and had a great story they were true to the alien predator mythology didn t crap all over the original stories etc why didn t they make the comic book into a great film because hollywood are idiots thats why,0
15112,this movie is such a fine example of the greatness that is 80 s entertainment oh don t get me wrong most of the music back then sucked i only ever liked the metal bands from the 80s bands that had some balls forget that whiny keyboard crap and all that life is horrible and i want to die garbage but the movies from the 80 s are the best they were all about nonsense and just having a good time this movie exemplifies that party get naked get laid woooooohooooo,1
19468,in the future a disparate group of people asleep aboard a commercial spaceship is forced to improvise their survival when the spaceship crash lands on a remote barren planet they already have one problem in that one of the passengers is intense criminal richard riddick vin diesel in his first top billed role however they are soon preyed upon by a strange species of predator that thrives in the darkness and a rare solar eclipse is soon to take place while the script for this movie is ultimately on the routine side it is decently acted and it is especially well made technically location work photography and design production as well as creature design are all very impressive it is not the most original or stimulating science fiction horror picture ever made far from it but it still provides good entertainment diesel is particularly good at getting under the skin of his intimidating character it is not entirely predictable however and gets some points for spoiler having a more politically correct ending than most of its type filmed on location in the desolate coober pedy area of queensland in australia a sequel of sorts is in the works 7 10,1
22615,don t ask me why i love this movie so much maybe it came at a time in my life i desperately wanted to fit in maybe it is the amazing monster effects maybe because i enjoyed the novel cabal but it s probably because i love clive barker i think it s fair to warn you the movie and the novel have no true resolve and like me you ll probably have a wtf moment at the end at least two sequels were planned but never came about due to the fact the movie flopped for a few reasons the studio made drastic cuts to the film cutting a good 30 or so minutes out of it and they did a horrible job promoting it the adverts made it look like just another cheap slasher showing mainly the button face mask decker character this is a movie about the monsters about fantasy about a place called midian it s a story where the monsters are the good guys there is truly nothing else out there like it it s not a movie for everybody i suppose but it stands as one of clive s many great works sit back and be prepared to be taken to midian where the monsters are,1
19718,i have waited for ages to comment on this programme and felt it was about time some justice was done to it this is one of christie s darker more sinister and engaging works not simply someone being killed for money this is a dark and thoroughly engaging tale of mystery intrigue love and murder made all the better by the amendments made by the adaptor the level of acting is utterly superb joan hickson is sublime in the part as always the rest of the cast including the likes of liz fraser anna cropper and helen cherry all perform beautifully but it s my opinion that the show is stolen by margaret tyzack the closing scene between her and joan hickson is simply magical the acting is as good as it gets chilling moving and totally brilliant please let me know if you agree with my words i am seriously looking forward to the remake to see how well geraldine mcewan s version is watch and enjoy,1
14915,look we rated this a 10 on entertainment value it s a comedy sure not an epic like lord of the rings or gone with the wind still for comedy particularly these days it s a 10 not a long movie moves quickly and easily kelsey grammar right at home is this role as a loose but brilliant captain of a diesel sub pitted against the us nuclear navy in a war game designed to see if terrorists could get a nuclear bomb through our defenses kinda ironic this plot pre 911 don t take this topic seriously cause it s mostly laughs from start to finish rob schneider is 2nd in command like frank burns and pulls many laughs all the others are perfect for their parts as well rip torn and bruce dern look plain and simple you got 90 minutes and need a laugh or pick me up and you re not a prude their is some language and innuendo then rent it or buy it we did and enjoy i wish they would make a part 2,1

10209,i pretty much liked every character on this show from the start except reba herself she comes off as an holier than thou type and quite frankly a big bully and that stinks because she is in every scene and every episode in the later seasons van becomes unlikeable too like a spoof of his former self and kyra walks around sneering and being miserable the first 3 to 4 seasons are pretty good if you overlook reba towards the end its pretty bleak in basically every episode barbara jean is walking around being dumb reba is being mean to her but poor ole barbara jean desperately wants reba to like her which results in barabara jean telling reba how awesome she is in every episode i think it is pretty clear to see reba has self esteem issues and wants to be seen as this all forgiving saint its really a shame too because other than her the show had such potential,0

22606,i thought that this movie was incredible i absolutely loved it even though my brothers didn t that much the special effects were outstanding and this movie is about my favorite sport golf the only thing that was disappointing about this amazing movie is that it is hard to watch two times or more in a row this movie just absolutely tops everything else i have ever seen it was everything i would expect out of a movie i just loved it also it was pretty kid friendly this movie helped me realize that when you put your mind to it anything is possible i would give it a pure 10 10 it was better than the legend of baggar vants and the two pirates of the caribbean movies combined absolutely amazing loved it,1
6806,the video case for this film reads a story of beauty passion and forbidden fruit are they talking about the same movie i just saw they can t be as the film i just saw was beautiful but there was no passion and as for the fruit this is all hogwash meant to entice the potential viewer to see this movie if only it did have some passion or some life to it i would have greatly enjoyed this film instead it was an agonizingly slow paced and not particularly interesting film that i would definitely not want to see again it isn t that it s a bad film after all it is very beautifully filmed but it is dull beyond belief i kept waiting for something exciting or interesting to happen but then the movie just ended there was no great sense of excitement mystery or anything just a rather unexciting story about a young girl who becomes a servant and spends the next 10 years of her life working as a maid,0
11636,i did have a good time the first 45 min or so but then suddenly it was all down hill the suspense somewhat started to get thin and the jokes somewhat the same all over what kept it going were the good actors but the problem with this film is that it is trying to be cleverly funny like tarantino and god is that outdated stuff tarantino being a bit overrated sometimes this movie comes ten years too late at best it is for teenagers and i am sure many of them find the character of johann funny which he is for the first 30 min the other problem i have with it is that the story fades away towards the end more and more thou i tried to find a recovery point maybe it didn t recover because the lack of passion comes with the effort of trying to be cleverly funny also like in many movies sure good actors who can afford it don t seem to demand a better dialogue or just turn down the script,0
5811,terrible movie just terrible the start of this movie is like something out of a bad women in prison movie then it moves on to being a b movie version of aliens b movie in this case meaning the addition of gratuitous sex scenes and women in lingerie oh and a lot of the footage is the exact same as used in two other movies by the same company including the women in prison schtick the only thing saving this movie from a 1 10 is that i have actually seen worse movies not many and not much but worse,0
2433,this movie was a rather odd viewing experience the movie is obviously based on a play now i m sure that everything in this movie works out just fine in a play but for in a movie it just doesn t feel terribly interesting enough to watch the movie is way too stagey and they didn t even bothered to change some of the dialog to make it more fitting for a movie instead what is presented now is an almost literally re filming of a stage play with over the top characters and staged dialog because of all this the storyline really doesn t work out and the movie becomes an almost complete bore and obsolete viewing experience it takes a while before you figure out that this is a comedy you re watching at first you think its a drama you re watching with quirky characters in it but as the movie progresses you ll notice that the movie is more a tragicomedy that leans really more toward the comedy genre rather than the drama genre the characters and dialog are really the things that make this movie a quirky and over the top one that at times really become unwatchable sure the actors are great peter o toole and susannah york amongst others but they don t really uplift the movie to a level of watchable enough the story feels totally disorientated basicaly the story is about nothing and just mainly focuses on the brother sister characters played by peter o toole and susannah york but what exactly is the story even about the movie feels like a pointless and obsolete one that has very little to offer like i said before i m sure the story is good and interesting to watch on stage but as a movie it really isn t fitting and simply doesn t work out the editing is simply dreadful and times and it becomes even laughable bad in certain sequences more was to expect from director j lee thompson who has obviously done far better movies than this rather failed stage play translated to screen project really not worth your time 4 10,0
2744,times i look back to high school and it amazes me that i never went lower than marvin did in this bad film poor marv is the main character who s bad luck just gets worse and worse despite his intelligence he manages to get bullied exploited supports his lousy deadbeat dad and plenty more goof ups including a daring heist which let s say doesn t go fully to plan of course the viewer feels no empathy with anyone in this film so all this disastrous gloom bounces off like harmless zeta rays recommended for those days you re feeling down pop this film in and you ll smile and say i m so glad i m not marv,0
17625,i have really nothing to add to all the other comments save this to me the film looked like a silent film slowly being adapted to sound the text boards bringing the story along reinforced that impression i suppose along the way the actors were allowed to leave the stilted theatre like acting marguerite churchill very much looks like a typical early silent movie heroine at the beginning of the film but at the end is allowed finer expressions gus the swede reminded me of the comic characters of shakespeare plays and windy sounded to me like an early donald duck it truly amazed me that it was all filmed outdoors on location and even though the dust of all the wagons horses and cattle obscured the view it must actually have been like that for the real settlers it also was clear to me that many of those indians must have been real and i didn t detect any overt racism towards them and john wayne looks so incredibly young as someone who became a real wayne fan through the cavalry trilogy by john ford and thought that stage coach was wayne s first as a leading star this film was a revelation the plot is very simple again reminding me of a silent film but the grit is very real indeed an amazing film to have been made with that technique and under those conditions in 1930,1
13325,there s hell to pay when you cross nami matsushima meiko kaji female scorpion and a dangerous group of thugs including their sadistic head pimp and his equally repellent lady operating a prostitution ring with an iron fist does just that hell hath no fury like scorpion and a determined detective gondo mikio narita seeking revenge for decapitating his arm after handcuffing her will do whatever it takes and that includes intimidating anyone who might know her whereabouts to catch nami nami finds an ally in hooker yuki yayoi watanabe who provides her a temporary shelter yuki has a retarded brother who suffered a brain injury during a job and must take care of him in a disturbing revelation regarding incest she also provides his sexual needs she in actuality keeps him locked up in a room while working the streets meanwhile nami is targeted by a vile neighbor once she finds a place of her own she works as a sewer and he threatens to turn her into the authorities nami was an escaped convict who fled a subway from the cops if she doesn t supply him sexual favors his wife dumps a tea kettle of boiling water all over his face and body resulting in death the prostitution clan come looking for nami to pay the debt of losing a very important member of their organization that s when katsu reisen lee the pimp s lover and confidant realizes that the one responsible for the loss of their loyal member is a former inmate of hers scorpion subduing her with an injected liquid drug placing her in a bird cage katsu embellishes in her imprisonment what ultimately fuels nami s rage is watching a prostitute die outside her cell a victim of a forced late term abortion left to bleed to death finding a scalpel clutched in her hand from the operation room nami will break free from the cage and prey upon each member of the clan responsible for the hooker s death the series of scalpel murders provide gondo with an opportunity to catch nami and he ll trap her in the underground sewers below the city but can he catch or kill her especially if yuki comes to her aid trust me when i say there was no shackles binding director shunya ito or his film making team because female prisoner scorpion beast stable is yet another perverse deranged and ultra violent entry in the very entertaining series equipped with fine production values and a visually stylistic talent for capturing all of the madness in imaginative ways ito pulls you right or he did me into the twisted drama that always exists when nami matsushima is on screen when you have a protracted opening credits sequence where your anti heroine is fleeing through the crowded city streets with a man s severed arm handcuffed to her the viewer has to know what they re in for the incestuous sub plot is simply bizarre and it s shot in a soft core way with the retarded brother humping his numb cold sister with dead eyes staring ahead and the entire abortion sequence is rather hard to sit through but the abortion angle as disturbing as it is provides motivation for nami s revenge despite nami s imperfect ways and her criminal nature you would rather see her take these cretins out than vice versa interesting angle with detective gondo as well gondo is willing to break the rules and he becomes a force of nature towards anyone who stands in his way of capturing his mortal enemy his fate at the end visiting another enemy of nami s in an isolated cell while she looks on perfectly encapsulates what makes these films so ridiculous yet so entertaining the scalpel murders is a montage of slumping scumbags in various places the blades protruding from flesh with nami leaving the crime scenes very driven to wipe the whole clan out in memory of a fallen victim of unfortunate circumstances while the film is essentially a comic book adventure there s a sadness that permeates and few characters come away without flaws i imagine many will walk away from this scoffing at how unrealistic female prisoner scorpion beast stable is specifically how nami is able to escape capture time and time again accomplishing her goals of revenge paying back all those who have wronged her but i looked at it as a violent action cartoon much like the later 80 s films and enjoyed it for what it was as always this film features some beautiful asian actresses and some colorful heavies meiko kaji almost always reserved quiet yet chilly staring down her enemies with violent intent is in fine form in more ways than one and reisen lee as her cross eyed repugnant adversary runs away with the picture as a perfectly realized contemptibly abusive foe worthy of psychological torment when both are in prison nami s ways of torturing her are sweet my favorite scene has nothing to do with the plot but is so wonderfully wrong features a dog discovering gondo s rotted severed arm walking through a street eventually finding a resting place to chew on it,1
77,my parents used to rent a lot of horror movies when i was a child we loved watching them even when they were bad they made for some enjoyment this was one such movie kind of hard to review as i have only seen it the one time as a child but it is not anything i want to track down again so i can do a more in depth review the story has some old horror actor legend dying i seem to remember he acted a bit like an over the top vincent price without being likable and classy he commits murders and dies but what is this is the movie over already no as some kids for some reason snag the body and are prepared for a fun night of being killed by the ham from beyond the grave i remember the murders were nothing all that special after the first couple and i remember this movie was rather disappointing seemed to have a good premise but it just failed to deliver the goods as more cool kills were needed and that super horror actor needed to add a bit to his repertoire,0
13940,i honestly have to say that a cat in the brain is one of the most fun and unintentionally hilarious films i ve ever seen this film is packed with stupid dialog ridiculous scenes and a self involving plot starring legendary horror director lucio fulci himself the threadbare story line is about an aging director fulci who is also named lucio fulci in the film who is starting to go nuts and hallucinate because of all the vicious things he s put down in film over the past many years he goes to a shrink who hypnotizes fulci and tells him that he will believe himself to be a killer but that the shrink will actually be the one doing the killing the rest of the film is made up of shots from the film that fulci is directing during all this action scenes of the shrink killing people all the while grinning like a f cking moron and some of fulci s hallucination sequences oh and a few tits thrown in for good measure as well a cat in the brain is completely over top and ridiculous in every sense the gore is classic fulci nasty and strong with some really decent scenes the chainsaw sectioning of a female corpse is pretty cool as is the chainsaw beheading of a small boy lots of stabbings gougings and other cool kill scenes make this one a pretty non stop bloodbath the ridiculous dialog lick it lick it as well as some of the insanely goofy scenes the nazi orgy the opera singing slap fest and the running down of an innocent hippy come easily to mind make this one fun as hell not nearly as dark as some of fulci s other films cat is more of a self indulgent horror comedy that if it wasn t meant to be funny is actually kind of sad i say to grab a fifth of cheap bourbon and settle in to this one i watched cat with a few friends and we laughed the entire time this is the feel good movie of the summer recommended 8 10,1
24430,and i do peter falk has created a role that will live on forever in tv land and i m grateful for that this isn t one of his finest hours though columbo goes to college and basically teaches how he solves a crime and yet there are bad guys who go ahead and think they re smarter than he is what all us fans know is that columbo needs a worthy opponent without a great enemy how can he be the hero in the wrinkled coat still it s better than no columbo and i ll wait and watch the next one as well,1
11493,my mother forced me to watch this movie with her she apparently will watch anything with a vampire counsel in it i was bored throughout at different points underworld rise of the lycans is reminiscent of spartacus battle for the planet of the apes the passion of the christ and mandingo what it reminds me most of are those italian sword and sandal pictures of the nineteen sixties not the good ones that spend an inordinate amount of time showing greek or roman despots in robes talking and plotting incessantly while you wait impatiently for the muscle man hero and his lover usually the despots daughter to do something this film was in desperate need of some color and suspense the characters were pretty two dimensional the sets looked as if they were constructed entirely of pewter i wonder how many civil war chess sets were melted down to make this movie all those wearing fishnet stockings on your arms and black lipstick feel free to click no,0
8945,forget the lousy acting that can be forgiven in this sort of film or even the terrible unnatural dialog and illogical events if my subtitles actually reflected what was said far worse is the blatant absence of a skillful or experienced director who maybe took a holiday with the editor while the film was being made watching the film it feels completely out of date even though it was only made 7 years ago a computer virus as a portal to the afterlife lol a dial up internetconnection clucky ghost images photoshopped on pictures he look over there is that is that a face zoom in on face oops sound breaks off chop next scene scenes and sequences are poorly edited and as a result don t flow at all you ll be watching a girl finding a corpse still hanging from the knot in one scene and then literally 10 seconds later seeing her again at some place apparently unaffected smiling and going about apart from the many problems i have with the movie in terms of production value it is also painfully long and repetitive and thus utterly boring i recommend shutter in stead an oriental thai horror movie done well,0
13370,not all but most of this story is buster being mistaken for dead shot dan a notorious criminal there really is no story just a series of adventures to show off buster s physical talents which are amazing and his comedic timing the 27 minute film is basically one adventure after the other mostly involving someone chasing our hero earlier it s a couple of policemen on their beats racing through the streets after keaton and later it s big joe roberts a rotund cop and father a girl buster is interested in who chases him those latter scenes were the best i thought with a lot of clever gags involving the hotel elevator where big joe and his daughter live that was keaton at his best it s just a madcap half hour that makes little sense but cares it s buster at his slapstick best or near it and so it serves its purpose to entertain us just think 85 years after this film was made there are people like me still discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics cool,1
4000,i would have given this film a one star vote had it not been for the laughs i got out of it some of the dialogs were just plain so lame that they make you laugh how could some one have actually talked like this not to mention the fact that the bodyguard majors antonio sabato jr flew a 747 like a pro and michael pare s team of whiners were able to dig a trench filled with gasoline and blow up a huge boulder in the nick of time did anyone notice the lame tribute to fantasy island with the guy saying boss the plane to michael pare just as the 747 comes in sight the only saving grace were the cute girls and even cuter female hijackers not to mention that the main hijacker deserved to die the lame death that he did for being such a joker imagine escaping from being tied up just to shot by a crossbow hello the poor pilot probably died in the plane while everyone was eating steak and having rum just for laughs they should make a sequel to show us how they all spend the night in the midst of a category 3 hurricane on neptune atoll did i hear michael pare calling it the best honeymoon resort in the pacific now that would make an interesting movie,0
18354,there was a lot about little vera that was strange to me all in all i did enjoy this movie but a lot of the way the characters behaved was not what i was used to for example the environment that vera s family lived in was very tense almost every time the family was together they were either drinking fighting or yelling and frequently it was a combination of the three after i had viewed the film i felt tense because of all the confrontation that took place during it i was however very interested in watching the story if this middle class russian family throughout the entire film we are reminded of the industrialized state of russia because of the repeated shots of a train passing by the screen it gave the viewer a sense of a mechanically lived life the characters seemed to be focused on living their lives through work and drinking after work there was not a feeling of happiness throughout the film the only time a character was not yelling was when vera first fell in love with her fianc sergei this was very short lived because the viewer later discovers after sergei locks vera s father in a bathroom and vera lets him out after which the father proceeds to stab sergei that he is abusive another time vera is told that the only reason she was born was so the family could get a larger apartment it is very interesting watching how both vera and the family were able to cope with each other s behavior the film was definitely worth watching because of its depiction of how life could be in areas of russia,1
18821,this story of a teacher who has a relationship with a student is told in a subtle manner something which sets it apart from most films with this plot mr lam jacky cheung has a relationship with choy karena lam who was also so good in koma in what at first appears to be an inexplicable situation he is married for 20 years to ching the great anita mui in her last role before she was cruelly taken from us and it appears to be a loving relationship when ching offers to care for hers and mr lam s former teacher choy and mr lam have the opportunity to be together what makes the film so good is director ann hui s pacing it takes a while to uncover the secrets of the lamsm and it all makes sense the movie is very dramatic and touching you don t feel any repulsion about the teacher student situation something that elevates this film above many with the same plot it is slow moving but stay with it also revel in ms mui s wonderful unglamorous but beautiful performance she was and is someone truly special and in this film you fall in love with her one last time it is worth the time to witness and just be there with her,1
8716,this early film from director bob clark porky s black christmas a christmas story didn t really pump my nads like i expected in fact it straight up annoyed me it s about a theater troupe who sail to a burial island consisting of dead criminals where they plan to conjure some evil forces and resurrect some corpses the leader of their group a conceited black magic enthusiast and possible homosexual attempts to summon satan s help with the re animation of an exhumed body which fails so they take the corpse to the nearby deserted caretaker s house and play with it nothing interesting happens until the last fifteen minutes or so when the undead finally spring from their graves and go after the desecrater s the make up effects are okay the gore is very minimal pg rating and the extremely irritating characters are focused on way to much which really got on my nerves i guess having group of terrible actors bickering for an hour was suppose to equal some comedic status yet i found no humor in it whatsoever the entire concept is just ridiculous how these kids are willing to dig up and monkey around with a dead body for as long as they did the characters are stereotypical and bland and the movie is just plain boring don t waste your time with it,0

12642,rita hayworth lights up the screen in this fun fancy and delightful musical starring gene kelly rita plays nightclub dancer rusty parker who has dreams to be a successful broadway star unfortunately her career is getting no where in danny mcguire s night club when one of her fellow dancers says she s going to enter a cover girl contest she decides to follow her dreams and enters she reminds the publisher of her grandma who he was deeply in love with many years ago but when she finds this success her boyfriend is not happy about it i had never seen rita before this and i am so glad i did she has such a scene presence and is a very good actress there are some good numbers in here not the best of any musical but they are melodic and good to listen to one thing i didn t like was gene kelly s character he should have supported his girlfriend but anyway that s perhaps the only criticism i have about this movie cover girl is a glorious fluffy film perfect escapism not everyone s ideal movie but a wonderful movie nonetheless due to rita hayworth s star power great movie truly impressed,1
13166,dr stephens michael harvey head of a seriously understaffed institute for the insane takes a progressive approach towards the treatment of his patients even allowing his loonies complete freedom of the building day and night he pays the price for his forward thinking however when he rather stupidly prescribes chopping wood with an axe as therapy for one of his patients and consequently gets his neck mistaken for a log serves him right for not suggesting basket weaving shortly after this tragic incident nurse charlotte beale rosie holotik arrives at the hospital to take up position as the doctor s assistant and discovers that the facility is now being run by the much sterner dr geraldine masters annabelle weenick despite being unaware of her deceased predecessor s decision to employ ms beale and not particularly eager to take on new staff dr masters agrees to let the pretty nurse begin work but following several harrowing experiences at the hospital charlotte begins to wonder whether it might have been better if she had been turned away it doesn t take a genius to figure out what is actually happening at the hospital the lunatics have taken over the asylum schtick being a premise that should be familiar to most seasoned horror fans but s f brownrigg s don t look in the basement still proves to be an entertaining piece of drive in fun thanks to its well defined collection of nutters lobotomised popsicle sucking sam bill mcghee judge oliver w cameron gene ross who continuously mumbles courtroom phrases old mrs callingham rhea macadams who recites william allingham s creepy poem the fairies and warns charlotte of impending doom cackling loon danny jessie kirby who delights in teasing the other patients harriet camilla carr who thinks her doll is a real baby army nut sergeant jaffee hugh feagin and best of all allyson king betty chandler whose rejection by a series of men has left her with a craving for love ie she tries to jump any man who goes near her this convincingly crazy set of characters plus a bit of gore and nudity reasonable direction from brownrigg who also gave us the impressive white trash horror scum of the earth and a solid turn from playboy covergirl holotik all go to turn an otherwise rather predictable low budget piece of exploitation into a very watchable psycho shocker,1
7494,nothing carson daly has ever said or done on this show has ever made me laugh or even smile a little i do not understand how this show has survived for so many years even the funny band member is just like one of those kids in high school who thinks nobody is good enough to even look at him daly and that dude are just arrogant frat boys it seems like they don t even try to be a little funny awful awful awful show it makes my soul cry i just cannot stress enough how awful this show is don t watch it but if you absolutely have to i recommend clawing your eyes out and clogging your ears with cement beforehand,0
13954,mr bean has always been my favorite no matte how many times you watch the same thing the show never gets monotonous or repetitive mr bean is one of the greatest comedians in the world who doesn t need to even speak to make people laugh his gestures his facial expressions and his face itself is so funny to watch the situations which he faces on the show is simply hilarious and the way he handles them is even greater there is simply no reason why this show shouldn t receive a 10 because it is fabulous its something that would even make the most serious or sad person in the universe laugh some of my all time favorites episodes from the show are 1 when mr bean lodges at a hotel 2 the one where he watches the scary film 3 mind the baby the diaper scene especially in fact all the episodes are so good that it is really difficult to criticize the show mr bean can go to any heights to prove that he is funny including completely stripping himself in one of the episodes the way he handled that situation was simply mind blowing 10 out of 10,1
19619,the dvd jacket in which this movie came describes it as uplifting and humorous those are not the words i would have chosen not by a long shot i would choose a word like sombre sometimes even depressing which isn t to say that it s a bad movie it s actually a pretty good movie featuring good performances from the leads with enough uncertainty throughout about what s going to happen at the end that you keep watching the uncertainty comes from the structure of the movie it seems to revolve around ellen s reminiscences of her mother s slow death from cancer as she is interviewed by the da so we know from the start that something suspicious happened at the end the questions are what and who renee zellweger was very good as ellen the somewhat resentful daughter who has to give up her life and job in new york to return home to care for her sick mother ellen evolves through the movie moreso than any other character as she learns to deal with both the strengths and weaknesses of her parents her relationship with her father william hurt is quite interesting my initial impression was that they were quite close but the warts in the relationship start to show after a while hurt was effective as the detached husband detached not in an uncaring way but in the sense of being unable to cope with what s happening to his wife and seeking escape from it in various ways finally meryl streep as the cancer stricken kate was very convincing in the role seeking to live out what remains of her life in the most fulfilling way possible then dealing with the anger she feels at her increasing debilitation in a way watching a family deal with this kind of crisis reminded me a little bit of ordinary people although this movie was far less emotionally intense so not uplifting and humorous with all due respect to whoever wrote the synopsis on the dvd jacket but very good in its own way 7 10,1
17176,the italian job requires daylight hours and no experience is required this is a great matinee and a good afternoon at the movies the plot is good but the actual playing out of the plot is very simple and requires no thought process it s car chases explosions and all for the simple purpose of defeating the bad guy played by edward norton for norton it seems he is content to portray the exact same characters as in his previous films such as the score mark wahlberg and charlize theron deserve better scripts warning if you ve seen the trailer then you have seen the movie if you re looking for entertainment at inexpensive prices then you need the italian job,1
6971,i gave this movie a chance only because it had very good reviews after seeing the trailer i thought what an unfunny movie full of clich s but i decided to give it a shot because trailers often don t portray the movie very well what a waste of time the movie is worst than the trailer and after spending 2 hours watching it i couldn t recall one single line that made me laugh the funniest parts of the movie were the csi parodies but that also is pretty pass i couldn t relate to any of the characters nor hope that they will be together because i found them utterly stupid the plot is extremely predictable and inconclusive unintelligent comedy for people who are either still in high school or feel that way mentally,0
24946,i really liked the first part of this film in africa for about an hour or so until the animal cruelty by civilized humans in scotland got to me in the second half and made me so sad i couldn t watch some of it however this was done by the filmmaker to make a point that early natural scientists ruined everything alive they didn t understand by studying it literally to death without considering the rights and comfort of the animals studied which we know now shouldn t be studied anywhere but in the natural world they inhabit and as unobtrusively as possible i do recommend this film as it was a mostly serious and honest story of tarzan and made a point of showing the gross animal cruelty that was rampant in the 19th century scientific world as well as the pure and simple beautifully primitive life tarzan lived as a young man who was found as a baby and raised by chimps after the violent death of his parents in the african jungle christopher lambert was wonderful and very soulful in his life of tarzan role as was ralph richardson in his last film role as tarzan s ultra rich nobility reeking gramps in scotland andy macdowell was pretty and pretty good as tarzan s gussied up and civilized jane in her first movie role from his charismatic work in this film and his very haunting eyes i cannot understand why lambert did not later become a big star but his really bad movie choices later may have done him in the terrific ian holm as a wounded frenchman in africa helped by tarzan and who then escorted tarzan back to his previously unknown ancestral home in scotland was great as always i am so glad tarzan got sick of and didn t stay in the animal cruel civilized world at that time and went home to africa in the end to live out his life with his gentle and loving ape relatives who raised him instead of staying in scotland and living like royalty which would have ruined him if it didn t kill him first,1
23040,i love sarah waters s fingersmith and was worried about the tv adaptation as i d been disappointed by the bbc s version of tipping the velvet which although beautiful to look at was let down by keeley hawes not being able to sing and rachael stirling not being able to act fingersmith is a very tightly plotted novel with breath taking twists and turns and i wondered if this could be done justice to in just 3 hours i needn t have worried the adaptation was excellent very little cut out and went along at a cracking pace although i did wonder whether if you hadn t read the book would you miss things it had the look and feel of a bbc classic costume drama and i kept having to remind myself that this is a contemporary book the acting was stellar sally hawkins acting her heart out as sue trinder and elaine cassidy a slow burner who by the end of the story was incandescent as maud lilley the love the passion the realisation of the acts of betrayal both would have to perform were written on their faces it was a joy to watch i hope rachael stirling was watching that s how you play a sarah waters character,1
1663,murder by numbers is one of those movies that you expect is made for tv but isn t considering the only actor of any note is bullock although michael pitt seems to be moving onto bigger and better things it isn t a great surprise that this movie quickly fades away from memory to be replaced by more important things like remembering to lock your front door when you go out or putting clothes back on when you come out of the shower bullock plays cassie mayweather a cop with personal issues don t they all together with her new partner a wet looking ben chaplin she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman nothing unusual there except that the perps are a couple of teenage students who think they ve planned and executed the perfect murder as the investigation continues a battle of wills emerges between cassie and the main suspect richie haywood ryan gosling the crippling issue here is that the two leads are hopeless bullock though she is very nice to look at is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical cop as rodney dangerfield actually he d be better chaplin for his sins is a complete non entity and i feel sorry that he has to put this film on his cv in his attempt to break into hollywood at least gosling and pitt as the conniving sneering suspects acquit themselves adequately as if dodgy leads weren t bad enough a story that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable but illogical ending shoot this film in the head before it has a chance to run murder by numbers has absolutely nothing going for it even a pointless nude scene by bullock wouldn t redeem it well just a little but still not enough to save it forgettable predictable and redundant this is one film that isn t going to move the cop genre forward as cassie probably says on her next case there s nothing to see here people move along keep moving,0
853,if i could give this movie a negative rating i would the humor is the cruelest i have ever seen in a film horrible things happen to good people and people who have already suffered horribly through no fault of their own there are 2 plots neither of which supports half of a film where is the depth others see in this movie that no good deed goes unpunished that only the heartless can succeed the film does start well and the black and white is very moody and well done the acting is very good and convincing witch makes the cruel humor even more horrifying if you think that the 3 stooges are too nice to each other if watching the beheading of a kidnap victim with a bowie knife is a real thigh slapper if you thought schindler s list was hilarious then this movie is for you,0
769,spoilers ahead this same exact plot from this movie has been done before it has been done in ferris bueller s day off marques bat man houston plays sick his gullible parents believe him his sister knows that he s faking but she still must go to school she is mad he has a party with his friends while his parents are away by the time his parents get home he is sick again and his parents never found out about the party i like immature better when they were in house party 3 and still immature,0
8082,i used to always love the bill because of its great script and characters but lately i feel as though it has turned into an emotional type of soap if you look at promotional pictures posters of the bill now you will see either two of the officers hugging kissing or something to do with friendships whereas promotional pictures of the bill a long time ago would have shown something to do with crime this proves that it has changed a lot from being an absolutely amazing police drama to an average type of television soap when i watch it i feel like i m watching a police version of coronation street or something similar i have to say i still like the bill as i m interested in police work and that type of thing but i really miss the greatness that the bill used to have i want to rate it as 2 out of ten because you have to admit it has been totally ruined by the people who took the bill over as for the script and characters they have both gone downhill most of the great characters are gone now although a few still remain i think and i m not saying that the newer characters are poor or anything because they definitely aren t its just that they lack the tough looks personalities and script lines that all of the old characters used to have because most of the new ones are at the moment involved with silly relationships and family trouble overall being one of the only police programs on television these days the bill will always be a crappily interesting thing to watch but like i say it has lost a lot of its uniqueness if thats the right spelling and would now be classed as a terrible unreal television soap recommended to watch for a good laugh over the stupidity of the police officers involved 2 10,0
12570,i gave this film my rare 10 stars when i first began watching it and realized it would not be a film with a strong plot line i almost turned it off i am very glad i didn t this is a character driven film a true story which revolves mainly around the life of rachel nanny crosby a strong beautiful inside and out black woman and how she touched the lives of so many in the community of lackawanna highly interesting not only its strong characterizations of nanny and the people who lived at her boardinghouse but also it gives us a look at what life and community were like for african americans in the 1950 s prior to integration and the good and bad sides of segregation and how it ultimately affected and changed the black community in addition to excellent performances by all members of the cast there is some fine singing and dancing from that era,1
10320,this p of s was highly recommended to me by two friends that have great similar to mine taste in films and have seen more than anyone i know i have no idea what they saw in this movie sadistic cruel and repulsive is fine in an entertaining movie but this is a windbag effort trying to pass itself off as highbrow lowbrow movie making or is it lowbrow highbrow the ancient generation gap clich no redeeming social value comes to mind bill pullman is trying maybe a little to hard and except for the kid the rest of the acting seems self conscious and kinda lame save yourself from this and watch a double feature of in cold blood and the hitcher as somebody said this would never have been made if jennifer lynch was not the overrated david lynch s daughter,0
5293,i was duped into watching this by the many friendly reviews here boy are they way off mark to give this 9 to 10 points and call it one of the best movies of the 1990ies is just unjustifiable the big problem here is lack of pace and a paper thin plot it s like slapstick on prozac everything trundles along predictably and listlessly the plot is weak to begin with two garbage men peep on their foxy neighbour witness a murder and unravel a waste disposal conspiracy and the movie never manages to go much further there are some amusing situations and decent acting but that s not anywhere near enough to save this jalopy of a movie it s simply a comedy that doesn t get its fat ass off the ground so why waste your time,0
11561,mr and mrs smith is one of the not too well known early american hitchcock s movie but if lifeboat wich unfortunately also belongs to this category is an underrated masterpiece not all the movies signed by the master of suspense in that time the early 40 s are really worth seeing and to tell the truth not discovering this film isn t really a lost mr and mrs smith is an average and conventional screwball comedy where it s rather hard to find the hitchcock s touch maybe you can catch a glimpse of his shadow wich isn t much in the cruelty that carole lombard is sometime capable of but it s well hidden in an impersonal package in a vertigo scene where two of the characters are trapped on top of a trade fair attraction and maybe in the character of the mother and that s about it even for the hitchcock fan there is little to connect with and for the screwball comedies amateur there isn t very much more none of the situation are exaggerated enough for being really funny and we re far from the masterpieces of hawks for instance and if one or two scene are quite amusing there re not even the funniest in hitchcock s filmography who created comical situations in almost all his movies even psycho could be considered full of very dark humor so there is really little to save in this movie that can without annoying anyone or maybe only both hardcore fans of hitchcock and screwball comedy who are in love with carole lombard stays one of the not too well known early american hitchcock s movie,0
13272,created by dennis spooner department s was a glossy thriller show about an offshoot of interpol based in geneva created to solve baffling mysteries the police could not handle if a plane landed at heathrow with no one aboard if a man was found wandering around london in a space suit if the passenger of a rolls royce suddenly transmogrified into a skeleton if a train pulling into a tube station turned out to contain dead commuters you called on department s to sort things out peter wyngarde played jason king a flamboyantly dressed crime novelist whose fertile imagination helped crack many of the bizarre cases king caught the public s fancy and was later awarded a spin off show he was ably assisted by american stuart sullivan joel fabiani and the delectable annabelle hurst rosemary nicols unusually for a 60 s show the department was headed by a black man sir curtis seretse dennis alaba peters if the show looked and felt a lot like the avengers it was hardly surprising it shared many of the same writers and directors the colourful titles were designed by chambers partners and are worth tuning in for alone as was the case with so many i t c series the music was composed by edwin astley his theme for department s has got to rank as one of the best television themes of all time predictably the show looks a little sexist and dated now but don t let that dissuade you from tuning in imagine a hybrid of jonathan creek and the austin powers movies and you ve got department s trivia note the episode a small war of nerves features a young sir anthony hopkins in a major role,1
16669,this film promises much but delivers little the basic problem has to do with the inclusion of charlotte gainsbourg s character in this film immigrants from sicily did not need a redheaded anglo in any way the movie may have needed her but new citizens certainly did not in my opinion the decision to include her destroys the continuity of the film this is particularly troubling since it seems to demean not only the characters in the movie but also the history of immigration itself immigrants themselves were heroic figures fully capable of getting along without having to satisfied what i believer to be a veiled image of the white man s burden i wonder if someone will make a movie of irish immigrants which will include a sicilian woman as a major character the left elbow index considers seven aspects of film acting production sets dialogue artistry film continuity plot and character development on a scale from high of 10 for excellent 5 for average and 1 for needs help both film continuity and plot rate a low of 1 the continuity as discussed above is further degraded by the surrealistic ending does not a film of such important historical significance deserve more than a conclusion which reminds one of marc chagall the plot is simple enough until it seems to become entangled with too much time in the old country too little time on the ship and too much emphasis on the ending the acting and character development is average since all the characters are fixed throughout the film and the inclusion of the anglo saxon speaking perfect english almost turns the movie into a satire where s groucho when you need him the production sets the dialogue and the artistry are very good each rating a 10 the sets in sicily on the ship and on ellis island are as good as one can find the dialogue is marvelous and the ethic singing is superb i agree with scorsese that listening to the sicilian dialect is a pleasure note that the immigrants speak of america not the united states the ideal vs the political reality the are many good artistic scenes with dreams of america gold coins raining and giant veggies among the best the average left elbow index is 5 25 raised to a 7 0 when equated with the imdb scale one other notion seems to run through ellis island experience the tribulations of pass immigrants was grueling later in 2006 one only had to pay a coyote or boat owner and sneak into the county under the darkness of night no questions asked the movie is worth seeing but it appears that what one sees is problematical,1
2193,connery climbs aboard the moore buffoon train in this stinker of a movie tossing away everything that made bond successful in the first place this movie further degrades the bond character throwing him into the category of inspector gadget get smart this ain t there is no style here only second rate actors performing on cheap sets it s a shame that connery couldn t lend an element of class here but it doesn t come across everything here reeks of mediocrity including connery s bad toupee perhaps if i was snowed in and given the choice between watching never say never again and howard the duck i would choose the former if you want the real james bond pick up any ian flemming novel,0
20215,from the opening sequence filled with black and white shots reminiscent of gordan parks photos this film draws the viewer into a feeling of artistic renaissance the backdrop of a poetry cafe aptly named the sanctuary provides just that the jazz that permeates the film and the cinematography will seduce you this story of love actually allows love to grow to evolve and ultimately mature a rarity in hollywood everyone can identify with some stage of their journey towards each other this tale of two artist that just can t quite get it together sparked a debate amongst its viewers should she have gone away should he have stopped her who knows starring larenz tate darius lovehall and nia long nina moseley with a scene stealing performance by isiah washington savon and lisa nicole carson josie nichols as the ultimate best friend this film is a romantic jewel see this one with someone you love wink,1
13465,ghillie a remake of the telugu okkadu is thankfully a clarified version of the original it packs the same punch and dharani true to his cinematic brilliance delivers it with style and panache a flagging vijay s career with the entry of the likes of surya and vikram on the fray got the much needed uplift with this movie this might well prove to be the best movie vijay has ever been on considering the choices he has been making since then the hard working actor seems to have lost his bearing what with talented new entrants being accepted both by the industry and public alike the tightly snug script which runs at a neck break speed revolves around velu a willful youngster aspiring to make a mark in the game of kabaddi a popular game among boys in india the events following the chance encounter with muthupandi his rescue of the girl in distress and how he juggles with the aspirations of his friends and his own forms the fulcrum and end of the movie vijay fits as a t into the role and essays a subdued and believable portrayal of the boy next door trisha has more than a stereotyped tamil heroine mantle to play the role is far more complex than just a girl in trouble with limited dialog s trisha exploits her occasional muted expressions and subtle vulnerability to add color to the role this is a classic case of a cover page girl coming of age to become a professional actress trisha became my personal favorite after this movie the movie ends on predictable lines although one has to credit the director for keeping the audience guessing on many things including trisha s change in decision to leave the country prakash raj deserves a word of praise for providing the perfect counter weight for vijay s role his almost indomitable stature in the role of a villain and the apparent chinks in the hero s armor form a perfect ploy for keeping the audience guessing overall this is a great movie that deserves at least a single viewing i give it a clear 8 out of 10,1
11211,the man gaston modot and the young girl lya lys go through the film consumed by passion for each other they long to be together but their moments together are constantly interrupted the film is strewn together with imagery and comes to a halt after an hour do the lovers find happiness the film starts interestingly with footage of scorpions but you soon realize that its all a pretentious piece of nonsense it s made as a silent film with occasional dialogue and it has a non stop soundtrack playing that at one point is so irritating that you will turn the sound down and want to watch it as a silent film the continuous drum rolls must have driven cinema audiences mad there are some genuinely funny moments eg when the man kicks a dog and when he knocks over a blind man unfortunately this humour is carried out in the name of art so its just pseudo nonsense the film is crap,0
18010,american movie is a wonderful documentary it follows the trials and tribulations of a very determined independent filmmaker as he struggles to finish his first film the raw footage and insightful content of this film is an excellent example of how documentaries should be produced i also feel that the film can very inspirational to those of us that want to be filmmakers ourselves,1
21586,i am not exactly how sure the accuracy is with this movie but i can tell you that i was thoroughly entertained by this movie the character of gust played perfectly by phillip seymour hoffman was one of the most unique yet entertaining characters in recent memory this movie informed yet managed to avoid preaching to the audience it made me laugh made me sad made me feel alive and glad to be spending the time to watch the movie it takes no time to understand what is going on and takes you on a roller coaster ride of genuine human emotion i thought i knew my history apparently i didn t know it at all i give this move 9 out of 10 and recommend it for all adults and young adults and the young at heart just not the young but as soon as they are allowed to see r rated movies make it a priority,1
14906,i love military comedies sgt bilko stripes in the army now major payne and down periscope is hilarious but it has a heart as well the stingray ss 161 the uss pampanito was gorgeous absolutely beautiful a piece of art come alive so it was a diesel engine sub so what i learned that the aircraft carrier uss ranger which stood in for the enterprise in star trek iv a huge ship was conventionally powered which might mean that ranger was a diesel too my favorite scene pascal jesus buckman this can s been on the stingray since korea this can expired in 1966 buckman takes finger full and tastes it what s the matter sir it still tastes like creamed corn pascal yelling except it s deviled ham buckman that would be a problem it s story perhaps a wee strained seemed plausible winslow respected dodge and seemed to care about him so he wanted to give dodge a chance he gave him a battered but still seaworthy balao class sub and assigns him the task of using the diesel sub to evade the nuclear navy and attack charlston harbor and norfolk 2 star admiral graham with his eye on his third star and a grudge against dodge assigned him the ragtag crew hoping that they would screw up so dodge would lose can tom dodge get the crew up to speed and working as a team and can he take an old out of date sub and beat the navy s best,1
17326,but it is also minnie s and pete s too yes the grumpy captain may not look like pete but it is mickey and minnie are the best characters both of them are very sweet and likable interestingly minnie is more of a lady in this than what she usually is today and mickey is less than considerate in this than he is now pete is still the same old meanie but he looks a bit different in this famous episode on board a little steamboat mickey minnie and some side characters have a great deal of fun and a great deal of annoyances even in their first appearances the three main characters are very developed i quite like this episode although overall i prefer the mickey mouse in the future i like the animation the steamboat and music theme the clever gags and of course mickey and minnie like many early cartoons this is very random walt came up with a very basic plot and just added gags to gear it along there is also a parrot side character who is very annoying and rather unnecessary these are the things i do not like about it another interesting thing about this episode that a colour version has not been made for it or if it has i ve never heard about it anyone who just enjoys mickey mouse and disney will enjoy this,1
1648,1940 s cartoon banned nowadays probably because of the black beauty gag in which daffy rides a black person as if it were a horse the whole story takes place in a bookstore where the characters of the books come to life every evening so we have among others the ugly duck daffy and the wolf of wallstreet they wind up in a chase after the wolf tricked daffy with a phony duck hence the title and chase is all there is in this little cartoon that doesn t have any real appeal nowadays only fun if you re a true fan of the looney tunes i guess 4 10,0
2786,i am easily pleased i like bad films i like films featuring attractive young women in small amounts of clothing this film gives all the above a bad name yes you know going in that what you re getting is not high art or anything like but even for the type of movie it is beach babes from beyond isn t very good some people have given it 10 i can only assume that these are people who have had the organs which enable rational thought to take place surgically removed it isn t very good it simply isn t very good 3 out of 10 solely on the grounds of a novelty value for the famous relatives and burt ward and b some of the girls are cute oh by the way did i tell you that it isn t very good,0
11476,i was told jon was for awhile on spiritual experiences i guessed the film will be interesting in fact isn t at all not so much profound for a such subject eternity never ending life experiences after death and dejavu the film is not as a comedy but isn t funny at all at least not express yet it s so naive charming film but naive film a must to avoid the middle ages sequences seems coming directly from fairy tales and it s not the matter at all eileen davidson is so charming and voight is doing his best normal is a co producer and screenwriter of this movie the film was launched straight on video so i discovered it on a video store it s a pity cause i well know voight was seriously involved with spirituality and the film isn t so much profound about it,0
3579,let me preface this by going on record i am a huge george clooney fan and i love john krasinski in the office well i was and i did this was the world s worst hang nail and it took 113 minutes to rip it off the stupefying boredom was interrupted only by my frequent efforts to read my watch and estimate when it would be over every funny scene was in the previews all three of them there was no real story no character development and the script was just plain bad i ve had a colonoscopy that was more enjoyable the title should have been superduper bad this movie is a lock for a razzie it should get a whole slough of razzies i want my money back,0
9831,take fame and you ve got served and roughly jam them together and what do you got this god awful movie custom made for dull normal adolescents the plot very closely follows you ve got served three ghetto afro teeners this time living in john water s baltimore not far from peckers home spend their time getting failing grades in high school and dancing in dilapidated 100 year old buildings with hoochy mamas to finance their expensive baggy hip hop clothing tastes they steal cars and deliver them to the local chop shop not unlike john tony manaro travolta who worked in a brooklyn paint store so he could purchase his polyester disco clothes tyler gage one of the black three musketeers gets caught trashing the local fame high school and is forced to perform janitorial duties he meets nora clark a 26 year old white high school student and discovers he s irish american much to the chagrin of his black buddies mac and skinny as in you ve got served crime doesn t pay and skinny the youngest member of the trio gets shot by a bad bad leroy brown type but that doesn t stop the music and heart stopping finale,0
12319,pilot mitch macafee jeff morrow sees a ufo while test flying a plane but nothing shows up on radar then planes and ships start disappearing and reports of a ufo increase it turns out it s a giant monster bird that is attacking and killing but what is it and why is it here this has all the right elements for a classic it has an actually pretty entertaining script i was never really bored the acting is good for a 1950s monster movie morrow doesn t overdo the macho hero act and mara corday is quite good as the requisite female love interest she s also strong and takes care of herself even though she is off getting food and coffee for everyone all during the movie the problem here is the monster dear god it s terrible it looks like a deranged turkey it has a long neck a hilariously stupid beak some teeth a few strands of hair on its head and claws and oh yes it squawks not roaring squawking the actors had no idea what it looked like it was added after production actors morrow and corday were horrified when they finally saw it in a theatre morrow said his audience burst out laughing and he left the theatre quickly before the movie ended producer sam katzman was responsible for this he wanted to save money and gave the world the stupidest monster ever and you can see the wires moving it too this gets 4 stars only because morrow and corday are so good and the script is well done it gets no stars for the pathetic monster wait till you see it attack what is obviously a toy train worth a look if you re a horror fan to see what has to be the stupidest monster ever,0
7196,honest to god the outline pretty much says it all the planet andromina not to be confused with aunt jemima is represented by a cheap l a stripclub there s no strippers so the most recent male visitors go off to recruit strippers the men get mistaken for kings or arrested for spying on women although despite the fact its a planet of women we only get two women who participate in any girl girl sex scenes and eventually as always happen in science fiction cliche movies everywhere the women become convinced that men are good for something well not the men who made this movie at any rate but boy do we get to see a lot of that something in prodigious amounts of softcore sex and nudity this one has less plot then usual for such flicks so change the channel if you don t like this kind of movie and grit your teeth if you re into this kind of thing,0
9662,we picked this up as a part of a brentwood set under the title the broken skull shot directly onto video with widely varying sound and lighting quality this movie winds up with a hyperactive quality that may inspire the viewer to feelings of nervousness confusion and irritability and not in a good evil dead kind of way without going into spoilers what appears at first to be a simple revenge ghost story becomes increasingly convoluted and bizarre while there are some interesting ideas here the overall effect is likely to leave you scratching your head and saying hunh this is a very very gory movie the gore effects range all the way from full bloody head appliances to a silly video toaster effect that has to be freeze framed to be dis believed the fangoria level of gross out effects in this film is really amazing and should likely please the gore hounds while making anyone with a weak constitution feel a bit on the queasy side the broken skull is also an extremely noisy movie it features not only ambient noises captured by mikes and not replaced in post but there is a lot of shrieking no no i mean a lot a lot a lot characters scream wail howl and yell chitter and laugh maniacally turn down the volume if you value your eardrums and your nerves but you can t fault the cast for their enthusiasm they really eat up the scenery and sometimes the effect is rather entertaining in particular the actress playing a certain vietnamese immigrant delivers all of the above with a remarkable amount of gusto in fact very few of the actors were wooden some of them may have overacted a bit oh just a wee smidgen but most of them are certainly fun to watch go off the cast is ethnically diverse and kudos to the filmmakers for that the two middle aged white women however are two of the most spiteful exasperated characters since the shopkeeper in the mst3k classic the brute man just watch them seethe at all the other characters it s fun in closing the headcrusher may not become a horror icon on a par with jason voorhees michael myers or freddy kruger or even the leprechaun but we can definitely say this this was a movie,0
18749,it seems that no matter how many films are made on the subject there is no shortage of stories that emerge from the second world war it stands to reason that a conflict on such a scale as global warfare would capture the imagination of filmmakers everywhere and provide them with ample material on which to base a story heading in a different direction than most mainstream movies about the war is dark blue world a film that does not deal with the traditional major battles of the war does not tell the story of many of its major figures and does not even focus on soldiers of any of the major allied or axis powers dark blue world instead ventures into the world of refugee soldiers fighting in exile for their occupied nations the film does a marvelous job of portraying the challenges faced by czech pilots flying under the british royal air force expressing the frustration that they felt both at the language barrier between them and the other fliers but also at being restrained from achieving vengeance against the germans until being re trained dark blue world also works quite well outside the arena of the war film as being a story about human relationships a love triangle develops between the two main characters and an english woman that complicates the teacher mentor relationship of the two exiled soldiers this relationship is extremely well acted throughout developing into almost a father and son relationship at many points the aerial combat in the film is among some of the best and is also very interesting in exploring the cultural challenges mentioned above as the men struggle to fly their machines fight the enemy and relay commands and replies in an unfamiliar language the tension and struggle of these scenes continues the tension between the men on the ground just as the tension on the ground continues that felt in the air this may not be a film for everyone the hardcore war film buff may find its exploration of relationships a bit off putting but it is on the whole an excellent film regardless of the bellicose element or not,1

5116,i can t give it less than a star i tried at this moment im not sure if im halfway through it or not but i stopped actively paying attention around the time part of it was revealed to be a dream or not or maybe it was i think viewers who posted a comment that didn t include the descriptions horrible or awful or made me want to swallow a bullet are probably being nice because it is an indie film don t listen to them listen to me there is no nudity in the movie skip it i needed ten lines to submit this warning so i will also say that the goth girl that some users have described as hot is fat she has fat elephant legs,0
11857,let s just say that it might be the worst movie i ve ever seen on the front of the box of the movie it says something about it resembling reservoir dogs i fell for it hook line and sinker this is just a warning message to anyone who might read this it s not even worth renting when you want something to laugh at,0
580,possible spoilers from dreamworks and director peter chan the love letter is a romantic comedy that takes place in a picturesque new england coastal village where single mom helen kate capshaw owns a quaint little bookstore one day at work helen happens across an anonymous letter the love letter of the title that has somehow become lodged beneath the cushions of a reading couch upon reading the amorous prose therein she believes it has been written to her purposely placed in the couch for her to find and for reasons of her own thinks she knows the identity of her secret admirer inadvertently however helen leaves the letter out where her employee janet ellen degeneres finds it believes it to be for her and of course thinks she knows who wrote it circumstances then bring it into the possession of a young man named johnny tom everett scott who thinks helen has written the letter to him and before it all gets sorted out you can only imagine the hilarious situations into which all of those involved have been cast and i do mean imagine because the way this movie plays out the audience gets little more from it than what it brings along itself there are two specific areas in which this romantic comedy fails miserably it simply isn t very romantic and it s not funny and that is a potent combination that causes this film to misfire practically from the opening credits once the setting and main character helen have been established it basically goes nowhere for the next ninety minutes or so by the time you finally find out who actually wrote the letter and to whom you could care less rounding out the cast is tom selleck blythe danner julianne nicholson gloria stuart and geraldine mcewan it s a shame to see such talent wasted on such claptrap as this and looking bad in the balance kate capshaw who usually brightens up the screen just by showing up looks tired here while selleck appears to have just come in off a three day bender that s lasted a week ellen degeneres actually comes away looking the best of the bunch it is said that the journey is often a more heady experience than the destination in the case of the love letter however it would have been best for all concerned if everybody had just stayed home in the first place i rate this one 1 10,0
9087,this movie is awful i m sorry i bought this to get star worms and actually expected this to be better after how disappointed i was in star worms oh just kidding turns out this is the worst movie i ve ever seen the acting is garbage not that there really is any and the main character is a big stupid box who gets attacked by like stuff or something i can t really tell the special effects are so bad that you can t even see the warring dinosaurs which by the way do not war but just stand and kind of move their mouths or whatever those things are the movie is a headache it s very obvious the director is trying to establish a universe hahahahahahahaha really this movie is just abominable even by troma s standards the only good thing i can say about it is that it s got a lloyd kaufman intro as he tricks us yet again into watching something that isn t fit for consumption,0
23018,i loved this movie and i watch it everyday i think that although the acting isn t all that great it s really just a bunch of guys having fun with a script i had been looking all over for this movie for almost a year and when i found it for thirty dollars i just had to get it it is now by far my favorite movie of all time it deals with relationship failure and at the same time making a joke of it i loved all the parts with don vito especially the one where valo asks him for a grape when they re sitting on the porch and he tells him to eat the one rolling down the porch it really portrays him as he really is the part in the making of really touched me when they adressed brandon novak s addiction to heroin and how much his friends and family were trying to help him a new movie that s in the making called dreamseller is in production which is about the story of novak s dreams shattered by his addiction,1
4218,what could have been a good story was destroyed by the ludicrous time travel scenario if something was altered in the past that changed evolution and humans never developed the time machine would never have been built if something from the past was brought into the present it would have no effect on the past i really wish film producers would run their ideas past an actual scientist before finishing the script even if you suspend reality and assume time travel is possible you have to stick to logic otoh ben kingsley seemed to be having a great time with his over the top performance all of the other actors seemed to be doing the best they could as well it was the writing that left them twisting in the wind back to the future handled it better,0
4658,the word boring gets thrown around way too often when referring to exactly how bad a low budget horror movie might or might not be i ve seen many a b movie many horrible terribly inept b movies some with a production value of a few hundred bucks does ineptness lousy acting worse continuity and embarrassing budgets really make a movie unwatchable some would no doubt way yes most of which are probably huge fans of the matrix well i hate big budget movies so i say no bad can sometimes be funny blood freak sometimes even mind blowing troll 2 but boring will always be unwatchable hey kinda like bloodthirsty butchers which reminds me i m writing a review for this pile of garbage uh yeah anyway this is one of late british director andy milligan s many alternatives to sleeping pills this one is based on sweeney todd great milligan takes a boring story and still manages to butcher it hey that s pretty funny i said bu sorry i keep getting distracted this isn t exactly easy on second thought i ll make it easy no gore no scares no entertainment just unlikeable annoying people having incoherent conversations that s bloodthirsty butchers oh yeah and something about a barber killing people and something or other about meat pies i don t know it s not important for something a little more rewarding from andy milligan there s always the only other one i ve seen the rats are coming the werewolves are here yeah you heard me but hows about we forget about this milligan guy all together and pick up something sweet like sick girl or teenape goes to camp whatever you decide just know bloodthirsty butchers sucks possibly even more than any other version of this already lackluster tale and that b movie fans is really saying something 2 10,0
3797,full disclosure i was born in 1967 at first the premise tickled me after all if you were a teenager growing up in the age of reagan a trip down memory lane was worth a laugh or three pop rocks atari and rock em sock em robots loved em not despite the fact they were goofy but because they were goofy and silly and fun but when vh1 decided to make the series i love last tuesday i knew enough was enough goes hal sparks have nothing better to do than read from a teleprompter how idiotic slinkys are wait let me check hmmm no no it appears he doesn t snarky snotty uber hip posturing has its place but enough already,0
16902,i think the title of the movie describes it well if you are looking for a documentary on louis kahn and his work you ll have to look somewhere else although some of that is covered in this film of course i eat up pretty much anything i m fed and i don t know much of the family history revolving around this case so i believed what i was told about nathaniel and his father etc for what this movie was i thought it was pretty good a little slow and grabbing for attention at time i wish that nathaniel would have focused a little more on his father s work than his family drama although much of the history was interesting louis was a bit of a player this really is a journey through someone s life and i was happy to tag along for the experience a learning experience for me and so it seems for the filmmaker as well oh and the footage of some of kahn s work is stunning,1
19581,i was laughing so hard most of the time i had people glaring at me because they couldn t hear over my laughter i literally fell out of my seat at a specific point i m a bartender and bouncer for a living in the real world note my use of the term real world sadly it always has to come first and whenever i tell someone i play rpg s it s usually followed by one of two questions 1 what like d d i played that back in junior high 2 really i ve been looking or a group forever have room for another very rarely do people not know what d d and gaming are that having been said almost every person who watches this movie can get something out of it even if you aren t a gamer chances are there is something in your life you geek out about that can be made fun of in a light hearted way and that alone means you can relate to the hijinx in this flick it s just light hearted happiness in an hour and a half,1
5539,sure this flick set in eastern europe is filled with sexy but it absolutely has nothing to do with the nicholas cage flick 8mm an ambassador s daughter and her fianc e mix it up with a local woman in a threesome that ends up being taped the tape is used for blackmail and the stakes get higher and higher as the couple try to work it out themselves instead of going to authorities the sex comes and goes and would be the only reason for renting it i suppose if you like this sorta thing and is quite gratuitous towards the middle when we cruise along the porn scene looking for the other woman i definitely question how it got into blockbuster even with a youth restricted sticker considering how just a hint over the edge of soft core it is oh that s right it s the double standard actual art house flicks like the dreamers and y tu mama tambien get castrated r versions but straight to dvd crap like this get the unrated banner proudly attached whatever the acting is horrible the plot is mind numbingly unoriginal but really the worst offense is the idea that this is a sequel to 8mm i d give the flick a d for a grade and be nice but considering they tried to trick me it gets the f it frankly deserves,0
19541,this was a wonderful little film that truly was creative and fun something you see all too seldom in movies the film begins in russia just after the fall of the communist government as a result society seems to be in chaos and life has yet to improve now that the old regime is gone dirty cities crime and lack of housing still plague the poor residents of st petersburg into this scene of bleakness and uncertainty comes an idealistic music teacher he is among those without a home and he finally gets a letter from the government that tells him he has a tiny room in a nearby flat when he arrives the place is a mess but the people seem friendly enough so they all have a lovely party in the middle of the night they are awakened by an old lady walking out of the giant wardrobe in the room i was half expecting lucy and the other kids from the lion the witch and the wardrobe to come out but they didn t they are too shocked to do anything at first but decide soon to investigate instead of just being a clothes closet the wardrobe opens into paris how the residents of the flat respond to this magical gateway is really intriguing some like the music teacher are thrilled and in awe most of the others are more pragmatic and are mostly concerned with looting everything from paris before the gateway closes once and for all these russian thieves are awful people greedy coarse and crude but down deep very deep are hearts of gold i like how this is a metaphor for the nation now on the brink of capitalism at first they run amok grabbing everything they can and only later do they reveal some depth but mostly they act much like guests on the jerry springer show the film has many twists and turns and is both funny and mesmerizing about the only negative is that due to some harsh language and a nude scene albeit a very funny one this is not a film for kids this is a real shame as with some very minor editing this could have been a great family film,1
21335,i first watched this movie in istanbul film festival back in 1994 it was so good i took couple of friends with me and went to see it again the same week the characters are very well played and the humor here and there is amazing it sure is a very powerful gay movie some scenes make you feel you re watching an episode of friends with much more sophisticated lines i guess i ll put it in my vcr and watch it again tonight,1
23718,on account of my unfortunately not being able to find them anywhere i have not gotten to try any of the other entries in the series although i certainly would not mind and trust me i have looked for anyone who does not know this is a point and click adventure title that means that the mouse is what you use to interface with everything that you can do so with in this though there is one particular case in this where that is inaccurate i won t spoil it here for anyone who haven t yet tried it nevertheless regardless of how little experience you have with computers you can sit right down and try this there isn t even terribly many bits of this where you need to be fast or have swift reflexes heck you can adjust the speed of the text if you have it have subtitles on and thus of the talking in it and it s not enormously awkward or forced when slow accessing your inventory is easy as well as combining or using items clicking and holding down the button at anything you can affect gives three options for what to use with it be it a person a specific part of the surroundings or an object hand push pick up open etc eyes examine look through etc and mouth eat converse etc this all adds up to a welcoming friendly environment where you can approach the plentiful puzzles the amount of them is varied based on which of the two difficulty settings you try this on at your own pace and explore and take in the dozens of individual creatively done characters and areas in this to your heart s content the length of this will be determined by how much time you take to do such you ll hear no blame from me they re worth it and your skill at figuring out the solutions there are a few points in this where you get to decide if you want the harder way of completing that or not this can be enjoyed by anyone from any age there s no material that isn t acceptable for children this is one of the products that help prove that that very fact does not have to mean that it is intolerable for older audiences the animation is quality work smooth everything moves as it should and the 3rd dimension honestly isn t that sorely missed when trying this the story telling is well done and you re never unclear as to what is going on there are numerous well directed cut scenes kept in the same colorful mostly bright 2d world as the rest with well done camera motion cartoony is an appropriate word to describe this and not only the visual style it can be applied to all of this the entire world of this is very similar to but not quite the same as ours with a mix of past and present inhabited by people and filled with things that we can sort of recognize or understand at least portions of but the absurdity makes them funny that would have to be one of the greatest strengths of this right there it s hilarious a lot of that comes from the lines spoken what is said as well as how it is and those who dig british efforts with focus on verbal the likes of allo allo or the blackadder franchise will want to check this sucker out however there are several different types of jokes including but not limited to the following satire cleverness dark spoofs irony gross out comedy not exactly my favorite aspect of this and more there s self awareness with the lead addressing you personally and for example explaining why he isn t going to do what you just asked him to there are references to pop culture through a couple of decades almost all of it works hardly any gags fall flat and if you aren t in stitches during this my best guess as to the reason would be that it s simply not compatible with your sense of humor a situation that warrants no judgment and if one suspects that could be the case and wishes to find out i suggest the demo version where you for free can see if you care for the brand of play and or laughter the plot is well written nearly all of this is really develops nicely throughout and keeps your interest well the audio is all excellent crisp and well done the sound effects are spot on the music is well composed with no exceptions the voice acting is impeccable with a celebrity or two armato is fantastic as guybrush threepwood gotta love that name whom you control boen is incredible as lechuck the deceased and still threatening zombie villain the designs are immensely well done highly imaginative and all fit in spite of the relatively limited disposition of our hero when it comes to pirate deeds you do get to engage in some steer a ship board that of others and match blades in a rather unique and marvelously thought up way the re playability lies mainly in the choices during dialog etc this is linear with a tad freedom as far as the order goes so the buccaneer sitting down with this for at least the second time has not got that large an amount of possibilities as far as being challenged by this goes unless he or she has forgotten what to do in the meantime ah nothing is perfect anyone who would care to delve into a thoroughly well crafted and fascinating fictional universe and crack up countless times should get a real kick out of this the good kind not the ones that hurt and potentially leave bruises don t forget kids do not eat books that is just begging for a paper cut i would wager a guess that those who like the others would appreciate this one too and they re not the only ones who may get into this i recommend this to apart from members of aforementioned group any fan of this genre of vgs as well as anyone to whom this review appeals 8 10,1
12054,boring as hell and kind of a chick flick it s the story of a neurotic woman who struggles with the concept of marriage as a business arrangement the romantic nature of a one night stand and the uncertainty and pitfalls of true love many of the story s motifs are reminiscent of other recent kst movies e g the english patient but have far less appeal after the first half hour i started checking my watch wondering if i d make it home in time to catch leno on tv i passed up gladiator to see this,0
20101,prepare to meet your messiah they call him masten thrust male role models have become increasingly difficult to find in today s overexposed society every other day an apparent role model is forced to tearfully apologize for a youthful indiscretion or he innocently gets a few youngsters drunk on his ranch the last dinosaur is the story of the last great hunt of masten thrust an old grizzled big game hunter who serves as role model supreme despite his haggard features and bulbous nose the females including joan van ark are attracted to him like meatloaf is to cheesy lyrics thrust is openly sexist and makes no apologies for his elaborate lifestyle which includes a red kerchief and a private jet with a working fireplace thrust embarks on a mission to find and hunt the last dinosaur on earth when ironically after a rich full life he is truly the last dinosaur despite his propensity for yelling at everyone in his presence his employees and lady friends are unwaveringly loyal to him he may act as though he s perpetually drunk but make no mistake if he calls you a ding dong you are a ding dong not to be denied his own ballad thrust s song shamelessly praises him and his manliness a sampling of lyrics includes few men have ever done what he has done or even dreamed what he has dreamed few men have even tried what he has tried most men have failed where he s prevailed the world holds nothing new in store for him and things that startle you and me are just a bore to him few men have ever lived as he has lived or even walked where he has walked even bmtg banned artist clay aiken could belt out those lyrics and become an rump kicking machine thrust and his crew of scientists strap themselves into the polar borer wearing mini bike helmets though thrust affords himself the luxury of the red kerchief around his neck the giant human filled drill bit digs through the earth and ice to come popping out into a lagoon dinosaurs from the air and land soon descend upon the scientists forcing thrust and crew to run for their lives after narrowly escaping a charging dino masten lays back and blasts out a hearty laugh not so much to celebrate life but to acknowledge the game is afoot soon after it is little surprise that we see a few slightly hunched over cavemen sneaking peeks at their visitors thrust not content with simply killing a dinosaur decides then to make it his mission to bag a cave broad throughout the movie the lone t rex contradicts the belief that dinosaurs have a brain the size of a peanut despite its enormous size the local t rex is able to sidle up next to its victims virtually unnoticed with the element of surprise t rex simply crushes a scientist or two and loots the campsite every so often the bloated and cagily faced thrust is seen yelling at someone shooting at something or flirting with a primitive j lo in manly fashion thrust is like james tiberius kirk not only in his addiction to love but also when is comes to making complicated weapons using limited natural resources in a short period of time thrust and the remaining crew members construct a highly accurate catapult that flings a large boulder into the skull of the cunning t rex upon realizing that even he masten thrust cannot top this addition to his trophy case thrust decides to stay in his prehistoric surroundings the ever dwindling crew then leaves thrust to live out his days with his lovely although a bit gamely cavewoman and introduce her to his personal collection of stds this is only a brief synopsis of a movie so complicated and rich in bmtg tradition that it takes several viewings to absorb its message and realize that masten thrust is the answer the press conference complete with a yelling thrust mumbling reporters and the introduction of the great bunta is a classic moment also look for a body resembling a dead ricky schroeder lying on some logs and the most powerful use of someone being called a ding dong in cinematic history,1
10971,1983 was a bumper year for stephen king books making it to the big screen christine the dead zone and cujo were all released within a few months of each other while the dead zone was easily the pick of the bunch christine and cujo were both pretty bad and it s a close run thing as to which is the lesser of the two if pushed for an answer i d say cujo marginally is the weakest donna trenton dee wallace fresh from success as elliot s mom in e t the extra terrestrial is a mother whose marriage to husband vic daniel hugh kelly is hanging by a thread she s been having an affair with a local worker and is now dwelling on whether or not to leave her husband dragged into the marital heartache is young tad trenton danny pintauro son of donna and vic and a pretty messed up kid with a chronic phobia of the dark which often leads to severe panic attacks donna and tad take the family car to a nearby mechanics yard for repairs but as they arrive their car splutters to a halt things get a heck of a lot worse when they discover that the mechanic joe camber ed lauter isn t there he has been savagely killed by his pet dog cujo a gigantic st bernard which was recently bitten and infected by a rabid bat soon the dog has them trapped in their car and is trying everything to get inside the vehicle to tear apart these two hapless victims the weather is swelteringly hot not a living soul knows they re there the car won t start and the dog seriously wants their blood cujo has potential to be a genuinely taut siege thriller but it never really clicks into gear i ve read the book and it is quite disappointing certainly for king so it s hardly surprising that the film version amounts to so little on the printed page king was at least able to generate a degree of tension but the film is critically hampered by the fact that a st bernard simply isn t very scary the visualness of the film medium serves as a constant reminder that cujo is a st bernard in the book it was possible to forget this in the book cujo sometimes almost seemed to assume the guise of a monster even with the relatively short running time of an hour and a half cujo becomes a tedious and patience straining experience occasionally unintentionally funny and certainly never as suspenseful as it would like to be they ve even omitted the book s cruelly downbeat ending and replaced it with an all s well that ends well conclusion so that audiences can go home in a cheerful mood chalk this one down as yet another inferior king adaptation,0
15530,i m certain that people from usa don t know anything about the rest of the world but i think they mustn t talk about what they don t know and they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocrite as the usa the only places where consented sex between teenagers are illegal are the usa and islamic nations in france for instance the age of consent is 15 in brazil it s 14 in spain it s 12 so the teenagers actors 16 and 17 years old by the time of production aren t doing anything illegal nudity isn t considered big deal in almost all civilized countries and only a freak could consider a teenagers love as child molestation,1
4735,i would have given this movie a 1 but i laughed so hard so many times that i had to give it a little credit in the off off off off chance the film was supposed to be funny a movie so bad you ll think chimps wrote it you ll wish chimps had written it dialogue so canned that only it and the cockroaches will survive the coming nuclear holocaust the movie exaggerates its awfulness by intersplicing scenes from the original carrie a really good film into scenes from this one like intersplicing scenes from taxi driver into baby geniuses do not rent it alone as you will not enjoy the experience you will need someone next to you to confirm the badness of what you are viewing worst actress of the millenium goes to poor poor amy irving as the stone faced monotone disastrously wooden school counselor worst movie of the year so far see also arlington road frink 3,0
24129,i ve never really been sure whether i liked this documentary or not it was shown on channel 4 before a cut down version of revelations and is on the revelations video tape before the uncut show the documentary is basically friends of bill saying how great he was for an hour with video clips of the show mixed in a bit like a trailer for the film you re about to watch it also features david letterman grovelling like a worm for dumping bill off the his show before he died the reason bill made a joke about how pro life people should picket funerals and letterman had pro life advertising anyway look out for the video as revelations is bill at his ranting best,1
23152,life was going great for new york city advertising artist ted kramer he had a great job and a loving wife no actually his wife wasn t so loving for when ted returned home late from work that night his wife joanna had a suit case packed and was heading out the door he tried to stop her but she just got into the elevator and out of ted s life well now in addition to his job he s now got to mind the house as well as their 6 year old son billy ted assured his boss that his wife s leaving would not affect his job performance in any way it did however affect his performance as a father he blew up when billy spilled punch on his client artwork well some time later ted and billy receive a letter from joanna and it was obvious from her letter that she wasn t coming back ted was distraught well he was late coming home from work on billy s birthday which made billy sore at him ted was late to work one day and his boss yelled at him because he had missed a very important client meeting when he got home he yelled at billy for sneaking ice cream during dinner then later he truthfully told billy that the break up between he and joanna may have been his fault not billy s ted invited a good friend phyllis bernard over that night and well billy got his first look at a naked woman when ted took billy to the park the following day he fell off the jungle gym and landed face first onto his toy plane ted literally ran him to the hospital where they had to administer stitches after that life began taking a downward spiral for ted then one day out of the blue he received a phone call from none other than joanna they met in a corner caf at first they have a pleasant conversation but then joanna informs him that she has returned to collect her son and take him with her ted would have none of it and stormed out well life got even worse for ted when his boss jim o connor took him out to lunch and abruptly fired him not only that but joanna was choosing to sue for custody of billy and without a job ted didn t stand a chance in hell for winning he hired himself a lawyer john shaunessy who charged a pretty penny 15 000 exact change and that s if they win ted was also able to find a new job it was actually a step down from what he used to do with a considerable cut in salary but he accepted with great determination finally the court date january 9 1980 arrived judge atkins presiding joanna took the stand and shaunessy proceeded to question her about why she left ted and about her other relationships and how they were failures the next day ted took the stand and joanna s lawyer really grilled him like a cheeseburger ted s good friend margaret took the stand as well and she really didn t help matters well the judge took some time to think it over and sure enough one day shaunessy informs ted that he lost joanna got sole custody of billy how typical always ruling in favor of the mother well ted and billy were just devastated about parting ways they had a tearful goodbye when suddenly joanna stopped by she and ted have a little talk and well rather than just give away the ending let me assure everybody that everything turns out alright for everybody this was a very good movie dustin hoffman was very good he earned that academy award i ve also seen him in hook meet the fockers and rain man which he also won an oscar for meryl streep was good she also got an oscar justin henry was good too so where was his nomination i guess the academy had a rule against giving oscars to children but the rule was lifted when haley joel osment came along this movie has great drama light comedy and is very subtle it does a good job of holding your attention i was watching rain man on tcm the other night then this came on after and i just couldn t help but watch and that s what you should do if you like dustin hoffman or meryl streep or movies of this genre then i recommend kramer vs kramer a gripping film about the pangs of two divorced parents fighting over their child i liked ted s little speech about ruling in favor of mothers all the time what was it about sex that makes a good parents actually that s how they have the child but seriously he s right why always rule in favor of the mother because she s a woman also in the cast george coe howard duff who passed away in 1990 and howland chamberlain who passed away in 1984 watch for an up and coming jobeth williams in the nudity in the hallway scene anyway see kramer vs kramer today good movie,1
13006,one would have expected hitchcock s return to major studio filmmaking to err on the side of chastened caution surely few expected his most riotous unrestrained film a gleeful melange of vicious black comedy exciting suspense mocking manipulation and astonishing flights of fancy but that is precisely what they got strangers on a train what is remarkable is how much bruno s transgression disrupts the world of the film much has been made of the masterly crosscutting motif but its immediate effect is to completely obstruct the straight line of progress guy is making of his life and hence the society he represents or is eager to join guy is the archetypal american the working class boy made good moving in influential circles athletic successful handsome bruno is his destructive opposite gay decadent european he lives off his father in a big house and just lounges about dreaming of murder bruno s life is one of repetition circularity whereas guy moves straight ahead it is bruno s achievement to move guy into his realm represented by the merry go round and force him to transgress break the law hope for murder bruno s bruno is quite literally fighting patriarchy all the authority figures in the film are criticised bruno s father a man whose brutality we get a glimpse of but the true horror of which is constantly alluded to in the film especially in aunt clara s paintings that incredibly intense negative energy must come from somewhere anna s incredibly machiavellian self serving father the insensitive judge who thinks nothing of lunching after an execution the tennis commentator whose smugly authorative comments are always mistaken far from being the mother hater of legend hitch as robin wood perceived is deeply hostile to fathers and patriarchy bruno s transgression turns the world topsy turvy this is hitch s most surreal film whenever guy is in his plot he is filmed straight with conventionally romantic music but whenever bruno intrudes the atmosphere becomes carnivalesque bizarre much more fun this is hitch s first truly american film revelling in the primitive detritus of americana grown men puncture little boys balloons or try to throw them off merry go rounds distinguished professors of mathematics sing about goats on trains elderly society matrons are strangled at elegant soirees washington is filmed like a series of spare lines in a vast desert under a huge sky like a haunting dali painting there is one of the greatest and funniest scenes in all cinema when we see a motionless smiling bruno in a sea of turning heads at a tennis match an image worthy of magritte just look at any scene with bruno in it and watch it derail into the bizarre phalluses abound in the most ridiculous permutations check all those balloons hitch had obviously just seen the third man as well as in more staid environs washington will never look the same again strangers is also vertigo notwithstanding hitch s most overtly sexual film as well as the phalluses there is the sustained homoeroticism the remarkable play with riding horses the gobsmacking fellatio joke when hitch s daughter spills powder over the policeman and yet hitch doesn t stint on good old suspense in the very proper endeavour to show what a great artist he was critics tend to overlook what made him famous in the first place much has been made of bruno as a prototype of norman bates and hitch plays merry havoc on audience identification willing bruno into murder there is a hilariously painful sequence where bruno loses the lighter with which he intends to frame guy down a drain the gasps of tension and sighs of relief on the part of the audience i was a part of in support of an insane murderer is inherently funny slightly disturbing and highly revealing about our true reactions to conformity and success and hitch milks it with callous glee listen to the mocking music and exagerrated compositions and kick yourself for taking it all so seriously strangers is one of hitch s five best films and therefore one of the greatest things in cinema the dialogue is so strange and brilliant i can t believe it wasn t written by chandler patricia hitchcock is a wonderful imp standing in for her cheeky father as she taunts guy the fairground finale is a remarkable dizzying fusion of exciting tense set piece black comedy and symbolic site if bruno s final words condemn him to hell according to the catholic precepts hitch is supposed to embody compare with a similar ending in the killers we applaud his integrity infinitely preferable to guy s debased serving of self,1
6882,after reading the reviews i decided to rent the dvd version i like classical music and wanted to learn more about bach i was disappointed i guess i do not know enough about bach music and the the comments were not enough for me to understand the importance or what music was being played maybe it would be appropriate with the guidance of an expert in bach s music that can explain the film i really tried and saw the whole film hopping that i would be able to enjoy at least some of it but i did not see it at your own risk,0
6619,no one expects the star trek movies to be high art but the fans do expect a movie that is as good as some of the best episodes unfortunately this movie had a muddled implausible plot that just left me cringing this is by far the worst of the nine so far movies even the chance to watch the well known characters interact in another movie can t save this movie including the goofy scenes with kirk spock and mccoy at yosemite i would say this movie is not worth a rental and hardly worth watching however for the true fan who needs to see all the movies renting this movie is about the only way you ll see it even the cable channels avoid this movie,0
2504,purported documentary that tries to examine sci fi films of the 1950s and how they affected and reflected america steven spielberg george lucas ridley scott and james cameron are interviewed and mark hamill narrates pretty terrible the insights that are given are nothing new for instance the cold war and the threat of nuclear war affected a whole generation of children well duh they try to cover all of the different sub genres of sci fi films of the 1950s the big bug movies invaders from space movies etc etc that s good but they choose the most obvious films and they ve been over analyzed to death already it was cool seeing clips from rocketship x m destination moon forbidden planet the thing and the day the earth stood still but everything the directors said was so incredibly obvious to any viewer that it s insulting even though it s under an hour i was thoroughly bored 30 minutes in this gets a 2 for some of the clips but nothing else,0
23515,in new york a group of freshmen join the high school for the performing arts after being well succeeded in their audition for four years their dreams deceptions success love and personal dramas are disclosed though the insecure doris finsecker maureen teefy the homosexual montgomery payl mccrane the aggressive leroy gene anthony ray the hopeful coco irene cara the ambitious ralph garci barry miller and their friends until their graduation day twenty eight years ago fame was a great success with the story of teenagers seeking a spot in the show business and i loved this movie and the soundtrack on cd i have just watched fame on dvd and presently i would say that it is a good movie with a great potential only but with too many flawed subplots the story follows too many characters and leaves many situations without answer i do not know whether alan parker had edition problems to reduce the running time of this movie but what happened for example with the ballerina that goes to a clinic for abortion what happened with leroy and his teacher did he fail due to his grammar problem what happened with coco after undressing her blouse in the apartment of that crook the musician that plays synthesizer and his proud father are left behind in the subplot anyway fame is still a delightful entertainment and a cult movie for me my vote is seven title brazil fama fame,1
24606,i saw this movie so long ago but it remains in my memory as the saddest movie ever i cried non stop my mother will not ever watch this movie again because its almost painful to watch anyway apart from that the story isn t exactly complex ann margaret is dying and has to give away her 10 children as if that isn t bad enough it is during the depression and she has to break up the close siblings one by one i guess this was very sad to me because i too am from a very large close knit family and could identify with each child s pain of leaving their mother and siblings maybe i am a masochist but i would like to see this movie again because it was well done and the end surprisingly is slightly happy so at least we could smile and sob simultaneously it should come on tv sometime so i can see it again,1
4432,national lampoon s dorm daze is easily the worst movie i have ever seen and i ve seen the movie kazaam anyone reading this who thinks this movie was good in any way shape or form has no idea what a good movie is and should never watch another movie again because they are indeed so stupid its hard to name everything wrong with this movie first off the plot is all over the place and can t follow all the multiple misunderstandings very well at all the acting is awful to say the least and the whole thing was poorly made any and all who worked on this movie should not be in another movie of any kid ever again it is too hard to sum up this movie in just a paragraph or two because it is so bad but for anyone out there reading this please do not watch this movie if you want a good movie to watch go turn on anything else on television even u s a has better movies than this friend,0
5801,only saw this movie late last night i remember the hype of it s release and to be honest had i viewed it back then i maybe wouldn t have been so generous i hate hype it can ruin a movie i think the movie glossed over the characters and put too much emphasis on woody he was good too although kept wondering if he was stoned the whole time it never went too deep redford was dark but not too dark and his character let me down in the end to me he should have been more confrontational with demi throwing her out perhaps or telling her that she was paid for after all he would have investigated them before he made the proposal that s not shown in the movie but no one in his perceived position would have made an offer to just anyone he was cruel to the point of breaking them up and the last straw was the house and yet demi fell for him the passages giving an insight to demi and woody s relationship were the best part of the movie there was a keen deepness that outshone the shallowness of john gages character he really could have been a lot stronger and as other people have alluded i think the movies draw card was redford and they didn t want tarnish his image i say what the hell robert was old in this movie woody and demi s characters were naive in a sense but i think that was very intentional to draw you to their plight and champion their decision but the reality is they were losing their dream home and where did they go las vegas to gamble what little they had left and then accept a proposal from an insanely rich billionaire i found their naivety when redford was seducing them a little too unrealistic the movie could have been so much more and other actors would have made a difference but having said that on late night tv it was enjoyable and i if you don t think too much also palatable,0
7730,from what i understand mr bava abandoned this project before completion and rightfully so if i were him i definitely would have made sure that every copy was burned and if anybody in the future ever asked me about this film it never happened it never existed end of story despite some great sets and good photography this is one horrible film is it supposed to be scary not in the least is it supposed to be funny puh leese a total waste of time and i really don t like to have to say that,0
4234,this is a pale imitation of the die hard franchise that just sucks the low ambitions of the movie are clearly on display when the terrorists hold the vice president hostage and he has to call the white house to beg them to transfer some money in most movies of this genre the president is kidnapped or held hostage because after all he or she is the most powerful person in the country with finger on the nuclear button etc etc would most americans have really been worried if dick cheney had been kidnapped the honest answer is probably not why the terrorists would choose a stanley cup final to carry out their operation and why despite many explosions around them the audience inside the hockey stadium is oblivious to the situation are unanswerable questions let s just say this film is really hokey not hockey those who liked the film and found it to be exciting should get a life,0
17675,i found the movie very real just as much as saving private ryan and gave an upfront account from the german perspective the graphic action and individual characters gave this movie much to keep me interested through the whole movie stalingrad was very brutal battle and the scenes gave this movie that stark reality of this battle i recommend this for anyone who is interested in military history this was my second viewing of this movie in a few years and was captivated by it s realism again the weapons uniforms and hearing it german while reading the subtitles gave it much credit for a good military movie in fact this being a german perspective of the battle i was rooting for the germans even though they were the agressor and ultimate loser of the war,1
21618,last evening i had the remarkable pleasure of seeing the movie hitch i was stunned and amazed will smith did a phenomenal job in a role that he isn t always associated with he proved once and for all that he does not need to be holding a gun to be a great actor in a movie kevin james was also very impressive i admit that i ve always like him on the king of queens but this role really brought him into the light more and i hope to see him on the big screen a lot more in the near future the movie was funny and adorable and i recommend it to any guy as the best date movie you could ever imagine the mix of comedy romance and drama left me feeling complete it s nothing like most chick flicks in the sense of tears and sadness but holds its own and i think can be equally enjoyed by males as well as females i encourage all couples especially to see this movie but even if you aren t involved with someone you may pick up some great ideas from hitch two way big thumbs up,1
12199,this is the worst hindi film i have ever seen it conforms to all the stereotypes of bad hindi films the plot is ridiculous the acting over the top and shah rukh manages to fit in a couple of song sequences even though he is playing the character of a dumb man,0
5315,if pulp fiction and get shorty didn t exist this might be an ok film when i say this i mean that nothing from this film is it s own unless it s another bit of terrible dialogue or a clich full scene all the lines like i won t say more than i have to if that from get shorty seem to appear in this rubbish sequel all the cameos like steven tyler s are acted terribly and are not needed and as for christina milian man don t get me started sadly some of the coolest actors and actresses like john travolta and uma thurman seem like they are trying to be down with the kids and hip and have nearly ruined there reputation because of this film and frankly i think the best acting is from the rock who plays alongside one of my least favourite actors vince vaughn the man tries to be funny throughout with him taking the mickey of how apparently rappers talk cedric the entertainer and andre 3000 play another terrible double act i personally think the background actors were better than cedric and andre and the only funny part of the acting of cedric andre and the rest of there gang do is the way there trousers are down to there knees so you can clearly see there boxers and the only reason i find this funny is because lots of people actually do that so in conclusion this film tries to be funny and fails miserably it doesn t have any new material comedy or coolness throughout as it copies every other film and finally the only reason you should see it is if you want to compare how bad it is to it s brilliant predecessor get shorty oh yes i forgot to mention there is a big clich at the end,0
6374,basically a road movie the gay transsexual and other gender bender themes are rather disturbing particularly when the child is involved you do have to hand it to the costume designers as for the actors the only one i was familiar with was terence stamp i suppose it was a very good performance out of his or anyone s normal range the movie as a whole was shallow just a vehicle for the clever bitchy banter all in all i don recommend this one,0

24088,a friend of mine asked doesn t one have to be pro euthanasia in order to like this movie is it a mistake of the movie to infer most quadriplegics want to end their lives interesting questions as far as i can see correct me if i m wrong there is only one quadriplegic who wanted to end his life in the sea inside think ram n sampedro addressed this in the movie as well it is he who wants to die it is he who is fighting for his right to decide his death he is speaking for himself and not other quadriplegics though his pioneering work depending on one s perspective may prove beneficial or damaging to quadriplegics down the road his primary objective is a personal one but one thing this movie does my opinion anyway is that it forces us the viewers to ask ourselves the inferring questions my friend so succinctly put forth after my first viewing of the sea inside i walked home in a conflicted blur i struggled to reconcile with this exasperating notion why would ram n want to die given the love care and sacrifices so unconditionally showered on ram n by the people surrounding him why would he doggedly cling on to his hurtful decision then on my second viewing a shared thought between ram n and the lawyer lady entered my consciousness it threw up a telling observation total dependency comes at the expense of intimacy most human beings crave for such an intimacy of course how much we value such needs depends largely on the individual as a person with a familial biased sensibility i empathised strongly with the caregivers in this movie why can t javier consider the sacrifice and the love from his family and friends is he blind to it all i would think not the miracle of the sea inside therefore is its insightful depiction of a very humanistic tug of war when we are faced with the guardianship of a sane but incapacitated loved one whom has expressed a calm conscious and rational intent to die what then is the right thing to do is caring for and keeping this loved one alive against his or her will a pious gesture does it show up the worth of our love or does it merely soothe our selfish fears of irreplaceable loss with so much understanding accorded to caregivers wouldn t their invalid charges by submitting themselves to the total dependency of others for survival also be an overlooked act of sacrifice rhetorical or not how much is dignity worth to an individual is living or dying with dignity a privilege or a right if we really care and love a person should we also respect their eventual decisions in life as in death a torrent of questions the movie might have asked answers to which i m in no position to provide in our eagerness to intellectually demarcate the merits of pro life or pro choice we run the risk of ignoring a sea of grey that s engulfing the people most intimately affected the caregivers and the ones they care for the sea inside hence attempted to present the delicate yet complex relationship dynamics between them intuitively this film understands one thing that the nature of sacrifice is never one sided in this tug of war we should endeavour not to win arguments but to intently observe and hopefully determine who is the stronger party to make that sacrifice the sea inside is a sobering film it opened my eyes to things i don t wanna see and for that i am grateful,1
8017,depressing black black comedy about a woman mia farrow who flees her house on christmas eve when she discovers her husband tony goldwyn has hired a hit man to kill her she ends up with a husband and wife scott glenn and mary louise parker and then things go wrong basically farrow keeps running and is continuously meeting very strange people and getting into morbidly unfunny situations this was advertised as a feel good movie when i saw it around christmas time at its very short run in an art cinema i found it sick unfunny and just depressing i like black humor but this was way too dark for me what happens to parker s character especially was horrifying to make matters worse eileen brennan is thrown in as a nun later on and proceeds to chew the scenery with gusto the only saving grace was farrow s acting it s much better than this picture deserves also it was a relief to see the very talented stephen dorff pop up at the end the ending itself was kind of nice but it couldn t erase what had gone on before sick morbid pitch black comedy a 1,0
20137,there are worse ways to spend an evening than watching this movie although it is a tad predictable drew barrymore does a very good job of being the outcast nerd in this film excellent casting choice what i found a bit hard to believe is that the popular girls finally accept her in my experience that crowd has a longer memory than that and knowing how awful drew s character was ostrich feathers at the start of the school year would have kept them miles away regardless of what rumors her brother drums up and does kole slaw food really make him all that popular i doubt it as for rooting for drew s character to win big as a reporter well i would have hoped she could have come up with a story long before the prom a bit contrived having said all that it was a cutsie piece of fluff that will be entertaining as long as you don t expect too much,1

16879,i was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development fulci was a master at creating horrific atmosphere using inventive camera work vivid cinematography and yes wonderfully explicit gore this film is no exception however compared to his later films the beyond zombie 2 city of the living dead house by the cemetery etc the characters here are extremely well developed and the emphasis shies away from the supernatural and is more on the suspense created by a classic who dunnit amongst the lush hills of italy the scenery is at moments reminiscent of cherished folklore and then immediately contrasted by mud and blood soaked terror shrouded by crumbling ruins the gore in this film is not quite as prevalent and seems restrained compared to fulci s later films however splatter and giallo fans will most likely be satiated by a few close ups of oozing wounds and the last 5 minutes of the film overall a fantastic and mature film from one of our great italian horror directors,1
24978,a bumbling error at the ministry of education results in nutbourne boys school having to share with st swithin s school for girls this bemuses the respective head teachers of each school and leads to all manner of chaotic goings on however the two are forced to come to an uneasy alliance in the hope of averting major trouble the happiest days of your life is based on the john dighton play from 1948 with dighton writing the part of headmistress whitchurch specifically for margaret rutherford replacing george howe from the play in the role of headmaster pond is alastair sim and here in lies the crowning glory of this filmic adaptation sim rutherford are perfectly wonderful bouncing off each other to keep what is basically a one joke movie highly entertaining directed by the gifted frank launder and produced by the equally adroit sidney gilliat the happiest days of your life is a quintessentially british movie obviously a precursor to the st trinians franchise the film entertains the children with it s high jinks clash of the sexes heart whilst tickling the watching adults with its very saucy undercurrent thankfully the chaotic ending cements all that has gone before it to leave this particular viewer with a grin as wide as nutbourne rail station great fun 8 10,1
235,i came across this film on the net by fluke and i was horrified by its content of vivid abuse violence and torture scenes it was a relief to know it was not real after reading the comments what dangerously sick animals of a person make something like this and for what purpose goes beyond belief i was even more shocked to see people appraising the film in the comments section of this site this is a extremely disturbing film indeed which could change your life forever the people behind this should be bought to justice asap today they shown a girl getting raped and butchered on screen tomorrow it could be a child even its fake or not its very very deathly disturbing nauseating indeed,0
10785,this film is striking only in its banality and use of cliches sadly it was obvious throughout up until the ending but don t be mistaken into thinking that it ended strongly only a little unexpectedly though nothing worth watching the thing through for from the taciturn and wronged hero to the germanic baddy to the expendable team the characters were entirely wooden and obvious the two fbi agents smith and wesson geddit gave some hope of humour but that came to nothing i am a big science fiction fan but it is hard to find any redeeming quality in this film a turkey,0
3394,i completely disagree with the previous reviewer this movie has amusing moments but hardly a laugh riot unless you really think sipping from a septic tank and heads exploding in a vice are a laugh riot in fact the only reasons i gave this a 2 instead of a 1 are because a two of the actors are decent b the soundtrack is above average with some tuneful pop songs thrown in for contrast and c the monster truck is pretty terrifying other than that this is a movie with some intermittent creepy or interesting ideas which are overwhelmed by unrelenting crassness crudity and vileness the former best friend character is one of the most annoying i ve ever seen and the small grace that the hitchhiker character had disappears in yet another contrived twist ending that makes little to no sense at all a waste of the lead actor who shows some nervous charm and the aforementioned actress portraying the hitchhiking character,0
13090,art imitates life imitates art atticus finch is reincarnated into the d a in this tragic and suspenseful gripping documentary that plays more like a who done it and how did it happen the authenticity and sometimes reluctant honesty of the individuals make this a compelling story in many layers although racism is one of the themes there are other elements such as work ethic integrity and coping with grief that have drawn me back to view and review this film again and again the music is driving but not obtrusive the pacing and visuals are such that there is no mistaking the fact that these are real people going through an authentic experience,1
6506,good lord this movie needs to have a new classification on its cover watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do i am disappointed i was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine but this movie didn t do it a reasonably good story but pretty awful acting dialogue and filming it was disjointed and sometimes outright silly we had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera people talking out loud by themselves and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen shadows of equipment in some shots silly clich s like i just need you to hold me in the totally wrong places and situations thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if i d offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money,0
5088,to be entirely frank the popularity of this show saddens me inuyasha is certainly not terrible it has a few good moments the occasional flash of clever humour and unlike so many animes dignity however it is utterly lacking in the essential elements of a worthwhile story from the start its premise dooms it to be stereotypical the main plot centers around collecting the pieces of a shattered jewel before they can be possessed by evil and is as one would suspect a totally generic epic fantasy affair the story follows a familiar pattern of fighting off various enemies for pieces of the jewel and is thus quite predictable lacking in complexity and easy to lose interest in but as so many animes have shown a poor premise can be rescued by deep realistic characters sadly no one rescues the story of inuyasha kagome the main character is the stereotypical anime heroine and far too reminiscent of akane the main character of the original comic author s previous work ranma 1 2 she is kind to other females but treats many males especially her love interest with unfair unabashed unjustifiable brutality inuyasha is a tough on the outside but sweet on the inside type and miroku is the lamentable stock character of the pervert the flaws continue with what happens to this plot and these characters namely nothing despite constant action the story does not progress despite regular romantic moments neither does the main relationship despite ample time the characters never really change and to add a cherry to the sundae of mediocrity all this stagnation is stretched into approximately 150 episodes my final criticism of this anime is the animation while certainly not ugly it displays almost disrespectful laziness on the part of the creators the animators seem to take joy in long scenes of inuyasha jumping through the air with wind whistling in which they have little to do but move a background in short with all the beautiful animations of the world at one s keyboard perched fingertips there is absolutely no reason to watch inuyasha,0
22716,corniness warning as many fellow imdb users already know i m not a corny cheesy person if you don t want to read this kind of review then go to tell you the truth you re hearing this from a man who laughed through titanic and almost broke his parents tape from continuously rewinding the propeller scene spoilers one day i went off to the theatres with two friends to see dickie roberts former child star last year in august the boring trailers rolled on until one started off so calmly it was for radio the moment i saw the trailer i just had to see this movie on opening weekend when that weekend rolled along scary movie 3 was out too so many teenagers were there waiting in line that friday night it turns out the movie sold out and those teens were so desperate to see a movie they went and also sold out good boy and radio i couldn t get a ticket and the following weeks i was busy with more important things about 5 months later my friend rented radio he let me borrow it and i watched it in my room i ll tell you this now this is the only movie i have ever seen that got me crying ever when radio s mother died it just came out automatically the next day i went off to blockbuster and bought the dvd well enough of my stupid personal story let me tell you about the movie cuba gooding jr stars as a mentally challenged man nick named radio ed harris co stars and this movie is directed by mike tollin based on a true story radio is a teenager who has a life by spending most of his day alone he goes around with a shopping cart picking up whatever he can and is always carrying a radio around he s got his own collection at the end of every day he goes home to his mother he never went to school until later in the film one day radio passes by the local high school while the football team is practicing a football flies over the fence and radio picks it up and continues on ed harris plays mr jones the football coach they meet and this is the life of radio throughout the whole movie radio and coach jones spend quality time together both teaching each other things it is beautiful to see how the movie goes to the highest joys the lowest lows and just seeing radio live his life you will laugh cry and live the life of radio with him this movie holds a special place in my heart along with toy story and others this is a must see for the whole family by yourself or if you re someone who just wants a great drama radio is one of the most beautiful movies i have ever seen radio will never be forgotten by me never as ed harris character said greatly near the end of the movie we re not teaching radio radio is teaching us my rating 8 10eliason a,1
24442,one of the most interesting things is that this 1988 film is highly touted as an in name only sequel there s nothing wrong with that except this the return of chevy chase as ty webb this connects the viewer to this character from the original caddyshack in 1980 and makes fans thinking or wanting caddyshack ii to be similar to the first one there are rumors that rodney dangerfield was supposed to return he carried a big part of the first film so his return would have put caddyshack 2 over the top jackie mason is the new rodney for this movie and does a decent job even though their comic deliveries are way different dan aykroyd was great but not in the film enough he should have been involved to the tune of how much screen time bill murray got in the first one robert stack airplane was good in the new ted knight villian role we miss you ted danny noonan should have been back so many others could have returned to show us what happened to their characters eight years later bushwood should not have undergone the total makeover it did instead the characters involved rather than the club itself should have been the main focus like they were in the first one when you watch this film keep in mind that it isn t a major sequel and you may think it s another good or bad eighties comedy fans of the first should see it but don t be shocked when the comparisons between the original and part ii are so far apart,1
10273,but certainly a serious contender for one of the worst 10 of all time i got this dvd cheap with sandra bullock as headliner on the case this is false advertising she s on screen for almost 10 minutes of the movie on the other hand there was no other selling point for this movie the dialog was horrible the editing was apparently done by someone who was strung out on quaaludes the directing was well let s just say that my 14 yo daughter could do better but i hope she never sees such faint praise from me it s possible that the family cat could have done better sandra does a creditable job for a first film in the short time she s on screen and that s the only redeeming quality of this film stupid story poorly written and transferred to film as only a 7th grade media class should be able to do in short this is dreck,0

16992,i ve never seen a movie get a worse release then this and that s a shame as this is the funniest film of the year you would think an ad with the line from the director of office space would be enough to warrant a big release but there are no ads no posters no website i doubt the stars even knew it came out this weekend what is 20th century fox thinking mike judge s sci fi comedy is set in 2505 but it could come true in about 10 years if things continue as they are luke wilson and maya rudolph get frozen in a top secret army experiment and wake up in a future full of consumer zombie inbred retards the film reminds me of woody allen s sleeper robocop planet of the apes blade runner and network and the late great futurama try to see it before fox burns all the prints,1

16218,despite all the hoopla about the trouble with tribbles episode the balance of terror might just be the best episode of the series and while i have always loved a piece of the action because it is so much fun i really do have to cast my vote as this romulan episode as being the very best the movie interestingly enough is really like a wwii submarine movie in that it bounces back and forth between the cloaked romulan ship and the enterprise as it seeks to destroy the romulans before they sneak back across the neutral zone after a raid on federation outposts in so many ways the show is much like the film the enemy below where the american captain robert mitchum and the german captain curt jurgens are shown in counter point as they both try to outwit the other and in the process develop a grudging respect for their foe interestingly enough only a short bit of the beginning of the episode takes place on a planet and this is amazing because an episode on board ship could easily have been static and dull but because the writing was so fantastic and the main characters written and acted so well shatner and mark leonard as the romulan leader oddly for the die hard trekkers out there they ll recognize leonard as the same actor who later played spock s father the bottom line is this is simply a great and extremely engaging episode that will keep you on the edge of your seat,1
6801,this film is great i watched it with some friends and we thought it was proof that a film doesn t have to see commercial success to be a hit is what i would love to be able to say about this film in the words of the film itself you are very very bad i went to see an unlicensed acupuncturist once so generally agree with the moral of the film though i d include a spoiler but the lack of plot makes this very tricky overall a cinematic disaster quotes you re not a leper at all you re beautiful and i bet you re nice too have you ever seen a naked man s body you couldn t break a piece of straw cameos in dubbing micheal cane x3 harold bishop steve erwine benjamin netinyahoo yoda,0

4360,steve martin has always had my respect for being a very funny comedian and a pretty good actor and i loved planes trains and automobiles and bowfinger but bringing down the house definately isn t one of martin s funniest works and it doesn t even seem as if it s trying to be which is just plain sad i don t know maybe i didn t like this movie because of the fact that i rented it along with harry potter and the chamber of secrets and phone booth both of which are excellent films or maybe it s because i m used to so much better from martin or maybe it s just because i m in a frickin bad mood today regardless this film just wasn t very funny or entertaining and i never managed more than a smile or a weak chuckle at the film s gags which is really a shame since the previews of this comedy were so promising i was expecting bringing down the house to be an all out comedy bash and i certainly expected more slapstick comedy and inter racial laughs from martin instead we re treated to seeing queen latifah jiggle all over the screen trying to do her best with her totally uninspired character the funniest thing in this clunker is eugene levy but even he doesn t get the screen time he deserves i would ve really liked to enjoy bringing down the house but i didn t and i d find it very difficult to recommend it to anyone but the most die hard steve martin fans skip this one and rent planes trains and automobiles instead you ll have a much better time,0

11296,this movie is really bad trying to create scientific explanations for zombies always ends up taking away credibility from the history of the movie there are so many things i could point about the movie that i could almost write a book on how much the movie sucks for instance there were like 50 people on the plane they killed like 100 and they kept coming apparently the virus gives hepatic complications because everybody had yellow eyes also the virus makes people roar like lions or something and the virus not only regenerates tissue as it also gives superhuman strength not to mention that this virus messes up peoples hair it s also important to notice that if you shoot someone with a pistol probably only happens on planes that person is kicked back in the air remember that if you are escorting a prisoner on a plane and you loose him always look inside the drawers and cabinets the size of a bottle you never know where those bastards are going to hide and if by any chance you can land a plane full of zombies against a mountain and survive happens all the time after watching dozens of people being killed just walk away from the plane watching the sunrise and making jokes about dating the flight attendant,0

11876,i was surprised that the makers of this movie actually came out said that this movie was a true story the majority of the scenes looked fake to me for instance when the one girl was eating her sandwich and there was a roach in it while she was eating the sandwich the camera on the opposite side of it showed that there was a roach on it it s funny how the camera just happened to be filming on the sandwich when the girl was eating it another scene is when the gang went to open a clothes closet and a cat flew out of the closet or should i say it was thrown out to give it effect this movie was not realistic at all it s highly doubtful that the events that happened were true that evening when the st francisville experiment took place i believe that the house may be haunted but not on the night this movie was filmed the ending was amusing when tim and and other girl were chained down in the some sort of basement paul and madison found them and rescued them i would rather watch the blair witch project again then have to sit through the st francisville experiment movie again as i said if the makers of the movie did not state that this was a true story with true events i may have like it more your better off getting more entertainment from the blair witch project even though this is not a true story either,0

4227,it s a pity to throw away such a good idea the main idea of the movie is travel into past lives which fortunately is not a time travel but a journey inside man which has nothing to do with the past or the future maybe they shouldn t be called past lives at all in the film now that i think of it another minus i guess it s all in the present in a different space very interesting without causing much religious distress however the music is totally repetitive melodramatic sentimental and out of place not to mention western there should have been more variety and more thought on where there should be music and where there shouldn t the flashback romantic scenes take a lot of space and running time and are totally unnecessary the acting is not bad although the language has kept me from understanding better i believe the idea needed a little more thought developing and unfoldment the inside scenes could have had better background settings because in many cases they seem unreal as a whole i would say that this movie leaves a lot to be desired,0
9766,preposterous twaddle executed in a bewilderingly amateurish and inept way or perhaps several since the incredible lack of continuity tone realism plausibility suspense and much more combine with walter pidgeon s bovine attempts at charm to produce a cinema curiosity to rank with some of fritz lang s other stupendous failures i thought the german ambassador was actually played by lang but apparently not they could have been twins if you cannot predict the ending from several timezones away you are not actually alive i was eagerly awaiting this dvd and was totally surprised and disappointed by such dire crap even with george sanders and john carradine maybe i can wash my mind out by watching viaggio in italia instead and for the umpteenth time anyone want a dvd used once there may be a movie to be made about the making of this atrocious film and how so many talented people could be wasted so completely,0
5878,how does anyone keep on seeing horror movies after this one really this one it s so bad that makes me sick and love horror movies but come on who could had remembered to do such a awful movie it as no history it s only a men who chases a bunch of teenagers because they take something from him and what have they took gold it s typical the movie is boring from the beginning until the end and what is karen black who is a great actress doing in such a ridiculous movie like this but what can i say i think everyone should see it because my opinion is my opinion may be you would like i don t think so but,0
20575,another period piece for chen kiage can t remember him doing a modern film good characterization with a simple story of trust and broken promises none of the hk fighting scenes or the hollywood type of heroes but it is good because of it the characters are strong i really felt for them understanding the mandarin definitely gives the english subtitles the edge the film is 3 hours but it didn t feel like it,1
6241,ugh even the ever popular diane lane could not save this movie and the most exciting thing about the movie was seeing if rourke s face would move one has heard so much gossip about his botched face lift etc so like an accident on the side of the road we just had to slow down and see the wreck the plot was thin here we have a very professional mob hit man who somehow latches on to a wild and uncontrollable punk crook and throughout this movie we re wondering why this guy stays with this idiot let alone gets together with the guy in the first place then the crime that was not even committed has the pro to go after the witnesses he would have popped them right then and there but then we would not have had a movie then would we and why did the realtor even agree to the extortion there were more holes in this flick than in my colander the acting was horrid the entire movie predictable down to the minute and even the ending and so much could have been done to make this a much better movie but if you have about 90 minutes to kill and not have to use any brain cells in the process then this movie is just what the doctor ordered,0
10700,i laughed at the movie the script the acting please don t we deserve better but now the filming some of the camera angles were interesting i did enjoy the film but it s not to be taken seriously though i liked it if it had a new cast and scriptwritter it would be better than all right it s worth a look,0
5959,recap a band of five young american men all that is left of a platoon hit hard during the ardenne offensive during the wwii get the assignment as a forward outpost and to look for enemy activity they re in really bad condition both physically and mentally and think they have struck gold when their outpost is in an abandoned but once plush mansion full with food but after a while there is some enemy activity and it is very odd not hostile but odd it seems like there is a german squad out there in equally bad condition that want nothing more than to surrender comments based on a novel and my guess that the novel is much better but the story doesn t seem to translate very well to the big screen indeed it is a different war movie much more about the mental pressure during wartimes than fighting and battles but i can almost feel that scenes that must have been full of suspense full of uncertainties and unknown elements just fall flat in the movie it is not suspenseful just different and in many ways absurd many times people just act insane and the reasons are unclear or at best hinted at so when this mental pressure fails to come through the main building piece of the entire story i thought the story fell through it wasn t good it wasn t interesting it didn t keep me on the edge and it didn t really send a message actually it did nothing the cast is interesting many young actors that then turned into stars in beginning of their careers the acting is good but not stellar and a few characters also fell through into the absurd zone much of that too i feel is due to that this story these characters need the time space and pace given in a novel that they can t be given here and going halfway definitely isn t good enough 4 10,0
13591,ab tak chhappan is a fictitious story surrounding a police department in mumbai india sadhu agashe is a hard working hard edged cop heading up a plain clothed crime squad who makes a name for himself by killing dangerous criminals in staged police encounters rather than locking them up in prison his loyal officers obey him without question but a rift forms when one of his officers imtiaz becomes frustrated by sadhu s high ranking status and is secretly competing with him for criminal kills and status a new recruit is also pushed into the fraternity and imtiaz is angry when sadhu allows him to take the lead on his first case further change comes in the form of a new police commissioner who disapproves of sadhu s tactics and everyone gets caught up in internal politics i was surprised to see such a well directed action thriller coming from india the camera work is excellent the story is well told and the tension is high when the drama unfolds the acting pace and political subterfuge convinces the viewer that they are a fly on the wall witnessing the blood sweat and tears from a close up and personal view and that the events are based on reality which is no doubt why we are told that it is not at the beginning of the film although it is likely that the director shimit amin has taken liberties with factual accounts nevertheless ab tak chhappan is an extremely polished piece of film making,1
8173,ah the sci fi channel how often do you disappoint me quite often i think do you ever show good movies ok you have given me the great heroes and the reasonably good the lost room but they are series and as for the movie well there really is nothing positive to say bad acting bad directing terrible characters and a shallow story and that is just for starters i checked out the director allan a goldstien and was not surprised to find nothing of interest in his resume in fact i am half thinking that this is a pseudo name the premises of four motor bikers out motto crossing in a national park when one of them has an accident that needs a park ranger to come rescue them only for them to get caught in a forrest fire is weak and predictable that you know every beat before it happens leading man bryan genesse the park ranger is so bad it is terrible cast as the action hero martial arts boy in the footsteps of so many others this guy makes seagal and van damme look like de nero the supporting cast are little better and well before the end one was left hoping the fire would engulf them all then the film crew avoid at all costs,0
5468,to be honest the movie was so horrible that i loved it never in my life have a seen such a terrible movie i was in shock i mean i don t even know what to say the characters couldn t even keep their own guns one minute a guy had an m16 and his friend had an mp5 then in the next scene they switched guns don t ask trust me i know my guns and i will never understand how they got from a place that looked like vietnam to an arizona highway to my backyard and then to a chemical plant in california that is what i took from it why would you be afraid of a guy in a halloween mask wearing a trash bag for a cape and shot plastic arrows at you how is that frightening i wanted to swallow arsenic halfway through the movie i love how the skeleton man randomly decided to go on a killing spree at that particular day but hey whoever made this movie should be shot in the knees and fed to a mound of fire ants good day,0
13795,lt claude claudio cassinelli and several prisoners from his sunken ship wash ashore on an island owned by edmond rackham richard johnson following a few random prisoner deaths rackham takes in claude and his two remaining prisoners luckily for everyone barbara bach just happens to be on the island too unluckily there are some crazy fishmen who like to kill people this italian produced exploiter seems to have it all a touch of creature from the black lagoon mixed with dr moreau with a dash of white zombie voodoo and atlantis stuff despite some wonky looking fishmen costumes the film does benefit from some beautiful location photography and a nice twist about halfway through all of the actors are good and joseph cotton even pops up as a old biologist director sergio martino handles himself well enough as there is action ever 10 minutes or so that can t be said for his belated follow up the fishmen and their queen 1995 easily one of the wackiest and most off base sequels since highlander ii,1
9397,when you see barry corbin in the cast of a movie you can never be sure if it will be a classic or trash guess which category solo falls into apparently derived from a popular sci fi novel weapon solo stars mario van peebles as a human looking robot who decides to think for himself and is thus targeted for elimination he hides out in a mexican village obviously to save money on locations and extras paying in pesos is cheaper than paying in dollars i suspect william sadler is along for the ride as one of the robots and soldiers sent to destroy van peebles van peebles manages to beat them all with ease of course while corbin watches all this with bemusement from afar the movie is a horrible ripoff of the the terminator and cyborg series and apparently has little to do with its source material it is horribly written and acted and the big fight at the end if downright comical van peebles a decent actor elsewhere is a scream as he pretends to be a robot covered in synthetic flesh he looks like he is doing the robot dance most of the time,0
635,you have to see this movie it s a big footnote in the history of film when this film was made american film industry reached the bottom of sucking see this movie laugh and feel sorry for yourself for wasting the last 2 hours of your life it s the worst acting i ve seen and even worse directing the villains laugh like they re taken from a clown circus and if the guys who did scary movie want to do a parody on superhero movies they only have to take the script from this movie and do a remake called black scorpion iii the threat of really really bad movies who in some way manages to lure the production companies into a sequel suicide,0
11045,ok i admit that i still associate sophie marceau with la boum that was the main reason i went to see this film but it was so boring that i nearly felt asleep sorry but her talents as actress are not very convincing furthermore this film was presented as having outstanding special effects and cgi yeah for a b movie it is not that bad after having seen her in marquise some years ago also a very crappy film i thought that she would play more convincingly but la boum and may be the james bond the world is not enough seem to be the only good films with her is it her talent does she have a bad taste when choosing her films or simply bad luck,0
7357,see i really wanted to enjoy this movie there were moments when my heart beat faster when the hair on my neck began to stand up when my muscles began to tighten but just like a strip tease i was left with no real action no resolution and money missing from my wallet jaume balaguer and miguel tejada flores apparently don t know the correct recipe for making a horror movie and as such utilized the old amateur cook s method of throwing everything into the pot this movie is really the shining poltergeist amityville and hellraiser all rolled into one amazing i know but true all the flavors are there you can taste each of them they just don t mix well i m not gonna go down the list of every thing wrong with this movie in short good cinematography mediocre acting worse dialogue the real problem with stealing from so many movie plots and combining them into one movie aside from the resulting confusion is while you can have several plots running at one time you can t have several endings and what does jaume do when he runs into this problem just like a freshman in english 101 you end your story with ellipses the little car vanished into the darkness and the end oooh spooky not really and very anticlimactic the ending left me confused and disappointed almost empty take your 10 go rent the shining poltergeist and hellraiser scare the pants off yourself have a great time and forget that the darkness ever existed bjamin,0
23427,shadows is often acclaimed as the film that was the breakthrough for american independent cinema whether thats true or not it is an undeniably important film one whose influence can be traced all the way to today s sundance fodder here is a film which tackles controversial topics of the day namely racism and refuses to give easy answers and show them in a manipulative fashion also it deals with sex in a frank manner that hollywood wouldn t even discuss until the graduate still the question remains is it as powerful today as when it was originally released the answer is yes while many important films are hard to watch and dated nowadays shadows retains every ounce of emotional resonance when viewed now it deals with racism as a personal issue and not a political one so its still relevant plus it works as a great time capsule capturing the 1950s beat generation and new york art scene in a way possibly no other film has on a technical level its admittedly uneven cassavetes had yet to gain full confidence as a director and the choppy editing reflects the film s low budget still the film s story is remains powerful plus the acting considering the inexperience of the cast and improvisational nature is phenomenal all around the actors create realistic characters ones who remain sympathetic despite their often less than admirable actions shadows is absolutely mandatory viewing for film buffs 9 10,1
5870,a group of douche bag teenagers go up to an old mining town in hopes of finding gold nuggets the one hitch in the hair brained scheme is that the ancient supernatural miner whom the gold belongs to doesn t wish to part with his treasure so easily and so begins to dispatch the interlopers accordingly literally clich sprouting dialog horrible acting some insanely terrible southern dialect and a lame unmemorable killer who resembles jeepers creepers without the aforementioned s predilection of young boys naturally combine to make this stinker just about unwatchable even cult legend actress karen black in a small role can t save this aberration eye candy elina madison shows badly lit t a my grade d where i saw it tmcx,0
16024,i didn t have very high expectations about just before dawn i don t know why i keep buying these slasher movies when i know it s all the same every time maybe i m a bit masochistic anyway i m glad i bought this one yes it s all the same no it has nothing original yes it s about a little group of teenagers going in the woods to camp drink and have sex yes they get killed one by one by a maniac and you know what it s just magic it s one of the best experiences i had watching a slasher movie the places where it s shot are so wonderful you see mountains waterfalls rockies it s just amazing it takes a very long time except for the opening scene before the killer starts killing but i didn t care it was enjoyable to watch enough not to care what i mean is you won t be sitting there waiting for the murders to start because every thing that happens is enjoyable because of the beauty of the film itself the ending is a bit weird but i won t tell you anything more about it you ll know what i mean another thing i enjoyed you care about the characters they re not just a bunch of jerks who spend their time bitching each other sure they are pure stereotypes of usual slasher characters but there s something special about them anyway it s a great horror movie and i hope you have a pretty good time watching it because i really did,1
10016,this would probably be a good film to see provided you ve already seen every other film in existence and thoroughly explored the bellybuttons of yourself and those around you god this movie was unbelievably insipid with some of the worst or is it nonexistent writing ever captured on film there is no saving grace to this film even the animatronics are kind of lame and it s just a complete waste of time and money run fast it s beyond horrible,0
21135,hitchcock would be proud of this movie even when nothing happens it is suspenseful director david lynch overuses a few cheap thrill tricks here and there but he intersperses them with other cinematographic techniques to keep it from becoming obtuse altogether surreal this movie is like waking up and remembering most of a dream but not enough to make it sensible i am still trying to figure it all out and will probably have to see it again to catch things i missed and which may help me understand it better it is a very detailed plot that very slowly comes together so you must be patient and pay attention get your bathroom trip out of the way before it starts and yet the plot is overshadowed by the theme the mood the character development and the filming techniques the dual roles of the main actress naomi watts showcase her enormous talent that is when i could get my eyes off of her co star what an acting pair lynch surprises throughout the movie with unusual camera angles the length timing of editing cuts jumping back and forth between scenes combined with smart use of music and sounds it all helps to build suspense in our minds doubtless a major objective of the director well he kept me on the edge of my seat even had me talking to the actors to be careful here and not be so naive there you know the kind of stuff you want to smack your kids for doing at the movies,1
24147,take away all parts of the movie that were present day and stick to the flashbacks then you would have had a great story faith and wolf s story and their relationship was the best part diaz and eccleston were wonderful brewster was ponderous to sit through surprised to see blythe danner as mom she was great also look for patrick bergen as the father always like him sleeping with the enemy this is a very hippy save the world kind of film don t care for it much but i recommend seeing it for diaz s performance alone she has excellent range and it should be used more eccleston is as always compelling he s wonderful,1
13410,i hate football i hate football fans i hate cars but this film was the funniest thing i have seen in quite some time i was given the great opportunity to see this film at the weekend and all i have to say is i laughed till i cried and when is it going to be available in the uk and denmark girls this is one football film you will need to see its hilarious the fact that this film started out as some crazy commercial for a telephone company is just amazing the guys may not be well known actors but this is good down to earth real humour with real people and i for one applaud them for taking this to the screen well done,1
21213,i watched fantabulosa because over the last few years michael sheen has become one of my favourite actors and if you haven t seen him in anything before firstly shame on you and secondly get your hands on a copy of either heartlands or dirty filthy love this production did not disappoint michael sheen transformed himself almost magically into kenneth williams and gave a performance that was as tragically moving as it was skillful not to take anything away from the other performances but like kenneth michael truly stole the show i don t know how he does it but every performance i have seen michael give he seems to metamorphose until the character he plays is truly utterly believable and no matter how hard i try i cannot fault him must go get my tea enjoy,1
12039,for native mongolian speakers the film lacked emotion and emphasis used too many non native speakers especially jamukha too many diversions from the actual history terrible terrible subtitle i wonder where and who did that subtitle it was both in english and thai i wonder how bad the subtitle was in thai if the english subtitle was soooo bad described the one of the greatest leader s life very uninteresting there are better films made by mongolian directors with very low budget from 1980 s honestly i m wondering if the film critics of academy award is that lenient or what only good thing was some good cgi in some fighting scenes only moderately not over the top cgi,0
17386,it has been almost 50 years since i saw jennifer for the first and only time i did not know the name of this movie until i looked it up on this web site but i have told many people especially my grandchildren how movies do not have to include graphic details in order to frighten you and leave powerful impact the story skillfully introduces you to concepts which if true put ida lupino in a very dangerous situation each time miss lupino discovers a new fact she draws the viewer into her confusion and fear this movie has such impact on me that almost 50 years later i still list it as one of the most frightening movies that i have ever seen yet this movie does not contain the blood and gore which became popular shortly after this movie was made it s amazing what impact a good story and great actors can make,1
12206,when i first saw the previews for this movie on tv i thought that this could be a funny movie i was wrong all though i am not totally against movies that make fun of others some are actually funny such as the first scary movie this was one of many that have been made as of late that are not the humor in this film was anything but funny and was rather dull i feel the one of the biggest problems is that they poked fun at to many movies such as varsity blues friday night lights stick it etc and if you are anything like me you try to pick out each movie instead of paying attention to whats going on in this one even the adult humor in this movie was dry do yourself a favor and save you money and time and rent don t rent this movie,0
22578,i went into night of the hunted not knowing what to expect at all i was really impressed it is essentially a mystery thriller where this girl who can t remember anything gets rescued by a guy who happens to be driving past the two become fast friends and lovers and together they try to figure out what is going on with her through some vague flashbacks and grim memories they eventually get to the bottom of it and the ending is pretty cool i really liked the setting of this one a desolate post modern paris is the backdrop with lots of gray skies and tall buildings very metropolitan groovy soundtrack and lots of nudity surprising it was made in 1980 seems somewhat ahead of it s time 8 out of 10 kids,1

10188,john wayne is without a doubt one of the most popular and loved actors of all time his career stretched over forty years and within that time he starred in films such as angel and the badman the green berets sands of iwo jima rio bravo north to alaska and the undefeated the film s listed above are hailed as some of his best unlike this 1934 effort randy rides alone which has been pretty much forgotten about as time s gone on which is unsurprising as it s nothing memorable apart from its very short running time of just 53 minutes a young john wayne plays randy bowers who for reasons never really explained arrives at a saloon in the middle of nowhere and finds that everyone inside has been killed while looking around a posse arrives and finds randy there and they arrest him accusing him of being a gang member and demand to know where the rest of his gang is he is put in jail accused of the murders sally rogers whose uncle owned the saloon and was murdered arrives at the jail to see randy in order to clarify that he was one of the gang members she was hiding in a secret room when the shooting took place sally doesn t believe that randy is a killer and doesn t recognise him so while the sheriff is out she slips him the keys and randy escapes while running away from the sheriff and his posse randy conveniently stumbles into the gang s hideout in a cave who were responsible for the murders randy sets out to clear his name and also to bring the gang to justice randy rides alone can be a fun film to watch especially if you re a john wayne fan but at the same time it has far too many flaws that are impossible to ignore the film is also extremely dated as you would expect we have the terrible camera shooting which makes everyone look like they are moving in super fast motion and the dialogue is terrible the acting isn t great either and wayne s character is very wooden and he along with the rest of the cast look like wooden puppets who are being conducted by someone in this case it s by director harry fraser harry fraser is at the helm and does a good enough job but the story is paper thin one can t help but feel that about ten minutes is missing from the start of the film as randy just arrives out of nowhere at the saloon and is looking to meet someone an explanation on why randy was there is giving later on which turns out to be something like he is a p i who was sent to investigate the claims that someone is trying to take over the town to be honest i didn t really pick it up most of the time i was hoping for the movie to end but that being said i didn t find this film to be completely terrible i enjoyed some of it and found it to be quite fun at times but it really isn t a great film and isn t really worth watching or tracking down overall randy rides alone is incredibly dated and is a tiresome western with very few redeeming qualities can be fun but overall it isn t a great movie and is certainly one of wayne s weaker outings,0
3490,request you to not watch this movie it starts with a promise and as it goes on you crave for the movie to end predictable not entertaining at all wasted movie save your time and watch better thrillers the synopsis sounds good and that is why i watched the movie but it was way too predictable with nothing to give you a start no great suspense no great direction nothing phenomenal with the acting shy away from this low rating nothing to write about this movie so i am filling up the remaining lines of text so you can imagine how much a time waster this movie is really irritated at how good a premise that was and how bad a screenplay was written out of it,0
15581,i came across this movie in an australian hotel room at 3 am my brother and i were channel surfing and who do we see but a young russel crowe but not the telephone throwing russel crowe we had come to know and quasi love back in the states this movie much to my surprise was amazingly creative and hilarious it stars a cast of awkward teens with hilarious stories of odd sexual experiences including a slick salesman prostitutes and an unusual sexy mother if you are lucky enough to come across this film i would strongly suggest picking it up i have to say this movie was amazingly entertaining and i thank the fine people of australia making it,1
5765,the hebrew hammer is a clever idea wasted as the execution is weak as if often the case with iconoclastic humor it relies overly on outrage to generate laughs which simply isn t enough poor taste humor has two elements poor taste and humor and both are needed here but the humor is pretty scarce as a result it is often painful to watch all the more so because of good attempts on the part of the performers particularly adam goldberg as the hh himself the shaft references are funny though but only to those who know those movies and they certainly don t carry the hebrew hammer another problem is that many of the jokes rely on knowledge of american jewish culture and many in the audience will simply not understand the jokes,0
699,this movie was difficult for me to watch stan looked very old and ill compared to what i remembered and ollie was heavier than i ever recall in another film most difficult though were gaps in the script production where i found myself wondering how did they get from here to there it took nearly half the film before i could deal with the dubbing of non american actors that was also a distraction although i miss great actors such as laurel and hardy will there ever be great actors like those of the old studio era this film helps me understand why actors sometimes bow out in their prime,0
1733,tycus is almost as bad as a science fiction film can go i can hardly find something good to say about this film the premises are completely wrong a comet is supposed to hit the moon and cause catastrophic damage to earth but nobody believes the scientist who predicts this a whole underground city plus a launching pad for nuclear armed rockets is build in the california mountains without anybody noticing when the comet nears earth the news make it to the tv and newspapers hardly a day before the event and so on and so on neither does any kind of emotion make it to the screen is the genius who discovers the comet and builds the underground city a savior of humanity or a beast the director or dennis hooper who is playing the role did not seem to decide until the film was done and actually it does not make any difference because acting and directing is so confusing that you end by wondering what does this film try to say the special effects are so cheap that not only that they cannot be convincing in the era of computer effects but they could not have been convincing even in the 50s four decades before this film was made a total waste of time,0
20094,cherry tells of a naive unmarried virgin who decides to have a baby but isn t quite sure how to go about it this easy going little sleeper is full of quirky characters and tongue in cheek situational humor fresh fun mold breaking stuff i happened to really enjoy this flick for whatever that s worth recommended for lovers of romantic comedy who want something different,1
8571,this is an example of a movie that can have great potential and is executed very poorly i am a fan of kids and thumb sucker and many other so called teen angst films but this one bugged me why is every white kid made into a thug who loves rap its getting to be one dimensional the acting was awful but simple since it mainly consisted of just dropping f bomb after f bomb just a bad bad movie if you d like to see better movies like this thumb sucker kids bully allthose i think are better so i recommend one of those is you d like to see a good teen movie i hope my comment you found useful and hope you hear future comments from me,0
19071,i saw this movie on the lowlands festival 23 24 25th of august after a friend of mine said this is a very cool movie about the history of skating i didn t now what to expect from this movie was it recorded by a couple of skaters who thought they could do a couple of cool tricks or was it a documentary about skating so i went in after waiting for about an hour whit out any expectations this movie is really a nice piece of work about the beginning of skateboarding it started with the zephyr team who where a fine group of surfers this is taking place in a not so nice area to live in at a certain point the waves are not so good any more to surf on so they try something else skateboarding was a fact if you were a part of the zephyr team in that time you where one of the cool guys girls because a lot of people saw an escape from the place they were living in with the zephyr team so they were trying all there new tricks now on a skateboard in no time skateboarding was popular again there were a couple of competitions and one national competition the zephyr team was taking part on several competition and also the national one but what they were doing on there skateboards was unbelievable but the jury didn t now how to judge them so they put the whole skateboarding world on it s head anyway i can tell you the rest of the film documentary but you must see this one with you re own eyes because then you can feel the vibe of this movie this movie got a lot of style for me so i rewarded it with a 8 greetings from gijs and the rest of holland see you,1
5966,after two terrorist attacks in europe one in london and the other in amsterdam the prime suspect is the leader al saleem alon aboutboul the cia agent roger ferris leonardo dicaprio that operates in the middle east is assigned by his superior at langley ed hoffman russell crowe to keep a safe house in amman under surveillance and he associates to the chief of security in jordan hani salaam mark strong roger does not disclose the whole operation to hani and it fails due to the intervention of ed meanwhile roger has feelings for the local nurse aisha golshifteh farahani and he gets close to her family when roger plots another scheme to catch al saleem using the innocent architect omar sadiki ali suliman as decoy to lure al saleem he jeopardizes not only the safety of sadiki but also aisha that is kidnapped after the execution of sadiki roger tries to negotiate the release of aisha with the terrorists and proposes to deliver himself to save the nurse body of lies is a disappointing pyrotechnical tour through europe and middle east despite the names of ridley scott leonardo dicaprio and russell crowe the imdb user rating indicates that there are many viewers that like this type of fast paced movie of espionage using high technology satellites and all sort of lack of respect to the sovereignty of other nations in the name of oil that gives no time for thinking but that is not my case it is boring and ridiculous to see the fat russell crowe with a cell phone like a family man while his partner is risking his life in a dangerous operation the rich character performed by leonardo dicaprio is poorly developed and in my opinion this great actor is miscast as an operative agent in middle east due to his biotype but the movie never explains his connections with the middle east the rescue of roger ferris alive is also very stupid and corny my vote is four title brazil rede de mentiras network of lies,0
8427,the scriptwriters directors and actors have lost sight of the cornerstone of a good story the concept of suspension of disbelief in volcano the concept goes up in smoke almost as quickly as the city contrary to earlier commentators i much preferred dantes peak amongst the 97 vintage of volcano movies,0

9444,tru calling was good but it could have been great the concept was intriguing and allowed for seriously strange and frightening story lines that might have been explored in future unfortunately the writing and an actor let the show down the writing wasn t too bad but there were holes in episode 13 drop dead gorgeous an incredibly toxic poison was supposedly used to kill the victim this was so toxic and killed so quickly the victim had no time to run or even scream for help yet there was no plausible explanation for how the killer obtained such a powerful poison in episode 15 the getaway the off duty policeman responded unrealistically in the second diner scene he meekly tells the robber to drop the gun and when she doesn t follow the order and in fact turns the gun in his direction he allows it to turn into a standoff and then escalate into a hostage situation the very situation he d been warned about his response should would have been to shoot the robber when she failed to follow his order and upon her turning the gun on him there are other faults in the stories but i ll leave it with these two examples in spite of the writing faults i did like the show the other problem i had was that i just could not accept eliza dushku in this roll in my opinion she is too inexperienced and lightweight to carry this part she never walked anywhere she marched and far too often she came to an abrupt stop on her mark she also lacked any really emotional facial expression or intonation she either has a pensive look or a cute smile rarely are other emotions apparent when she tries to appear dramatic she begins her line looking away and then turns her eyes to her fellow actor or alternatively she begins her line looking at her opposite and then looks away both are annoying when done as a replacement for true emotion an example of her lack of intonation is in episode 20 two weddings and a funeral during her second wedding speech is devoid of emotion eg hearts in our hearts i liked all of the other actors in their respective parts and they were all believable with improved writing and a lead change tru calling might have made it,0
22306,i ve heard a few comments particularly from prisoners of war that changi is not historically accurate and that it is disappointing perhaps it is for those who actually had to live through this stuff and much worse but for the rest of us who really have no idea of how prisoners were treated by the japanese during world war ii changi is a remarkable introduction but changi isn t a war documentary if it had have been then the historical accuracy aspect would have been paramount it is a miniseries drama with fictional characters and fictional situations though based loosely on actual events i ve heard and read about and at the centre of the story is the ideal of mateship this group of young australian soldiers taken prisoner by the japanese and held in appalling conditions for years became mates through adversity and the strength of their friendships continued throughout their lives after the war it is also a cultural study of the differences between the japanese of the time and the western world with its music games and entertainment in part 5 when it is becoming clear that japan will lose the war after germany has surrendered in europe the japanese prison camp colonel insists that his country must study the culture of their prisoners in order to defeat a people one must defeat their culture and to do this one must understand it all in all australia continues its rich tradition of producing exceptional television miniseries and is an unrivalled world leader in this regard vyeing for the afi award with changi is my brother jack the adaptation of george johnston s novel and also a worthy winner miniseries in recent years include day of the roses the story of the investigation into the glanville train crash kings in grass castles the adaptation of mary durack s historical account of her pioneering ancestors kangaroo palace about a group of friends from a country town in australia who travel to london and change and grow apart and the somewhat disappointing adaptation of bryce courtenay s powerful novel the potato factory less recently nancy cato s sweeping saga of life on the murray all the rivers run cusack james brilliant novel about postwar life in sydney come in spinner colleen mccullough s outstanding pioneering saga the thorn birds the river kings ruth park s novel the harp in the south bodyline eureka stockade anzacs etc etc of course there have been some not so good productions for instance moby dick do or die on the beach thorn birds the missing years etc generally though if an australian miniseries comes your way make sure you see it and this goes double for changi a superbly directed masterpiece rating 9 10,1
5450,this is one of crichton s best books the characters of karen ross peter elliot munro and amy are beautifully developed and their interactions are exciting complex and fast paced throughout this impressive novel and about 99 8 percent of that got lost in the film seriously the screenplay and the directing were horrendous and clearly done by people who could not fathom what was good about the novel i can t fault the actors because frankly they never had a chance to make this turkey live up to crichton s original work i know good novels especially those with a science fiction edge are hard to bring to the screen in a way that lives up to the original but this may be the absolute worst disparity in quality between novel and screen adaptation ever the book is really really good the movie is just dreadful,0

7280,this movie changes its way a third of the way in its totally pointless boring and stupid i hated this movie so much that i will never watch it again some bad films can be really funny this is just a british art house picture that should never of been made 1 out of 10,0
14245,saturday afternoon is one of harry langdon s best known short subjects and with good reason it is one of his funniest and best films the plot such as it is is an old staple a hen pecked husband sneaks away for a night out with a his pal and a couple of other girls it s a solid and well used comedy plot but the difference here is harry langdon himself his slow ineffectual befuddled innocent character has somehow floundered his way into a marriage with a woman who feels that he of all people must be ruled with an iron fist and he is only thrust into cheating on her because he can t say no to the exhortations of the chummy vernon dent and the cute eyelash fluttering of the girl it s a very adult problem to be thrust onto such a helpless childlike character harry doesn t want to cheat but he can t do anything about it in a wonderful bit of comic business he can t bring himself to blow the new girlfriend kiss goodbye he slyly pushes the kiss at her underhand and ashamedly wipes off his hand as if to chastise it the film is a three reel comedy ten minutes longer than the two reelers harry langdon had previously been starring in for mack sennett with no more plot perhaps it was even designed to be a two reeler this works beautifully since it gives him as much time as he needs to inject the slow reactions and bewildered glimpses and half actions where so much of his comedy lives he s at his best here and the show is really harry langdon s curious magic and ability to spin comedy out of almost nothing his little half smiles his look while handling the money he has hidden under the rug childlike attempts to enter the fight at the end i think his comedy makes us recognize something fundamentally innocent and confused in ourselves that makes us feel like the whole world is too much for us yet at the same time by allowing us to understand what harry does not such as the fact that the women he good heartedly brings to his friend to cheer him after he thinks the date has been blown are in fact whores he forces his to realize with a little bit of sadness that we are not that innocent anymore his comedy is just as capable of making us audibly say awwww as it is making us laugh often at once here harry wants to refuse to cheat on his wife he wants to tell his wife whose boss and take some power back in his relationship he wants to fight back against the two violent men at the end of the film but he just can t affect his surroundings that much and sometimes we all feel like that the film is perfectly directed by frequent langdon director harry edwards it moves at a quick pace and never stalls while at the same time making time for and presenting to best effect harry langdon s still reactive comedy vernon dent a frequent foil to langdon plays one of the roles here where he becomes almost a comedy partner in his very effective pairing with harry the gags spaced out in a way that gives maximum effect too and harry gets his own version of a lloyd or keaton style stunt at the end here the comedy is not in harry s big reactions to the danger of sitting perched between two moving cars but in his slowness to take it in this is a hilarious film and a perfect example of the comedy of one of the most unique an talented humorists that i know ever to have existed,1
1838,this is not a good film by an standards it is very poorly written and the acting is just a little above par some performances are well below par but swayze and grey do a very good job with little to work with what was good the dance sequences were choreographed very well and as stated above swayze and grey were high points what was bad the script the bad guys were simply too evil to be believable the best villains are the ones who aren t so obviously evil these guys the owner s nephew the waiter who impregnates the girl do and say nothing that would leave me to believe they could be real people perhaps there are guys like them but i sure don t want to see a movie about it another scene the first where grey and swayze meet when the employees at the resort are dancing swayze and grey dance together and seem to enjoy themselves the next time they meet swayze is hostile towards her why what happened in between to make him dislike her so when they danced well together and some of those lines i mean come on i cringed at the end when swayze muttered the line nobody puts baby in the corner how did he ever do that with a straight face another thing wrong the setting of the 1960 s everyone looked and dressed like the 1980 s who was in charge of the costumes and hairstyles the music original music for the film was laughable with the exception of i had the time of my life which was a good song not the worst film i ve ever seen but definitely the most over rated,0
4670,half of the movie is is flashing lights and shaky camera the rest is made up of predictable characters think science vs government know how vs authority etc what is the worst aspect about this movie is it the cars being thrown around in the first 5 minutes is the horrible russian accent of the cosmonaut is it the uninspired characters the poorly integrated top 40 hits or the us will save the world vitriol no it s the fact that regardless of the sad ending there is very little suspense in this movie we basically know what s going to happen the one good part of this movie american components russian components all made in taiwan,0
22457,this movie is well made it is beautiful and wise it is heart warming it is great and again it shows how great peter falk is he is fantastic and he even gets better the older he gets thank you peter falk thank you very much for this gem of a movie this movie entertains there is lot of wisdom in this movie there is lot of humor in this movie there is life in this movie and meaning this movie shows how life can be peter falk is in that movie he is just great where is the oscar for peter falk he deserves it so very much peter falk just turned 80 i do sincerely hope that there will be more movies walter j langbein,1
16662,this film is an impressionistic poetic take on the immigrant experience a reflective look at the turmoil and fear which might be associated with emigrating these are aspects not often considered in movies about emigration to america in particular and to to any country more generally and the film vividly and convincingly depicts the nervousness and enthusiasm if ignorance that poor illiterate sicilian immigrants have in anticipation of their emigration to the united states they have some fantastic unrealistic notions about the united states which are disseminated on the trip over one is that the rivers run with milk an image which is depicted in the movie to poetic impressionistic effect the film is devoid of sound and the silence seems to reflect the uneasiness of the ignorance the locals have about life in america or if not ignorance of it a vision significantly colored with superstition and fantasy that said the movie depicts with jolting realism the boat ride to the united states and the intake process which arrivals at ellis island had to undergo the boat ride is imagined as rather dull which surely it was much of the time the quarters in which the incoming residents sleep is depicted as extremely crowded with beds spaced four or five inches from one another and lacking much light which it was surely the case below deck again the film is not supplemented with undue music or excessively bright lighting and the effect is to create a fairly realistic imagining of what it was truly like for people emigrating to the united states the villagers may not be worldly but they are quite reasonable and the interaction with the eldest of the emigrants fortunata aurora quattrocchi with the immigration officer who insists on particular results are quite bittersweet inasmuch as they are not diluted or softened for the benefit of a syrupy conclusion and one sees the melding of the realism of sicily with the extensive regulations which guide life in the united states the immigrants and their story are very interesting and the combination of cold eyed realism and the magical fantasy of peoples imaginations make for a persuasive vision of the beliefs held by sicilians or any people with little formal education moving to the united states the acting is similarly barebones it is not at all demonstrative or showy but seems the more realistic for it that said all the main performers in particular salvatore mancuso vincenzo amato the clear leader of the group is excellent while never smiling his character s actions speak much louder and it is clear that thankfully the other members of the group his two sons and the above mentioned elder fortunata the boys grandmother have faith in his leadership abilities and respect his clear leadership amato imbues his character with great decency and forthrightness and it is a testament to his abilities that his character appears so capable and confident while his character betrays very little emotion one oddness of the film is a chance encounter with a mysterious englishwoman the excellent and fittingly mysterious charlotte gainsbourg who speaks italian and during the entire film we wonder why she is going to the united states or what connection she has to the otherwise unanimously sicilian emigrant group at the end this is finally revealed and the revelation is done typically realistically and does not seem particularly melodramatic or showy the film is directed by emmanuel crialese who has a firm grasp on the realistic if sometimes superstitious world view his characters inhabit and presents it competently and confidently it is in fact fantastically confident given how awkwardly the realism and superstition might have combined in the film it is a worthy examination of the immigrant experience,1
24385,people watch movies for a variety of different reasons this movie didn t have the big budget there s no special effects no car chases and there s no explosions actually reality doesn t have much of these either at least not in my life this is a very real movie about very real people none of them perfect in any way but together they are put into a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and that in turn makes order out of chaos i am not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology since i m neither an expert nor use the full extent of my own brain so watch this movie for the characters it is brim full of a whole cast of wonderful quirky folk within the first three minutes kiefer sutherland enacts detective michael hayden s life superbly and he keeps developing the character throughout the movie excellent acting very believable henry czerny could not have been cast better and the rapport between his harvey and kiefer s mickey enhances the oppositeness of their characters i thoroughly enjoyed the cranky landlady mrs ramsay i m sure she and my mother in law are good friends there s a host more of these wonderful characters but space is limited here so watch the movie and enjoy them,1
3719,this movie was very disappointing and except for a few moments wasn t fly at all more than anything it was just flippin stupid the music was frickin bad and the plot played out like a byu bowl game very predictable avoiding embarrassment by scoring a late game flurry of touchdowns a rally that falls short and leads to a loss in essence the half childish half naive will the movie s fetcher and his religiously confused brother danny we ll just call him a democrat treat kirby the movie s sweet spirit the 3rd member of their hapless mormon boy band like crap until the man and father figure of the film the stage manager jill has a talk with will and straightens him out believably will s personality changes 180 degrees and he s instantly the mature and self aware leader of the band this would be a cute perhaps funny 10 minute roadshow gig but the fact that the movie is 93 minutes long really sucks the life out of you if you watch it to the end my advise take the money you d normally spend to rent this show and either burn it in your fireplace or flush it down the toilet more entertainment with much less time commitment if you want to watch a better movie of the same genre get saints and soldiers not a comedy but an infinitely better show actually kirby has more funny stuff in saints than he does in sop,0
21056,this film is an eery but interesting film i will tell you why it is eery later in this review the film is interesting because it was the first film to ever contain sound no it may not be a one hour and forty two minute film no it may not contain great action scenes but it is still a wonderful film to me it sparked a whole knew revolution if you will of sound movies this can be a little eery to watch knowing that everyone in that film are now dead i can hear the voice of a man in the beginning who no longer walks the earth visible and that the sound is cracky and broken i recommend this video for everyone to watch this created movies as we know it today,1
22543,dashing errol flynn brings his usual flair for drama in this historically flawed but entertaining film of the life of george armstrong custer the dashing jovial flynn essays custer from his days at west point as a reckless headstrong cadet through the civil war years in an extraordinarily generous and partisan interpretation of history and finally as the nonpareil indian fighter whose blunder at the little big horn is excused as a sacrifice by custer of his command as a way of exposing the corruption of government officials and post traders as well as a protest of the unfair treatment of the plains indians olivia de havilland flynn s co star in several other films scores as the devoted adoring libby bacon and anthony quinn looks the part as the fierce sioux chief crazy horse the film s battle scenes are excellent the civil war battles are brief and are shown as several vignettes in which custer seemingly supported by just a handful of troopers hammers the confederate army into submission custer s last fight against the indians is a grand spectacle a savage clash between red men and white with no quarter given in a wild mix of military might between determined fighting men great direction cinematography casting and wonderful music by max steiner make this film a hollywood classic,1
11062,when i checked out the review for this film after i d watched it i was surprised that there were people giving it good ratings this is a film of bad camera work everything frightening happens off screen usually accompanied with a closeup of someone yelling did you see hear that well no we didn t see that we can t and when there weren t any close ups the camera was doing something weird like rotating upside down or shaking back and forth really really quickly to either convey action or to make us physically sick the characters were unlikeable because every two minutes they started screaming the same thing over and over again i don t care if that s what it would really be like i did not rent a scary movie to see reasonable things i expect unreasonable things like aliens demons or good acting they were stupid too let s go have intimate relations in a cave with all of our clothes on speaking of which the ending somewhat contradicts what domingo said immediately before he died this bugged me a bit though not nearly as much as the fact that the ending resulted in a serious invasion of one girl s privacy no plot no climax no good acting terrible camera work what s left oh right the ending may have had a twist but generally with horror movies the twist at the end actually has understandable relevance to what occurred during the film sixth sense does it explains a lot hide and seek did too but the cavern had a lame twist that served as an explanation if you could call it that as it doesn t explain anything don t see it please,0
12413,saw this at the video store and thought i d give it a try sounded like a good story and the cover looked good that was it the characters looked good and the actor who played noel was the most convincing though he didn t have any heavy time in the movie i find it really hard to give a movie a bad rating but this is one in a minute number that gets it my book as the movie went along i kept wanting it to get better but to no avail asthetically it was good the sound and lighting was good but the acting in this film killed it for me it was like watching a low grade soap opera i just kept saying i can t believe they released this move like this i paused several times out of sheer unbelief that the acting was that bad there s so much i want to say but i ll just say this everything else for the most part was good it was the acting as a final cut that really did this film in,0
22410,often considered argento s last great film this entry into the giallo canon is unquestionably better than any argento film that has followed it though i have yet to see mother of tears but to call it his last great film might be stretching it a bit the directorial and stylistic flourishes the hallmark of all argento films is indeed present with some of his sequences of suspense ranking up with his best the peephole sequence is especially memorable and the cinematography by ronnie taylor is outstanding the fluorescent lighting is beautiful however the narrative which is hit and miss in all of argento s films is missing here there is indeed a potent sense of mystery and intrigue but the plot resorts to what is essentially a string of murder sequences with one following the another leaving no real time to fully construct a right focused mystery to be solved all of this results in a climax that is well anti climatic as the film did not invest enough interest to make us truly care regardless this is recommended simply due to the masterful direction and beautiful imagery that argento evokes i wouldn t recommend this as a starting point for argento s films however for that i would recommend either deep red or suspiria but if you enjoyed those or even any giallo then this is a very good addition to your viewing repertoire,1
2790,this has to be one of the if not the worst movies i have ever seen after watching this piece of sh t i felt as though i should write to madonna and demand compensation for my time but now i feel that i should write madonna and demand a great 80s album considering she can t record a good album to save her life anymore in return for this disaster on to the movie itself which can be summed up like this it consists madonna jumping around acting like a spoiled teenager who lost her way she is trying to impress this absolute douche of an actor who plays the lawyer in the movie but the best was the ending i was staring with my jaw on the ground into the television as the credits rolled by thinking to my self that s it that s the ending what a piece of sh t if madonna wasn t a pop icon at the time of this film this movie would have single handedly destroyed her career and the funniest thing of the whole situation was that i just watched the damn movie to see where they placed the song who s that girl well guess where they placed it at the end,0
16622,head is one of those films you ll have a lot of trouble convincing your friends to see but once they do they ll fall in love with it i don t know how many times this has happened to me this film is just so funny and bizarre really a deconstruction of everything the monkees had been up to this point in their career a lot the credit goes to bob rafelson who pretty much ended the monkee s career with this film my guess is he wanted to get out of directing the tv show and get into features which he did in a big way after this one micky dolenz is absolutely hilarious i can t believe he didn t have a second life as a comic actor after this film this film has a lot of great cameos and a lot of wonderful psychedelic nonsense i feel like the reputation of this film is continuing to build and it wouldn t surprise me if it eventually becomes a full on cult classic,1
8006,i stumbled across this movie late at night on tv my brother and i could not stop laughing at how god awful this movie is the crappy sound effects whenever white ninja or black ninja punch kick or use a weapon is hilarious this movie is almost on the same level as the evil dead series but you can only watch this movie once because of shear crappiness i m not sure if the director meant for it to be so crappy on purpose because he knew idiots like me would buy it,0
14026,stephen hawkings is a genius he is the king of geniuses watching this movie makes me feel dumb but it s a great movie not highly entertaining but very very intriguing the movie centers around wheelchair bound stephen hawkings a man who makes einstein look average and his theories and scientific discoveries about the universe time the galaxy and black holes everyone at sometime or another during a really intense high comes to a moment when they think they v got the universe and the cosmos figured out and they swear as soon as they sober up they ll write it all down well here is a man who actually held that feeling for more then six hours here is a man who despite suffering from lou gehrig s disease has become the greatest mind the world has yet seen watch this and listen in on how he has formulated theories on black holes awesome you won t be the same after you see it,1
7996,boring cliched and predictable the only original bit was the brighton location for gangsters it is certainly no lock stock etc hannah was likeable in sliding doors in circus i developed no empathy with his character and couldn t give a toss what happened to either him or his girlfriend although this movie was so cliched and predictable the ending was no surprise i was so uninterested i didn t even care why the movie was given the name circus booooring don t visit this big top,0
17747,i watched this movie only because i didn t want to leave my 9 yo and her friend in the theater by themselves honestly i went in expecting to enjoy a good nap but found myself entranced by the movie i d recommend it to anyone who asks roy s mom was on one of my all time favorite tv shows years ago playing a mermaid maximum bob she was really cute in this movie the three main characters were all excellent young actors also enjoyed seeing and hearing jimmy buffet the movie itself was quite beautiful showcasing some of what makes florida so great i m glad i ended up going to this movie and to think i was disappointed that i couldn t take them to see stick it i think this was much better,1
17920,the late shift is a great book i read the book several years ago and i was transfixed at the cutthroat debauchery that went on when johnny carson retired and jay leno and johnny carson tried to grab his spot when the movie came out i snagged a vhs copy of the movie and having reread the book recently it s hard to say which i enjoy more because they re quite equal in the amount of information conveyed the two lead actors john michael higgins and daniel roebuck two actors i never heard of before and haven t heard of since play leno and letterman convincingly despite letterman s dismissal of his portrayal as being poor they play the parts quite well despite a lot of people looking for an imitation of the two i wasn t as interested in that the story is what counts and that brings me to kathy bates kathy bates playing helen kushnick is this movie she plays this evil bitch of a character so menacingly you realize how on earth can this woman control herself much less a national tv show yikes there should be a sequel,1
14869,this film is great being a fan of the comic strip presents i just knew i would love this film and love it i do i finally got round to buying a copy of this film early this year however i was annoyed to find that it had been cut so i ll keep looking at car boot sales for the original version anyway the film is about dennis carter adrian edmondson who tries to impress his girlfriend dawn french by claiming to be a drug dealer however dennis is overheard bragging one night in the pub and nicked so dennis turns supergrass but the trouble is he doesn t know anything and starts to make up lies and dig himself into an even deeper hole the irony of all this is that there is drug smuggling going on down in devon this film is not as funny as i expected but it is still a really good film with some good laughs and a great soundtrack it also has the best scene ever in a british film robbie coltrane s walk across the pier set to two tribes by frankie goes to hollywood so if you are a fan of the comic strip presents of any of the cast members or a fan of british comedy see it a s a p,1
391,the director spent a lot of time making the scenes look real right down to the historical photos and all the sounds of the old west bustle too bad the producers and writer director michael cimino spent zero time on any of the historical facts of what the johnson county war was really about a lot of the war was over how public lands should be used for grazing the cattlemen didn t want the poor sheep herders on the land to compete for forage on this cold windswept plateau the entire epic makes no mention of grazing sheep which was one of the most important reasons for the war the worst scene is the battle between the peasants and the hired killers the peasants are shown circling the gunmen like a bunch of indians would do in much earlier hollywood movies the true fact is that johnson county sheriff william red angus with a posse of 200 to 300 men intercepted the gunmen and trapped them in a barn at the ta ranch i doubt any women took part in the siege ellen ella also known as cattle kate watson and her second husband james averell were hanged by a lynch mob about three years before the johnson county invasion ella was never a prostitute this was a canard spread by the wyoming stock growers association wsga in order to discredit her the fact that the plot makes her out to be a brothel madam only serves the interests of the wsga i object to the use of names of real people in a plot that is so obviously fiction there is no fact in the events time lines or backgrounds of the characters why michael cimino would use real names of people who were loosely connected with the johnson county war and events leading up to it is beyond me the movie could have been much more interesting if it had dwelt on the political ramifications of the federal government intervention in a state government s affairs and what happened after the wsga gunmen were saved by the calvary some effort was made to prosecute the cattlemen who were responsible by the johnson county attorney but since johnson county could not afford the court costs and the governor of wyoming amos w barber backed the wsga the charges were eventually dropped overall i think the movie was just an excuse to show isabelle huppert naked for much of the three and 3 4 hours of running time on the dvd version,0
12829,after the success of the first two godfather films in 1972 and 1974 respectively francis ford coppola embarked on an ambitious attempt to bring home the reality of the war in vietnam which had concluded with the fall of saigon to the vietcong in 1975 the plot was loosely based on the book heart of darkness a story by joseph conrad about kurtz a trading company agent in the african jungle who has acquired mysterious powers over the natives coppola retains much of this including such details as the severed heads outside kurtz s headquarters and his final words the horror the horror in the film sheen plays an army captain given the mission to penetrate into cambodia and eliminate with extreme prejudice a decorated officer who has become an embarrassment to the authorities on his journey up the river to the renegade s camp he experiences the demoralization of the us forces high on dope or drunk with power although as a result of cuts forced on coppola the film was accused of incoherence when first released it was by the most serious attempt to get to grips with the experience of vietnam and a victorious reinvention of the war film genre in 1980 the film won an oscar for best cinematography and best sound apocalypse now was re released in 2001 with fifty minutes restored as a result the motion picture can now be seen as the epic masterpiece it is,1
728,tamara anderson and her family are moving once again as her itinerant painter father chases his next landscape fifteen years old she is in her rebellious stage already angry at her father for their frequent relocations her anger is exacerbated when her mother is suddenly confined to a sanatorium for tuberculosis her mother s absence causes tamara to lash out at her father and seek comfort in religion the boy next door rusty as well as the spirit of the dead teenager who used to live in her rented house the story is modest to a fault it s oddly paced and even during its emotional scenes there isn t any tension the actors portraying the parents are fine alberta watson is incredibly charismatic as the sick mother and maria ricossa is particularly effective as the guilt ridden mother of the dead teenager but katie boland as tamara is too amateurish to carry the movie the dialog is very natural and boland can t quite pull it off she has her moments and when she hits them she can be good but there were too many times when she came off awkward one can see her thinking ok this is what my line is and this is the face i m supposed to make rather than actually reacting to the other actors she s not the only one kevin zegers as rusty and megan park as his sister brenda also suffer from stilted delivery but at least they re in fewer scenes if done right the screenplay could have made her an affecting movie and it has it moments but much of it is bogged down with an amateurish lead performance and flat directing,0
5191,this is possibly the worst of the cockney gangster genre that has blighted the british film industry since mockney guy ritchie unleashed lock stock and two badly acted barrels this true life story of carlton leach who has everything that is wrong with this genre a truly awful script that consists of people screeching cant fahcking cant and i ll kill ya ya fahcking cant ad nauseum the acting is uniformly dreadful with the two most recognisable cast members being two former soap stars quite visably out of their depth for some reason the film assumes we have heard of these people and i can assure you anybody north of essex hasn t and that we should be interested in some low lifes story why this isn t goodfellas despite the blurb on the dvd cover the story centres around a football hooligan turned bouncer turned gangster who s friends end up getting shot boo hoo the fact that these people are totally unsympathetic is the only minor plus for this film in all of the action scenes it seems that the camera was tied to a piece of string and whirled around while people pretended to fight and the story of somebody most people have never heard of and nothing really interesting happens too is a complete waste of time people talk about how violent the film is as though it s the sign of a great film and although many great films have violence in them this is just an excuse for the fx man to show what he can do overall this film is a reminder of why the british film industry is defunct and the sooner we stop funding these pathetic abortions the better,0

3974,well i watched this film expecting to be rolling in the aisles how wrong i was the film was moderately amusing at best and irritating at worst the slapstick comedy styling of building an ark with archaic tools laugh no i didn t i m very disappointed given steve carrel was the lead i ve watch the office us religiously cracks me up immensely i thought 40 year old virgin was good but evan elp us why on earth did he accept this script and as for morgan freeman he s old enough to know better so the idea seemed reasonable the actors i had every faith in but the execution was nothing to write home about and the ending well it seemed as if they had run out of money or ideas this for me was one of the most contrived endings i could have imagined they took a biblical story and dumbed it down to a cautionary tale on localized environmental issues not even global issues but a local bill yawn in summary reasonable start got gradually worse and for me it was all washed out by the time the credit s rolled,0
3141,dakota incident has to be one of the strangest westerns i ve ever seen not good but definitely strange a driver less stagecoach rides into the town of christian flats with all passengers killed it s scheduled to go on but very few for obvious reasons want to risk the cheyennes on the warpath out there but linda darnell regis toomey john lund whit bissell and ward bond each have their reasons for going on and dale robertson who killed john doucette in a gunfight after doucette and skip homeier shot and left him for dead in the desert is so anxious to go he s willing to drive the team of course the cheyennes attack the intrepid group of passengers if forced into a dry wash for cover who will live and who will die is the remainder of the film dakota incident came at the very end of republic pictures before herbert j yates pulled the plug on his little studio westerns were their specialty but normally of the kind roy rogers made this would not have been a rogers product in fact it s beyond belief the characters aren t ground in any kind of reality whit bissell is taking back ore samples from his claim but robertson discovers it s iron pyrites fool s gold toomey is a guitar playing cynic who goes mad from thirst darnell is after a cheating manager of her s but really doesn t know what to do when she finds him lund is looking to bring in robertson who committed a crime he took the rap for but has to bring him in alive for that he d require help but doesn t have any but the worst is ward bond who s a united states senator on his own peace mission to the cheyennes in real life bond was a most right wing individual and i m not sure this wasn t some kind of a caricature of what he would perceive as a liberal he s really quite the fatuous fool but i think that might have attracted him to the role i tried to get into dakota incident but couldn t and the ending was a bizarre fantasy to say the least give it three stars for the cast involved,0
17579,michael is probably too cutesy for most action movie fans and too hollywood for the intellectual crowd but i found it both extremely funny and very touching despite it being both cutesy and formulaic when three skeptics are sent to investigate a man claiming to be an angel they end up escorting him on a grand tour of the mid western country side only to find that it is each of their own hearts that need investigation when taking this film apart as with most films today there isn t a lot of new material but when taken as a whole it has a refreshingly original approach and is off beat enough to entertain one all the way through while not being a family film it is suitable for all ages and a good film to share with the whole family or that special someone michael isn t a great film but it certainly is a good film a touching film and well worth seeing kwc,1
16895,when nathaniel kahn embarked into this voyage he hardly knew who his father really was by the end of the film he found him and comes to terms with the strange life he lived as a child louis kahn was the father he was an architect s architect his designs were perhaps too complex as he tried to create buildings that didn t conform with trends popular at that time it is ironic that he never achieved the fame that came so easy to some of his contemporaries he had a vision and he never strayed from it we can see characteristics of his unique style in the buildings he left behind as a legacy to humanity every one of his creations are unique in that they don t imitate works from other architects louis kahn s life was rather complicated he was married yet he had affairs with two of his assistants that produced a girl and a boy besides the legitimate daughter he had with his wife as a boy nathaniel kahn s life was lived in a secluded area away from his father who only visited late at night louis kahn never recognized these children although it is very clear they all knew about the others existence it is tragic that louis kahn died alone in grand central station when he was returning from a trip without making peace with the women and children he never acknowledged as his own by his side he probably cared a great deal about all his children but he remains an aloof figure throughout the film we never get to know the man although at the end nathaniel in his quest to discover his father s life finds most of the missing pieces of the puzzle this is a personal account on the life of an artist thanks to that son who has the courage to tell the story we are almost prying into the lives of louis kahn and his extended family,1
12515,water 2005 the final part of toronto based indian film director deepa mehta s elemental trilogy has been finally completed almost ten years after the release of the very first controversial element fire 1996 which was followed with a slightly lesser controversial sequel 1947 earth 1998 mehta made her directorial debut with a 24 minute canadian short film at 99 a portrait of louise tandy murch 1975 but it was her canadian feature film about the life of indians living in canada that brought her fame back in east her country by birthright sam me 1991 recognition internationally came in the way of camilla 1994 starring bridget fonda along with the actress who in 1990 won an oscar in best actress in a leading role category at the age of 80 paving the way for middle aged actresses to still have hope for her portrayal of a stubborn old jewish woman in driving miss daisy 1989 late jessica tandy camilla dealt with a friendship between two women from two other ends of the human lifespan a may december friendship camilla was tandy s last picture she died the very same year international fame followed deepa mehta in 1996 with the release of the controversial fire which spread with rage among the false patriotic consciousness existing indian extremist having already explored friendship between two women in camilla in fire mehta went a step further to portray a more intimate relationship between two lonely neglected women set in modern day india the suburbs of the capital city of new delhi it shows two brothers and their wives the elder brother kulbhushan kharbanda having joined a weird hindu sect leads a life of celibacy faithful to his guru of sexless existence the younger brother javed jaffrey is having an extra marital affair with a chinese woman alice poon thus both the wives shabana azmi playing the elder brothers wife and nandita das the younger wife find themselves neglected in their own way one forced to lead a celibate life thanks to her husband s eccentricities and the other whose only interaction with her husband is through sex and nothing more living in a world of in laws and being the only two outsiders in the family having nobody else to confide in the two women fall in the arms of each other thus comes the issue of lesbianism if there were an outside man s shoulder to cry on there most probably would have been chance for them to fall into the arms of a man but having no one else to confide in their need for each others support is quite obvious it does not necessarily state that all neglected women would end up taking lesbianism it just happened to exist with regard to the two women in this context all in all the movie is excellent and delves far deeper than just two women rolling in bed the key focus isn t lesbianism in the movie but the plight of modern day neglected indian wives even in the capital city the two female characters just happen to have a sexual relationship two years later deepa mehta s second installment was the element of mother earth released in india by the name of 1947 earth yet another excellent movie by a great director this time in the hindi language unlike fire which was made in the english language now deepa mehta has managed to complete the trilogy despite a lot of problems having released the final installment recently water no doubt it would be just as great as the other two,1
1256,ed gein the butcher of plainfield is set in the small american town of plainfield in wisconsin during 1957 where loner ed gein kane hodder lives by himself on a farm after the death if his mother brother the local police have had a spate of grave robberies to deal with when local barmaid sue layton ceia coley suspicions grow that something nasty is going on ed is a violent sexually deviant man who kidnaps girls murders them will the police figure the truth out in time to save erica adrienne frantz the sheriff s timothy oman daughter written produced directed by michael feifer this was an attempt to base a horror film around the true events surrounding notorious serial killer ed gein turns out to be pretty crap the real life ed gein was only ever convicted of two murders died in 1984 but several films have been inspired by him including the texas chainsaw massacre 1974 deranged 1974 ed gein 2000 with this fairly recent addition possibly being the worst gein film ever even though ed gein was real next to nothing in this film is based on fact gein never had an accomplice none of his victims were related to any of the investigating officers there was no car crash victim although gein keeps his name other people have had name changes the kidnapping murder of the two women depicted here actually happened four years apart in reality but in this film it happens over the course of a couple of days while here gein is shown as a large hulking muscular man in reality he was a scrawny thin old quite short as a factual drama ed gein the butcher of plainfield is worthless as pure entertainment it s no better with a deadly dull pace feel to it the character s are all boring when he isn t killing someone gein is shown working or just walking around it s very dull there s no suspense because we know who the killer is it s just a tedious wait until he gets caught at the end there is no real attempt to get into gein s mind with the makers giving him no more motivation than him occasionally having hallucinations of his domineering mother there isn t much gore here there s a scene with a woman hanging on a meat hook there s a really badly edited scene of gein cutting a leg off there s the usual jars of bodily organs skulls lying around as well as a bit of blood but there s really not much here to get excited about the film was obviously processed to bleach a lot of the colour out of the picture as it s not far off black and white at times i personally think the lack of colour makes it even duller to sit through with a supposed budget of about 1 500 000 i can t really see where the money went in a very forgettable production although set in wisconsin this was filmed in california kane hodder is all wrong for the role of ed gein just from a physical point of view hodder doesn t look even remotely like gein he gives a pretty poor performance to as he just stares at the camera a lot making silly faces ed gein the butcher of plainfield is crap it s as simple straightforward as that as either a factual drama or pure exploitation entertainment this is total tripe from start to finish with nothing to recommend it,0
6665,thankfully brief mystery about a telephone operator who is discovered to be the kidnapped daughter of a railroad tycoon the discovery brings about an attempt on her life which is foiled by charlie ruggles as a crime deflector things take a turn for the dangerous when everyone ends up in the title location and another attempt is made on the girls life your enjoyment of this film will depend upon your tolerance for rugggles and his nonsense i normally like ruggles but there was something about this role that rubbed me the wrong way actually i think it didn t help that the mystery wasn t very good so there was nothing beyond the characters to keep you watching yes the finale on the train was exciting but it didn t make up for everything that went before not worth searching out but if you stumble upon it give it a try,0
638,don wilson stars as jack cutter ooh real tough name a vampire slayer who goes up against a vampire army you see the story is a little different because vampires can t be killed with silver crosses or sunlight but rather through snapping their necks how convenient as it cuts down on the budget and it s here cutter runs into a reporter melanie smith of trancers iii fame night hunter s action sequences shake for no reason during the fight sequences and although it s meant to emphasize the mood it just makes the movie more jarring what is worse is that these fight sequences are botched beyond belief as wilson s martial artistry is disguised by disjointed editing of course the most interest comes from the fact that indeed this predates blade however the problem is that this was done on a small budget and that it had don wilson in it it s from roger corman and basically this turkey is a movie most people would pay not to see i unfortunately am a bottom feeder and i cater to the section of the store looking for gems in this line of work you always run into turds with night hunter i just may have the world s stinkiest turd 1 2 out of 4 awful,0
10248,i ve read the positive comments on this movie i assume people who were in this movie must ve come to this site to give it some good press because this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen i always watch the whole film despite the quality or lack there of which explains why i watched this whole movie but i don t think i laughed even once during the duration of this film the jokes were mostly very bad but when the jokes had some promise the delivery was off if you liked it maybe you should lay off the buds because you need to preserve the 5 or 6 brain cells you have left this movie had a poor script bad acting poor directing weak plot nothing of virtue and was not entertaining if you haven t seen this movie don t,0
22271,simply an amazing bittersweet movie that portrays a side of life often skipped over in feel good movies i saw this as a child and came back to it very recently and fell in love again as a child it sparked my interest purely for the building of a plane as an adult it captured me in the dark world and a young mans escape from that world the portrayal of the king was great the camera style chosen with low shots and shots focusing on actions and hand movements was i thought well done i personally can not recall anything quite done in that style and adds to the character and portrays him as a force almost not human which may not be far from reality it makes for interesting developments worth a watch any day,1
19553,wow just caught this movie from blockbuster and i love finding gems like this while it was definitely shot on a budget and misses a little bit in clumsy editing i e accident hospital scenes second to last end scenes for a first directorial effort i give this 10 stars i absolutely loved the thought provoking concepts brought forth and if you re a free thinker and open to ideas outside the box i highly highly recommend this movie i think the director and writer jay floyd should be given some attention and more opportunities in the film industry based on his credits he may be another quentin tarantino,1
18729,years before pre nuptial agreements became a regular thing ernest lubitsch made a screen comedy on which they are the basis bluebeard s eighth wife involves gary cooper as a multi millionaire living on the french riviera who s been married seven times and now marries claudette colbert for number eight but cooper s a good sport about it he always settles with his ex wives for a 50 000 00 a year as per an agreement they sign before marrying him sounds like what we now call a pre nuptial agreement of course claudette wants a lot more than that and she feels cooper takes an entirely too business like approach to marriage she d like the real deal and is willing to go some considerable lengths to get it bluebeard s eighth wife has some really funny moments the original meeting of cooper and colbert in a men s store where cooper is insisting he wants only pajama tops and colbert looking for only bottoms and of course my favorite is colbert trailing and blackmailing the detective cooper sends to spy on her herman bing has the best supporting role in the film as that selfsame flustered detective i ve often wondered how back in the day hollywood could get away with casting so many people who are non french in a film like this of course cooper is an american and colbert of the cast is the only one actually of french background though david niven is charming as always having him be a frenchman is ludicrous he is sooooooo british nevertheless bluebeard s eighth wife is an enjoyable film and a great example of what was called the lubitsch touch back in the day,1
3709,brief marital infidelity comes back to haunt loving wife grace needham portrayed by the always sexy nastassja kinski she had left town and her depressing husband to embark on a trip to sunny miami where she was pursued and ultimately seduced by julian grant a handsomely evil and manipulative business executive who is portrayed very well by william baldwin why do all of the baldwin brothers play evil people so damn well the seducing of grace took place as the two drank champagne on a deserted beach they reached privately by sailboat grace admitted she drank too much for her own good and revealed the many problems in her marriage julian gained her confidence by claiming he would never allow those types of problems to occur if he had a relationship with grace julian s manipulation continued as he described a lost at sea fantasy involving the now uninhibited grace who sat near listening to his every word and becoming more and more engaged with his romantic dream his manipulation paid off as a few subtle nudges led to grace s soft kisses paused momentarily by her pulling back as if suddenly thinking to herself what am i doing i m a wife i m a mother i have a real life real responsibilities sure the two of us have talked about being together lost at sea but that is just a fantasy look at what we re doing here the consequences are real we re really alone on a secluded beach am i going to let this fantasy really happen she succumbs to the dream as her kisses became more passionate the once guarded grace who used to respond to men s propositions by saying i m married enjoyed watching as julian unbuttoned her shirt leading to more kisses body caresses and her climbing onto julian s lap she smiles kisses moans laughs and frequently looks up at the sun throughout what unfortunately was a brief love making scene in which everybody seemed to have most of their clothes on while i thoroughly enjoyed the look of illicit passion on grace s face as the once devoted wife was being thoroughly satisfied by having sex with a man that clearly enjoys manipulating others i will say that on the whole the scene was undeserving of the movie s r rating julian returned home to find her husband rejuvenated from his securing of a high paying job and she is excited about being able to return to a normal life where she can once again be a loving wife and caring mother but the evil julian grant reenters the picture and is not willing to give up so easily on grace grace has a plan to rid her life of julian but will it work obviously i don t want to ruin the remaining story line for you however i will say that i always enjoy movies involving sexual pretense by a wife especially when she exhibits uninhibited attraction and behavior that is normally reserved for her husband but in actuality is seeking revenge against the antagonist this movie would have been much much better if the movie had included more of that in the story line my feelings are if the movie brings it up then the movie should finish it and this movie definitely brought it up unfortunately certain constraints in the story line prevented this from being significantly pursued there are many other movies available that succeed with that very point and i ll include their titles in the recommendations portion of this section i m also open to receiving emailed suggestions of other movies that contain a good story line involving sexual pretense on the part of a seemingly devoted wife overall nastassja kinski and william baldwin are both very good the movie is not,0
15595,this is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theaters i came across it while switching tv channels and was immediately engrossed in this story of an aging rodeo bum whose recklessness and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him i ve often wanted to see the movie again but couldn t even remember its name and have never seen it in the rental stores james coburn and slim pickens were excellent in their roles and the rodeo footage was first rate while being an action movie and having a western setting and theme it could be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their taste in films,1
9692,this representation of the popular children s story on film is pretty pathetic to watch i know it is one of the earliest efforts at moviemaking but this 15 minute picture is unimaginative and poorly shot the great train robbery 1903 which i also commented on is much more creative and exciting to watch we see little long haired jack trade a cow 2 men in a cow suit for a hatful of beans from a merchant and later a beanstalk grows from where his mom throws them in the yard i guess poor jack attained the wrong kind jack dreams of a goose actually it seems to be a chicken and golden egg and the next day climbs the stalk into heaven there is no effort made to be creative in this film the stalk looks like a rope with leaves on it the giant is just a tall bearded guy in a home with nothing abnormally large in comparison to jack and the climax to the film where jack makes his escape with the goose chicken and its golden egg is miserable as a stuffed dummy falls from out of screenshot in place of the giant and then the actor takes its place rising up on his feet in a exaggerated death dance like in most early films the beanstalk leaf covered rope comes trailing down from above and coils neatly on the giants forehead watch something else,0
14895,seriously engaging intelligent and thought provoking drama at its very best mean gripping moody and captivating every home should have a copy don t take my word for it see it yourself one life stand makes you consider your own lifestyle and how you treat your family and friends beautiful photography and impressive acting makes for one of the best cinema graphic experiences of the year john kielty s debut is a delight and adds a real touch of truth and realism to this deep and gritty film this is a film that cares and has an honesty that is unequalled in recent years no car chases but a film packed with hum our and emotion i first saw this film screened at the edinburgh film festival in 2000 and am now delighted to be able to own a copy on dvd,1
22549,great historical movie will not allow a viewer to leave once you begin to watch view is presented differently than displayed by most school books on this subject my only fault for this movie is it was photographed in black and white wished it had been in color wow,1
17508,peter o toole one of our finest actors is magnificent as a reserved school master who is dedicated to teaching young boys he meets a show girl and falls in love the story is one of love and devotion petula clark adds spirit and sensitivity not too mention a remarkable voice you will enjoy this film even though the ending might not be a happy one i enjoyed it,1
3242,this is easily the worst most offensive piece of crap on tv i d love to completely ignore it but fox has stuck it into their sunday lineup forcing me to find something else to watch between american dad and family guy the dink head male star guy is just about the least evolved pathetic excuse for a human i have ever seen on tv nothing on the show is remotely funny and pretty much everything on it has been done already and much better by other shows it s obvious that their strategy is to ram it deep and hard into the sunday schedule and hope someone starts liking it but i have to break it to ya fox thats the wrong hole the scam not worked on me i simply look elsewhere but come on you freaking boneheads this show freaking sucks and it sucks even worse when compared to the rest of the fox sunday lineup they cancelled arrested development for this steaming pile,0
23405,at a time when hollywood thinks that louder faster and bloodier are better manna from heaven is comedic and touching look at something we ve all thought about what would i do if a load of money fell from the sky interestingly it took the characters many years to realize that the money hadn t made a single difference in their lives they all become what they were destined to be unfortunately in most cases what they became was unhappy in spite of their good fortune all those years ago while manna offers the familiar hollywood storyline of good vs evil or in the case generosity vs greed what sets this film apart is that good wins out by converting evil not by crushing it i think the important message of this film is that you can change the world even if you do it one person at a time,1
21212,a lot of my childhood was spent lying in front of the wireless listening to round the horne or hancock s half hour or watching carry on films probably the most famous line in comedy infamy infamy they ve all got it infamy still makes me laugh this is a rare insight into the man behind the comic figure and the whole production is a brilliant mix of tragedy and comedy right down to the final quotation from the coroner s court read in four different voices by michael sheen he was brilliant in the role most of the other members of the carry on team were so so and their kenneth horne was very good but michael sheen carried the show and there should be an award of some sort for him it left me feeling wow to quote kenneth williams to the cynic who says life is a joke the only response can be yes well let s make it a good one,1
6863,very shortly a bad film if you are looking for pure action and no brain or brain illusion or you are under 15 years old and like bruce willis this is the movie also don t expect the scenario to be consistent or even believeable if you think a little so don t if you just want to enjoy yourself,0
5348,i m a big fan of kevin spacey s work but this is a sub standard film if you think it looks interesting or you saw it and liked it go and check out john boorman s the general it is basically about the same guy but is far superior in every way and doesn t suffer from the hollywood glorifications,0
24209,sharky s machine is clearly a burt reynolds vehicle designed to allow the star room to strut his talents and he spray paints the machine the film plot with colors from other films and other styles offering a variety of moods within a nourish story made in 1981 at 119 minutes lengthy for the time period the film did well with box office grosses at 37 800 000 it had a lot going for it burt reynolds actor and director a solid one two punch a william diel novel adaptation and the south land of atlanta georgia at this time a land of opportunity for film production out of hollywood reynolds tom sharky falling in love with rachel ward s dominoe the hooker with a heart of gold is here echoed as it was in hustle when he played opposite catherine deneuve and that film also had a corrupt politician at its core but with downbeat ending not the hollywood happiness in sharky s machine the story is pure detective procedure actioner sharky a narcotics detective mismanages up a bust of a drug dealer causing the killing of some innocent bystanders and gets demoted literally transferred downstairs to vice to deal with perverts and other m misdemeanors that upstanding cops consider latrine duty his new digs offers him the chance to meet many equally upstanding officers who are doing the dirty jobs no one else wants when some attention is pointed toward a certain pimp sharky looks over some evidence and discovers that one particular prostitute dominoe rachel ward dominoe is being shielded by police forces and political forces and sharky sets himself up a 24 hour surveillance force to watch her during the time he watches he learns that the current governor elect hotchkins earl holliman is visiting dominoe as is a slick italian gangster victor vittorio gassman before the police can build a case with the evidence billy victor s brother a coke snorting gunman henry silva shoots through the door of dominoe s apartment seemingly killing the beautiful dominoe but when sharky discovers that the murdered victim was actually a roommate tiffany aarika wells sharky confronts victor and tells him that he is going to have him arrested sharky is captured by some ninja killers lead by smiley darryl hickman and is tortured for information to lead to dominoe but sharky overpowers them and arrests the governor and in a heated chase kills billy after he has killed victor reynolds wants to exhibit the inner workings of a hardened policemen falling in love but the police story plot flavored with noir element and reynolds ability at cinematic development tends to slick over the dynamics of the relationships we come to learn something about some of the men and this leads us to reason why they are working towards their pensions in vice instead of fighting real crime this element of the film seems sketchy under reynolds off handed direction and performance there is always uniqueness to a reynolds film he likes to hire stars either character actors or others and then allow them to improvise sometimes with varying results with his crew in sharky s machine he gets some fine moments and sometimes some overblown grandstanding but always a sense of ensemble and good natured ness with reynolds as auteur it works reynolds the actor auteur always seems to be smirking at himself and the viewer as if to say it s all fake but good fun great line in the scene with victor when sharky throws down the gauntlet you re walkin all over people like you own em and you wanna know the worst part you re from out of state this seems to be the greatest insult the officer can throw at a criminal reynolds made the film in atlanta at his career point have shot himself reading the phone book and would have surely targeted and demographic the film did mark the appearance of rachel ward who was nominated as new star of the year in 1981 by the golden globe reynolds has always had presence and star power and has chosen to make films close to home georgia i got my dvd from half com for 7 99 and unfortunately it doesn t contain any commentary or making of features which is a shame maybe the next generation will have them the movie is still a lot of fun and both reynolds and ward are great looking actors in their prime,1
14843,i ve been writing hardboiled crime fiction for a number of years now when a writer develops a story he always has a character actor in mind to bring the story to life last weekend i found a new one in paul vario playing uncle benny in eddie monroe this was a slick film highlighted by vario s presence both on and off the screen as his voice over narration is also heard i also especially liked the actress playing benny s niece and eddie s ex wife although everyone did a fine job in this exciting movie about playing with bad guys and the double crossing that goes with it a nice job all around and mr vario shined brightest he s gotta be my tony gangi someday,1
22256,i really enjoyed random hearts it was shocking to see such a low rating on imdb but chacun a son gout and all that i am a big fan of harrison ford but i do have to admit that he was ill cast in this movie and the reason i gave it 9 instead of 10 kristin scott thomas though was just wonderful she was believable and beautiful in spite of being made up for half the movie like she d been crying for days could random hearts have been better sure but it is very much worth seeing as it is,1
7667,this movie is a real low budget production yet i will not say anything more on that as it already has been covered i give this movie a low rating for the story alone but i met the director the night i saw the film and he gave me an additional reason to dislike the movie he asked me how i enjoyed it and i told him that it was not easy to like my main objection was the lack of foundation for the relationship between the two main characters i was never convinced that they were close i also told him that the scene where the main characters were presented as children becoming friends was too late in the film he told me that the flashback scenes were not in the original script that they were added because he felt like i did that the two main characters did not appear close he went on to explain that these scenes were not filmed to his satisfaction as they were out of money i agree that they did not do much for the film another fact about the movie that i was not aware of is the actor who had the lead wrote the script based on his own personal experience this is usually a bad move as some writers do not take into consideration the emotional reaction the viewer the story is so close to home that the writer make too many assumption as to the audience s reaction to his own tragedy and the story is tragic however it did not work for me as i never cared for any of the characters least of all the lead what was presented were two evil people out to make a buck by any means regardless who gets hurt when ms young s character decides to give up he evil ways it appears that she does so because she is ineffective not because she knows she is doing wrong if the movie has a message then i suspect that only the writer is aware of it,0
14974,another decent offering from the pen of vince gilligan a pre malcolm in the middle bryan cranston plays patrick crump a deranged guy who eventually hijacks mulder via gunpoint and has him driving west at high speeds it has something to do with his severe head ringing possible deadly combustion his wife just experienced it and the pressure only seems to be relieved by heading towards the left coast only mulder could relate to this guy s plight and actually bond with his captor before the all night ride is completed meanwhile scully seems to have solved the case with a possible remedy for mr crump and will meet them at the ocean check it out to see if our dynamic duo can hook up at the pacific and somehow rectify mr crump s big problem,1
19985,it resembles so much to movies like pulp fiction or reservoir dogs that is impossible to think that tarantino s films weren t a source of inspiration to this thursday however for a low cost b series movie it s not bad the plot about gangsters is captivating and funny and it also has a bit of dark humor and sarcasm we can find in pulp fiction the resources weren t many fore sure but the film is well produced the acting also is good i enjoyed the scene when the girl was sat on the sofa teasing the doctor it was hot and funny at the same time the soundtrack is nice too i didn t hear too many songs but the ones i heard i liked i score it 7 10,1
775,i ve seen a lot of bad movies in my life date movie that was bad but this this is just it s not good house party 4 is the worst movie ever it s as simple as that it s basically ferris bueller with black people in it oh and it s not funny it s awful so awful chris stokes may be a superstar on bet but he s an idiot he can t write a comedy or a horror movie i like to refer to him as a blacker lesser known uwe boll except uwe boll s films are funny awful if you know what i mean you can invite some buddies over pop in alone in the dark and have a great time laughing and eating snacks with your buddies chris stokes is like that except if you invite friends over to watch house party 4 with you no one will be laughing not even the biased token black guy or the illiterate jock i m serious i didn t laugh once throughout this whole movie the acting is terrible and the movie looks like a bad indie film what was the budget for this movie 5 damn dollars i mean what the hell this movie just sucks don t waste your time with this crap it s disgusting,0
11621,this movie purports to show a middle class family s attempt to figure out what is going down in the america of the late 1960 s their trip to a rock festival is as far as their refurbished old bus gets without exception the characters are superficial stereotypes if you want to know which well established hollywood actors were desperate for a paycheck in those days just look at the credits sal mineo i had forgotten just how badly his career had hit the skids thank god his career rebounded before his untimely death the writers on this television turkey were clueless outside of doing weed their insights into the hippie movement were laughable,0
21020,so dark the night poses a tough challenge it s very hard to write about it in any detail without ruining it for those who haven t yet seen it since it remains quite obscure that includes just about everybody the movie will strike those familiar with its director joseph h lewis better known titles in the noir cycle gun crazy the big combo even my name is julia ross which in its brevity it resembles as an odd choice for starters the bucolic french countryside serves as its setting steven geray a middle aged detective with the sur t in paris sets out for a vacation in the village of ste margot or maybe margaux quite unexpectedly he finds himself falling in love with the inkeepers daughter micheline cheirel even though she s betrothed to a rough hewn local farmer but the siren song of life in paris is hard to resist so she agrees to marry him despite the disparity in their ages which inevitably becomes the talk of the town but on the night of their engagement party she fails to return to the inn soon a hunchback finds her body by the river her jealous jilted lover is the logical suspect but he too is found dead then anonymous notes threaten more deaths which come to pass for the first time in his career the bereaved geray finds himself stumped a particularly weak script all but does the movie in it plays like bad cornell woolrich crossed with the murder of roger ackroyd but lewis does this creaky vehicle proud he takes his time near the beginning but then the story and the storytelling gain momentum alas just about the time the script breaks an axle burnett guffey lighted and photographed the film with an intriguing leitmotif of peering out of and peeping into windows there s also an effective score by hugo friedhofer who supplied aural menace to many noirs a good deal of talent has been lavished on so dark the night but at the end it boils down to not much more than a gimmick and not a very good gimmick at that it s a one trick pony of a movie,1
8053,it s new year s eve a cop killer in the form of laurence fishburne end up at a precinct that s closing down due till snow when the people are layed siege on cops have to team up with cons to survive this re make of the john carpenter classic just had to add a few beyond stupid plot twists take out all the tension and add a horrid john lequizamo to the cast didn t it the first film was thrilling gritty and a joy to watch this one is more hollywood clich d and painful to behold the only thing i took from this movie was ocd can be very annoying very the ending song is sooooooooooooooooo bad my grade d dvd extras commentary by richet demonaco and jeffrey silver delet scenes with optional commentary 5 minute armed and dangerous featurette on the weapons expert 7 and a half minute behind precinct walls plan of attack the assault team 12 and a half minute behind the scenes featurette trailers for unleashed white noise seed of chucky miscelanious i got this at best buy and it came with a bonus disc including the first 2 minutes of cry wolf a 10 minute first look at unleashed the trailer for that film and a fuzion interview with john leguizamo,0
3086,this is one of those star filled over the top comedies that could a be hysterical or b wish that you had gone to the dentist to have all your teeth pulled instead unfortunately one night at mccool s is a classic b goldie hawn recently commented about town and country that it s a big problem in hollywood that they start with hiring the actors and putting together a deal before a script is completed you have to figure that not only did they go into this picture without a complete script they also mangled it daily maybe we need to send cards and letters to the heads of all the studio that say it s the script stupid this is also one of those movies where you find yourself feeling sorry for the actors most of the way through they re working their asses off trying to make all this seem hysterical but they know most of it is going to be accompanied not by belly laughs but by the sounds of the crickets you can hear inside the silent theatre is it an unmitigated disaster not entirely there are some smiles along the way mostly due to the efforts of the actors i probably would have gone out of the theatre thinking eh it was okay so why the undeniably hostile tone in my review the ending if as it s been noted the rest of the movie is just all a setup for the ending then it misses spectacularly i really wish i could speak specifically about it but i hate people who give too much away even in warning suffice it to say that as soon as you see john goodman behind a bent over paul reiser nothing given away here it s in the trailer get the hell out of the theatre and go out thinking eh it was okay the rest of the movie is tacked on and creatively bankrupt and you ll be appalled that there will actually be people laughing at this mess if you loved there s something about mary or meet the parents both great movies then don t bother to see this movie go have those teeth taken care of instead,0
7241,riggs and murtough are back but the magic of the first film has disintegrated the story line is just awful i mean really south african diplomats smuggling the mythical krugerrands into the u s it s just painful and the accents are absolutely abysmal can no one get an afrikaans south african accent right or will we forever hear the british or americans making them sound like drunken hollanders the only guy who got the afrikaans accent right was tim robbins in catch a fire another thing about this movie that i disliked was when danny glover so artlessly describes an afrikaans accent as being shitty i mean what a slap in the face to the afrikaans there s also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit i mean mel gibson s character is like so against the diplomats but then sleeps with their p a type don t waste your time watching this rubbish non researched film if you want to see a film that doesn t completely insult a cultural group then rent die hard 2,0
11964,i cannot believe i let myself rent that piece of garbage the acting was so poor my grandmother could have done better the punches thrown in the movies were nowhere near the character the scarecrow was knocking to the floor the movie became a chore to watch so this group of baseball jocks decide to go hazing even after they weren t supposed to in orders form there coach under consequences so naturally they go anyway they decide to tie a loser to a post with the so called scarecrow when the loser s best friend finds out about this him and his girlfriend go to rescue him the kid is found out to have diabetes and is hospitalized while the jocks head out to the beach the next day the scarecrow finds them there and kills them all pretty much i m sure you really don t care anyway the scarecrow ends up having a connection with diabetes boy and the boy starts to finish off the scarecrows job once the scarecrow is killed yes it is really really cheesy it thought this movie was full of bull sh t sooner or later the only ones living naturally are the boyfriend and girlfriend who are the main characters the evil is then transfered to the boyfriend and he kills himself to break the curse so nobody else will be hurt touching hey no don t waste your hard earned money on this i give it a score of a one since thats lowest otherwise it doesn t even deserve that much,0
13533,in a very near future world a corrupt government monitors everyone constantly with computers and surveillance one man has managed to evade assimilation and operates outside the system fighting to preserve his freedom an engaging and imaginative story and some very interesting editing and camera work there are some confusing and slow parts but all in all an excellent example of what a small crew with brains and talent can do on a shoestring budget,1
19611,the reason i think this movie is fabulous is that it has so many layers of emotion from the script and the fabulous acting you can tell that there is a history behind all of the feelings that there are you understand why the characters take certain actions and why the do not make others you can feel sympathy and joy and love and sorrow for them all at once you see humanity at its best and at it s worst you can relate to the characters because although you may have never been in their exact situations before you see qualities and downfalls in them that you see in yourself to a certain extent this movie kind of keeps you wondering but then at the end it explains itself and you feel a certain peace and understanding not only in you but for the characters i will say that i have have never ever cried so much in my life nor have gotten so much out of something i implore you to watch this movie and take it s meaning to heart that there is only one true thing and that is love,1
5585,say what you will about cinema s wizard of gore herschell gordon lewis it must be conceded that from his first films 1963 s trashy blood feast and 1964 s crackerbarrel massacre two thousand maniacs to his last 1972 s the gore gore girls the man remained faithful to his muse gleefully chopping up the bodies of young men and women for the delectation of the camera in gore gore for example someone has been mutilating the pasty faced and pasty clad strippers at the tops bottoms club and obnoxious ex detective gentry is hired by a hotty cub reporter to assist on the case the film features remarkably annoying and repetitive background music terrible lighting abysmal acting repugnant characters problematic sound and of course some of lewis patented gross out scenes thus one of the strippers has her face shoved into boiling oil one has her head ripped open another has her face ironed and her nippies cut off and still another has her bum paddled with a meat tenderizer until her entire backside is covered with what appears to be buitoni tomato sauce i could be wrong here it might have been ragu the film also throws out some fairly lame humor although some of the lines are pretty funny for example we learn that the real name of slain stripper suzie creampuff was ethel creampuff a bottle of acid says made in poland on it don t know why but i thought this was funny and some of strip club owner henny youngman s lines are of course amusing still this is not the movie to show to aunt ethel or sister agatha it is one of the sickest you ll ever see with only one surefire crowd pleasing moment the title card at the film s conclusion that reads we announce with pride this movie is over,0
11363,the only reason i didn t fall asleep during this movie is because the seats were not that comfortable hannibal is boring boring boring and boring this film is just dreadful not because of any violence or graphic mutilations it s actually quite tame in that regard the story moves at the speed of a lazy snail i have the feeling that director ridley scott just phoned this one in the actors are all fine they just needed some direction the music score is also very annoying it s especially noticeable since so little is going on in the film it does look good but that s not enough reason to see it by the way did i mention that it s boring,0
4268,i rented this movie because i am a huge dudikoff fan i figured it couldn t be that bad boy was i wrong at the 15 minute mark i was begiing the others to let me rip the dvd out and fling it back to the rental store but they refused they swore it had to get better they were wrong this movie was lacking everything the actors delivered their lines with as much emotion as a comatose rock the plot was ridiculous and i was offended that hollywood assumed people were dumb enough to enjoy it none of the characters interacted very well with each other ice t gives one of his worst performances here after watching footage of the wrong plane bad guys standing up to get shot and clips being emptied and missing everything i wanted to scream and bang my head on concrete the movie hit its plateau of ignorance when the people on the space station used an elevator to travel space suits are not needed and there is gravity in space regardless of what real astronauts may say i didn t finish this movie and hated it i don t want to finish this movie this is slow suicide i could feel my cerebral cortex planning to avenge the torture i put it through,0
18747,i came out of dark blue world feeling sigh so sad yet it was definitely a film needed to be made and it s truly well done from czech republic it s entertaining in spite of the sad premise it is full of feelings the bonding and undeniably true friendship between the two lead characters one mature lieutenant pilot ondrej vetch as franta and the young ever so eager budding pilot krystof h dek as karel the inevitable love triangle and the now and then reminders of the grim prison situations in czechoslovakia in the 50s it s all in one film put together by the father screenwriter and son director team zdenek and jan sver k previous achievement being the lovable kolya it s not as long as east west french est ouest 1999 which was heart wrenching multi layered story about a returning russian doctor and french wife s ill fates after wwii in russia the plot of tmavomodr svet title in czech is quite straightforward and has sprinkles of light humor music songs of wwii england sung in czech modest special effects of pilots and air crafts in the sky not elaborate like hollywood there s no need to be bing bang boom all the time when showing air battle scenes the sadness was explained up front in the beginning two paragraphs in english and wrap up with follow up paragraphs the film is not totally subtitled only when translating the czech conversations the rest are in english be it very british or in czech accents so it s a foreign film with english language and includes british actors the three lead performances especially of the two czech pilots were wonderfully delivered there are nuances between the two of them even though it s the steadily mature vs the eagerly young i always appreciate tara fitzgerald yes there s brassed off 1996 opposite ewan mcgregor and pete postlethwaite remembered her from hear my song 1991 opposite adrian dunbar and ned beatty opposite hugh grant in sirens 1994 and the englishman who went up a hill and came down a mountain 1995 besides her appearances in pbs masterpiece theatre mini series so sad the fact that heroes defending one s country can be so ill fatedly treated and for so long 40 years thank goodness for worthwhile memories and the imprints of friendship unforgettable hence the pause for a ray of sunshine through a stain glass window ironic or coincidental that it s of a church where the hard labor took place symbolic of hope never give up other recent films that have stories needed to be told kandahar with nelofer pazira as nafas the canadian from afghanistan taking a journey to kandahar with a personal mission in mind more than meets the eye behind a burqa by iranian director mohsen makhmalbaf everything put together with radha mitchell as a new mother facing sid sudden infant death insightful film by swiss director marc forster and his much talked about controversial film monster s ball i ve yet to catch with halle berry billy bob thornton and peter boyle see the films without prior expectations or comparisons to films before just see it,1
15037,i had never heard of this film and only got it because i am a martin sheen fan now i am stunned as to why it did not receive the praise and recognition that it truly deserves the four characters all make you feel for them the father trying to assert his authority the mother still clinging to traditional family values and both trying to keep up appearances despite the total fragmentation of their family the daughter wanting her own life and the son haunted by his experiences in vietnam one felt that this was a scenario that must have been played out in thousands of ordinary families after vietnam emilio estevez as jeremy was superb totally unhinged by his war experience which none of his family could relate to the screen chemistry between him and his real life father martin sheen was amazing and there were times when emilio s anguished face was so like martin s in apocalypse now i feel sure that just as martin has counted apocalype as one of his best films emilio will count this one as one of his best too the scene with the gun was totally mind blowing as all the emotions were there on the family s faces brilliant acting by estevez sheen and kathy bates i watched the film for the first time last night and today the lead story in the news was about a gulf war veteran who had shot several members of his family how many more young men are going to have their lives destroyed by war,1
18269,while watching a mundane modern movie the runaway bride with my granddaughter age 22 she asked me since you ve been watching movies since 1938 what is the greatest movie of your lifetime boy what a choice that is it took me all summer of thought and relooking a some flicks before i made my decision it is the best years of our lives this movie has no flaws it is one movie in which each one of the minor characters part and dialog is essential to the whole story there is not a single part in the film which could be left out the young girl s fixation with her brothers lack of hands the man coming home to young adult children who have grown up without him and with different ideas the portrayal of a young man whose only responsiblity was as a soda jerk who became the leader of a group of men and was awarded medals for his action a women who must now adjust to the husband who s life has been away from her for years the realization of the folks who were in the safety of there secure homes of the sacrifices these ordinary men made in their behalf the look into the life of loving and living with a man without hands a parents first look and reaction to their son s new deformities a man used to making life and death decision in a instant having to return to the way of plodding though a conservative bank s loan structure this is no sympathetic tear jerking heart strumming act this was real life it could not have been portrayed any different this my friends is how it was this could easily be considered a documentary in this day of color film please do not be turned off by the black and white because it is one of the finest b w filming editing and directing you will ever see the casting was perfect if i could i would make it compulsory for anyone taking history film making creative writing sociology family counciling or psychology to view and report on this magnificent example of the film makers art,1
16658,enhanced by the expressive cinematography of agnes godard beau travail golden door is a visually striking tone poem that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in sicily to ellis island in new york at the turn of the century it is a surreal enigmatic often strange but ultimately deeply rewarding experience interweaving dreamlike and symbolic imagery with gritty realism the latest film by emanuele crialese respiro is like an impressionistic painting a cinematic artist s rendering of what the immigration process may have been like for our parents and grandparents crialese s magical mystery tour came about as a result of his visit to the museum on ellis island the looks on the faces of the immigrants depicted in photographs he saw and his research into the harsh policies and procedures used during the admission of immigrants guided by letters he read of immigrants sent to relatives who remained at home crialese identifies with those impoverished immigrants who were able to see the positive side of things beyond their ordeal to salvatore mancuso vincenzo amato and his older son angelo francesco casisa america is a distant dream that they know nothing about after climbing a rocky mountain to pray to the saints for a sign they are rewarded when they are shown post cards by salvatore s younger son pietro filippo pucillo a deaf mute that depict the new world as a land where they can bathe in rivers of milk sit under a money tree or harvest giant onions and carrots after disposing of their animals in exchange for shoes and suits salvatore his two sons and his elderly mother fortunata aurora quattrocchi set out on their adventure with more hope than trepidation but the equation soon shifts the other way as they board the boat and settle into their crowded third class steerage compartments the most talked about scene in the film takes place using an overhead camera that shows masses of people standing as the ship pulls away the frame is divided into those aboard the ship and those waving goodbye from the dock and the way they are separated implies they are being torn asunder from everything familiar aboard the ship is a mysterious english woman named lucy charlotte gainsbourg crialese does not reveal her past or the reason she is traveling to america but she seems to stand for the onset of the modern world they are entering though they eye each other cautiously lucy becomes interested in salvatore and asks him to marry her in order to allow her to enter the country the voyage is treacherous with a violent storm buffeting the ship shot in almost complete darkness passengers in steerage are tossed against the side of the boat and afterward bodies lie tangled and twisted on the floor as if in a macabre totentanz the rite of passage through immigration processing at ellis island does not become any easier and crialese attacks the way illiterate peasants in the name of preserving civilized society are forced to put puzzles together perform mathematical tasks and undergo humiliating medical examinations to prove they are fit a marriage brokering ceremony feels like an auction block and the young women look despondent when they are matched with overweight middle aged men this is the only way they can enter the golden door however since single women are rejected unless they have partners ostensibly to prevent the threat of prostitution through the fog the immigrant s can barely see the land of milk and honey and there is no statue of liberty asking for the tired and the poor the humbled masses yearning to breathe free in their imagination however the river is still flowing waiting for them to jump in though the ending is ambiguous and one door opens on to a blank wall another door symbolizes a rebirth of the soul and the passage we must all take from the old world to the new,1
20249,i love this movie despite the fact it just misses being great it s an adult entertainment full of issues that a grown person can relate to the acting is superb it s fun watching john cassavetes and gena rowlands as a feuding middle aged couple who knows how much of it came from their own marriage susan sarandon has never been sexier or more appealing than as her freewheeling character aretha raul julia is a hoot as a lusty goatherd the scenery in greece is spectacular the new york settings cause me to squirm due to many shots of the world trade center fantastic score by stomu yamashta with so many things going for it why isn t this a great film it s a bit rambling and overly long unfocused and uncomfortably imbalanced between humor and drama still it s engaging entertaining and deeply thoughtful,1
13497,in my analysis of trois couleurs blanc i wrote that its tone is much lighter than the tone of trois couleurs bleu i think it s the same with this film this time it s not because of a tragic comedy element but much more because of the main character valentine although her boyfriend is living abroad and is ridiculously jealous she manages her life with lightness and optimism it seems to me that she might be kieslowski s image for a carefree youth the opposite seems to be the judge who is very pessimistic a grumpy old man who experiences big loneliness in my view valentine and the judge are pretty similar to each other the judge is just much older and has experienced many more disappointments they share a different kind of naivety and they both discover that they can learn much from the other one finally i would like to stress ir ne jacob s performance she rounds off the run of amazing female contributions to the three colours trilogy,1
12348,gotta add a comment to this one first ironically one needs to add the spolier alert to conform to imdb s parameters but there is absolutely nothing here to be spoiled there are six characters the good looking gal whose the a list mountain guide in the area of the climb and apparently among all guides including mt everest sherpas on the planet her lost love who disappeared from the titled pass two years prior whom the party is purportedly seeking but never find her store owner friend also a guide who may be better than a sherpa but no match for her the weird lead actor who engages her services and says they ll find her long missing love in the bargain his one associate a computer hacker with purportedly limitless expertise of a level sufficient that gates might seek advice from him and his other colleague a bodyguard who apparently has an iq not even near three digits there are of course nefarious goings on and the secret quest of the lead actor is to gain recovery of a satellite which has fallen in the pass and has world altering and unique data to bring them untold riches exactly what is never revealed overacting abounds the script looks like something which might get a c in a freshman writing class but an f if submitted at a higher level and the thespians gnaw every piece of scenery like a horde of beavers the most interesting aspects of this movie for me was juxtaposing portions with three other flicks or roles i ve seen first the mysterious undisclosed secret data makes one recall the spanish prisoner an a list mamet film surrounding a valuable corporate process never specifically clarified but better for it definitely not so here second the lead biscuit proved perhaps even more resourceful then rambo in dealing quickly when menaced later in the presentation third i remember a steven seagal flick don t recall the title where he was semi conscious and abed for about 1 3 of the time and fully comatose for another 1 3 although i ve not sought viewing a lot of his work i ve seen enough to have noted that while comatose he provided the best work he ever has and most in line with his laconic persona in this opus while awake the young hacker may have been the most engaging personality on screen but while indisposed and incapacitated during the latter portion and unable to emote he provided the best acting during this seemingly unending two hours take the thin silly basis for a plot here imagine it being compressed into say a lbit on snl with gilda radner bill murray dan aykroyd and martin short in the four roles they could get record laughs with few changes to the dialog here the most interesting aspect in the last analysis is contemplating what information could have been in the spy satellite to be worth even billions to any of many nations and yet rendered worthless according to the guru hacker if simply placed upon the internet with no apparent consequences thereafter even a turkey like this one should have at least a small trace of logic somewhere this one is totally devoid,0
5791,this film is little more than an ersatz verhoeven the filming is supposed to be tele realistic but is simply sickening the parody disappears after about 15 minutes to be replaced by a story which seems to take itself seriously the brechtian pauses for non existent advert brakes are tedious and even painful undoubtedly there was no actual intention to render this film brechtian it was just an accident which happened like that if you want to see a parody of reality tv watch celebrity deathmatch it s funnier and wittier and most importantly shorter i have rarely felt so much pain whilst watching a film to be avoided like a rabid rabbit,0
7860,this film is about two female killers going on a tour to kill random men they meet wow baise moi just became the worst film of all time in my list the plot is crazy pointless and unnecessary the whole film is full of violence and sex and i am sure no sane parents would want to show this film to their children i don t understand what people get out of by making this film or watching this film maybe someone somewhere has their perverted desires fulfilled there is simply no excuse or reasons for the existence of this perverted and depraved piece of work the only consolation i offer myself is that i watched it on fast forward so that i have not wasted as much time,0
6616,while star trek the motion picture was mostly boring star trek the final frontier is plain bad in this terrible sequel the crew is on shore leave when they get a distress signal from the federation that ambassadors representing earth romulus and kronos the klingon home world have been kidnapped by a renegade vulcan bent on his quest to attain a starship to venture into the great barrier there he hopes to find god using mysticism and bad writing he persuades many of the senior officers of the enterprise to betray kirk and get a hold of the ship they do reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they do meet a god like alien this one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin at the core is a good idea that is never really developed the plot goes nowhere instead of where no man has gone before it is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco the action scenes don t have the suspense of wrath of kahn the philosophy is boring and the humor is stale now i will focus most of my anger on william shatner when he takes the director s chair the ego gets bigger most of the focus is on him spock and mccoy but does not give the others enough to do moreover whereas shatner is usually guilty of over acting in previous movies and television spots he is just plain bad in this one now kirk is reckless a practical jokers and silly one of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song row row row your boat in a round by a campfire in any case this is the worst of the star trek franchise i should have given it three out of ten instead of five,0
6002,when it was released this film caused a sensation i watched it and was thrilled beautiful usually young naked women filmed in the classy style we knew so well from director hamiltons photography his photographs never become porn and the same is true for this movie today i saw it again and was bitterly disappointed the soft core in extremely slow paced scenes all filmed with some vaseline on the lenses actually is all there is there is no real story the characters remain beautiful and beautifully filmed bodies but they are not real creatures with a soul actually nothing happens it is like hamilton is photographing using moving pictures rather than stills and this gets so boring after a while i even didn t watch the whole thing the second time for i fell vast asleep that is all that remains of this masterpiece it is a very good sleeping pill and you will never become addicted to it back then 7 out of 10 now 3 out of 10,0
2192,this is more than just an adaptation of bond it s a plain rip off with mediocre character sketches that ian fleming would not have approved of this film goes down as the worst 007 movie an older even haggard connery tries to relive his past 12 years later the result is a humourless tacky version of the classic hero give me roger moore any day,0
23779,this was the best film of 1998 and one of the best of the 90 s yes it is a rip off of goodfellas but as the saying goes good poets borrow great poets steal and pta has stolen brilliantly from some of the best plus added some genius touches of his own i gave this a ten which is very rare for me the main reason i am commenting on this though cause i could just rave all night is all those people who have seen it on vhs standard issue what are you thinking this deserves the full screen experience look at the ratio it was shot in i saw it 5 times at the cinema and haven t bothered to watch it on video nuff said,1
851,outside sweden you are not expected have seen this movie happy you the cast includes several actors that are important part of modern the swedish movie history and still seems like peter dalle only had a an idea lasting for about 20 minutes robert gustafson is totally misused in this movie trying to copy a younger g sta ekman ekman by the way is the only actor fulfilling the expectations credit that can be given is for the photo splendid idea using black and white music is ok but over all it s a waste of god actors and the time of the audience,0
10965,this movie was extremely boring i only laughed a few times i decided to rent it when i noticed william shatner s name on the cover it s all about this little kid who gets picked on all the time by his classmates when wandering the streets looking for old ladies to assist he meets a prostitute she takes him to a club called the playground where he befriends several pimps when mayor tony gold shatner decides to take over the pimp business lil pimp must lay down for his homies the animation isn t very good in this it looks like it was made with macromedia which i m sure it was it doesn t suck it s just the sort of choppy flash animation that people have gotten used to over recent years the humor in this is not very good i didn t think any of it was funny,0
20354,warning reading this entry after watching the movie like easy rider released a year before joe tries to illustrate what happens when the counterculture and mainstream albeit right wing america meet a violent end ensues although this film is for the most part a slow moving display of traditional old fashion american morals versus the 60 s do what feels good lifestyle it is also a commentary on upper class vs lower middle class and their inability to meet in the middle as illustrated when the comptons meet the currans boyle s joe represents a generation stuck in the 1940s and 50s where kill a commie for mommy or jap or hippie for that matter is okay so long as it helps and saves america joe and wife mary jo are clearly the archetypes for archie bunker and dingbat wife edith this movie which will forever be known for it s violent but not bloody no blood is seen at all ending is uneven however joe blasts verbally the hippie generation then literally lays down with them to infiltrate their numbers to locate compton s daughter when clearly he should have been repulsed by the idea but forgoes the separatist idea for the sake of sex when he is betrayed through thievery read trust of the older generation to the newer generation he lashes out through an unrelenting chain of murder perhaps it is due to the tarantinos of hollywood that the watcher expects blood streaming death in the end scene but the bloodless shootings long for any sort of impact or realism joe is not a great movie but it is an interesting display of class and culture alienation and the animalistic underlying extremes to the generation gap,1
16929,not being a fan of the coen brothers or george clooney anyone can see the skepticism i took into the theater once again someone in hollywood dares to create something different this time it was those zanie for a temporary lack of a better word coens doing their thing to one of the great works in literary history who would ve ever thought homer had this in mind i don t know where this film is going to fit in the history books of hollywood but it will be in both mine and many others dvd or vhs library it is one of those films that you can watch over and over the story is brilliantly written clean and entertaining with a couple of gumpesque brushes with fame great performances by clooney turturro nelson and a brief but hilarious holly hunter being born in mississippi and raised in other parts of the south i wish more people would poke a little fun at us like this they even invoke a soundtrack fitting for the rural south you are not doing anything better this weekend go see this movie,1
12736,of the korean movies i ve seen only three had really stuck with me the first is the excellent horror a tale of two sisters the second and third and now fourth too have all been park chan wook s movies namely oldboy sympathy for lady vengeance and now thirst park kinda reminds me of quentin tarantino with his irreverence towards convention all his movies are shocking but not in a gratuitous sense it s more like he shows us what we don t expect to see typically situations that go radically against society s morals like incest or a libidinous blood sucking yet devout priest he s also quite artistically inclined with regards to cinematography and his movies are among the more gorgeous that i ve seen thirst is all that being about said priest and the repressed conscience less woman he falls for and more it s horror drama and even comedy as park disarms his audience with many inappropriate yet humorous situations as such this might be his best work for me yet since his other two movies that i ve seen were lacking the humor element that would ve made them more palatable for repeat viewings,1
2731,what i liked best about this flick was the chance to see joan woodbury who awe struck me as one of the several beauties in the charles boyer classic algiers in a leading role she does well as rita an orphan who rises to make good as a lady crime boss her ascent to the top reminds me of joan crawford s characters e g mildred pierce who realize their ambitions by fierce determination and willpower if you re looking for a film noir classic better look elsewhere at several points it s difficult to know where this story is going i first got the impression that it was going to encompass rita s plot for revenge against the father and son who tricked her into taking the rap for a drunk driving death perpetrated by the playboy son but payback time ended up being only a minor point and a springboard to the somewhat confusing second part of the film where rita becomes increasingly involved in city corruption anyway it s only 72 minutes so a second viewing should clear up any haziness my copy is from a platinum box set called mobster movies the picture quality is good but the soundtrack sucks constantly skipping fragments of dialog there are eight films in the 5 50 box making each movie a fair 69 cents look for anne archer s father john archer as rita s childhood friend bob alan ladd doesn t get much screen time it s definitely joan woodbury s picture,0
64,we brought this film as a joke for a friend and could of been our worst joke to play the film is barely watchable and the acting is dire the worst child actor ever used and hasslehoff giving a substandard performance the plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on it tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable just terrible,0
823,i honestly don t know where to begin when reviewing a movie as pathetic as ernest goes to africa aside from two or three good laughs dispersed throughout the film there is nothing positive about this hour and a half waste of time and life it is incredible that someone was able to round up a group of people willing to act film and edit this piece of trash and even more incredible that this is the eighth installment in the ernest series during the opening credits of the movie we see ernest posing next to various african objects such as wooden masks and the heads of african animals making faces and gestures that would probably make most 3rd graders laugh this opening scene gives the viewer a taste of ernest s frequent attempts at humor and demonstrates how his comedy falls flat 95 of the time the first thing that really hit me about this movie is how bad the acting is everyone in the film is a typical c movie actor but linda kash stands out as especially terrible she is the epitome of overacting all of her lines are delivered with shockingly inhuman enthusiasm that you d find only in a middle school play most high school theater students probably could have replaced these actors and delivered a more powerful performance jim varney at least displays some comedic ability every now and then but for the majority of the movie he just acts like a complete retard trying to be humorous by making stupid faces and speaking in different voices ernest goes to africa begins in africa where an archaeologist has stolen two priceless gems from an african tribe the gems then make their way back to the united states where an unidentified man is seen running from several henchmen through a flea market he hides them in a bucket of two for a dollar items and then runs from the scene ernest is looking for a gift to buy for rene a waitress he likes so he goes to the flea market and of course buys the priceless gems he later takes them back to his house paints them and glues them together to make a yo yo he gives the yo yo to rene and she explains that they can never be together because he is just an average shmoe and she wants a man of adventure rene and ernest are tracked down by the henchmen and are then brought to africa to be kept as prisoners most of the movie really doesn t make sense once ernest is in africa he falls out of the truck that they are carrying him in and lands in a river in the next scene we see him as a hindu servant named hey you his skin is dark and he is wearing a loin cloth at first i thought jim varney was playing another role in the film in addition to ernest but i immediately recognized ernest s idiocy once hey you began to speak another scene that sticks out in my mind as being completely ridiculous is the car chase scene in the african wilderness rene and ernest have taken an ostrich farmer s truck and are being chased by the henchmen driving at about twenty miles per hour on a fairly straight road both henchmen are shooting at ernest who is in the back of the ostrich farmer s truck ernest on the other hand is throwing ostrich eggs at the henchmen and their driver the henchmen never hit ernest once during the five minute chase but ernest is able to fend them off by hitting them and their driver in the face making their car swerve off the road and explode in a giant column of smoke i should also add that ernest is slingshotting the eggs two at a time from a large bra the set design is also incredibly poor in this movie there is a large portion of the film in which rene and ernest are walking in africa trying to find civilization during their hike we see them walking through fields and jungles which probably could have been shot anywhere in the united states the fields are simply plain grassy fields with no indication whatsoever of being anywhere near africa they could have at least digitally added some african trees in the background and the jungles look like the woods of rural connecticut with papier m ch skulls vines and thorns hanging from trees according to imdb com the film was actually shot in south africa but i still wouldn t believe that at all the movie goes on and on ernest joke after ernest joke the rest of the movie doesn t really make any sense either the african tribesmen all speak english for some reason and ernest is later challenged to a battle of truth by the lead henchman who is suddenly dressed in an outfit that resembles that of a ninja yet also somewhat resembles that of a bondage submissive the henchman has a table of axes swords knives and maces before him while ernest has a table with a sandwich a teddy bear and a few other worthless items however ernest wins the battle and somehow ends up saving the day overall this movie is painful to watch i couldn t handle it in one sitting i had to stop halfway through and do something productive for a few hours to compensate for the brain cells lost while trying to appreciate varney s humor they should really put a surgeon s general warning on the box to let people know that they will in fact be slightly more retarded upon finishing this movie i would have to say that out of all the movies i have ever seen none comes close to being as pitiable as ernest goes to africa,0
13105,this film is about a single mother who is happy go lucky to the point that she is almost irresponsible and her sensible teenage daughter who is undergoing adolescent turmoils anywhere but here is an engaging film from beginning to the end both ann and adele are described well right at the start so we get to know how different their personalities are clashes inevitably ensue and they are engagingly presented i find myself so drawn to their state of minds and their circumstances it is as if i am living their lives feeling what they are feeling susan sarandon gives another excellent performance in anywhere but here she is charismatic happy go lucky hedonistic warm and loving all at once i have always liked susan sarandon and i think she is grossly underrated anywhere but here is a captivating emotional journey,1
23222,the movie touches the soul of the audience very much some scene in the movie is ultimate and tears comes out automatically i m surprised by seeing this movie that any director can direct this type of movie in the year 1925 as a student of cinema i can say this movie helps a lot to understand use of montage first time when our teacher told us about this movie means genre of this movie we thought nothing could be there in this movie to understand but finally when sir explained it then we came to know how great this movie is lastly i can say it helps a lot understanding films and being a cinema student i can the viewers that they can see this movie,1
13000,victor mature as a barely civilized and mostly out of control mountain man and trapper may be on the poster but robert preston as a failed union colonel who led his men to get cut to ribbons by confederate artillery at shiloh and is sent to a fort in oregon for his incompetence has the most interesting part married to a young and hard to recognize at first anne bancroft the uncivilized mature lusts for the colonel s wife giving the film an interesting and even dark subplot which goes so far as to reference coveting another man s wife at one point by james whitmore who plays mature s older and wiser mountain man father figure directed by anthony mann this film is lost among his more famous westerns with james stewart but even so you really don t need the indian menace to make this a film worth seeing although preston gets to prove his bad judgement as a commanding officer again in a failed expedition to finally bring the indians under submission in a well staged attack among the forest that quickly turns into a rout,1
15946,excellent entry in the rko saint series with well written original script good camera work and transitions good directing to handle some twists in the plot good editing to keep the flow constant and good acting george sanders is suave and witty jonathan hale simply is inspector fernack paul guilfoyle plays a mobster who goes straight and drinks milk because he cannot take the pressure he will return in a later entry in the series story begins on an ocean liner headed to the u s where the saint meets but cannot connect with wendie barrie she eventually succumbs to the saint s charms but she breaks his heart in the end the saint assists inspector fernack clear his name from a frame a few bodies fall along the way good entertainment and above average for this type of film watch it,1
5881,i am shocked to see that this movie has been given more than two stars by some people they must either be kidding or be totally blind for the art of acting directing and other flaws of the movie i must admit that i just could not force myself to sit through the whole movie it was just too bad the three first characters not including the digger were just awful actors and i mean awful maybe the director didn t care or may be he is a worse director it was like watching a bad school play the movie was of course filmed with a video camera lowbudget not real film and the light settings were not very good either in addition the sound man if they had one must either have been a newbie or a drunk as the sound were amateurish even in one of the first scenes from the kitchen awful acting btw the sound from the dialog was pretty bad for example when the woman moved her head while speaking you could hear her voice disappear and come back it sounded like they had tried to correct that in post production by turning up the volume a bit when she turns her head in addition you had the ongoing irritating buzzing sound from either camera equipment or other sources in the kitchen all these squeakers in the first 5 minutes or so need i say more a good school project or fun project for friends to watch but should never have been released for a real audience especially not for a paying audience this was a rip off unless you have a very low standard regarding movies or just bad taste you are warned sb,0
15476,i not only consider this to be the best film that jon voight midnight cowboy coming home has ever done but a real tribute to teachers despite incredible odds pat conroy voight managed to reach a group of students and bring them from nowhere to a basic literacy and awareness of the world his methods made be criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like mr skeffington hume cronyn but teachers like conroy will always be winners voight really showed that he had a love for teaching and that it was a natural high for him he didn t overplay the role and i found him to be totally believable voight is conrack besides a love of teaching we also see another important point in this film no matter how good you are at your job if you rock the boat the bureaucrats will get you,1
11714,this movie was included in the six wives of henry viii bbc miniseries dvd i loved those six movies they were well acted well scripted and historically accurate i did actually read gregory s book and liked it well enough despite it s huge historical inaccuracies i mean the whole fake homosexual angle with george boleyn in particular but this movie didn t even mention that that angle was one of the pivotal points of the book above all this movie just leaves me asking why why do we see as someone else aptly put the real world tudor england why are the camera angles so bad in general why is the script so bad i mean i know it was improv but come on the actors at time stutter and stammer over their lines and it s obvious that they re making them up as they go along why are the sex scenes so awkward the way they were done in the book made them at least somewhat interesting in the movie they re just bad verging on being absolutely hilarious at one point the actress playing mary boleyn was having sex with the actor playing henry viii he s thrusting away and she s got this look on her face that says hm i need to go to the store is he done yet maybe if he finishes i can go pick up some cheese real quick it s just bad why does catherine of aragon play such a small role in this movie her refusal to get a divorce was one of the leading causes for the scandal that rocked christiandom she s the reason why henry viii and anne boleyn couldn t get immediately married why is she not present here over all this movie is just bad,0
21061,saw this movie when it came out and then a couple more times years later i m watching it now 20 years later and it s still a very good story does it wreak of lifetime movie network yes but alas lifetime was not even in existence back then so it needed somehwere to air the cast was excellent the story was a little schmaltzy two women become close friends and unbeknownst to either one friend is having an affair with he other friends husband she s invited over to the house for a dinner party which is how she discovers that her lover is the husband of her best friend she is horrified and tries to break off the affair shortly afterwards he is tragically killed in a car accident which is devatating for both women of course the wife finds out by accident about this affair and wants holly out of her life now but their friendship is able to prevail because they need each other i thought it was a very good story a great cast and perfomrances i really enjoyed it,1
7190,i decided to watch this ultra low budget film from the poverty row studio prc because it co starred the exciting character actor lionel atwill plus i really liked the title even though atwill often played in these cheap movies his excellent style of acting always made the films seem a lot better as his screen persona was great his real life is also quite interesting sort of like a bizarre soap opera the reason i use the term poverty row is that this was a nickname given to the very cheapest and worst production companies of the era many of these weren t even real studios but production companies that rented space and sets from the major studios at night yes there is a good chance this was filmed after normal working hours a common thing for such studios the story begins with lionel atwill telling his friends a story about something that he was involved with years ago a doctor falls in love with a lady but he s afraid to tell her about himself that s because his job is putting people to death on death row not exactly a glamor job the doc asks his friend atwill for advice on how to break it to her but regardless she won t have the man later you realize it s because her own parents were criminals later a man is killed and the lady is implicated though it s obvious to anyone with a brain that her sister was involved and is a bit of a nut and the evidence against the lady was poor but apparently the jury was filled with brainless people and she was convicted and sent to death row even more brainless is that her old boyfriend was the man who was responsible for her execution don t you think someone else might just be able to handle this case until this fateful hour her friend atwill spends much of the film trying to prove her innocence and prove that the flaky sister knows far more about the case than she ll admit overall the movie is only mildly interesting and a bit silly while it is watchable and atwill is good as usual the rest of the film never really rises above the mundane and some of the acting is pretty shabby it s sub par and about what you d expect from such a low budget flick and nothing more despite the cool title,0
5713,i was a huge snl fan back in the days of chevy chase john belushi dan ackroyd gilda radner and many other memorable stars but every time i ve tried to watch it in the past more than ten years i ve been very disappointed and sometimes even disgusted with it ten years ago i believed the show couldn t possibly survive since it had become so utterly bereft of the sort of humor i could understand and yet it kept plugging along which i ve always found dismaying wondering how in the world anyone could possibly find its lame humor at all funny whenever i ve tuned in over the past decade i ve never once been glad that i did indeed i ve always been annoyed at myself for staying up and wasting my time for me the absolute low point came several years ago when a popular young male actor i liked a lot was the guest host at one point that night he played a big star perhaps himself and in the skit the character mongo i think played by chris kattan again i think ended up in the backseat of a car with him what followed was mongo being forced up and down and up and down on the actor s lap with him screaming hysterically as he was presumably sodomized the audience was laughing their heads off and i m shaking my head amazed that they could find that remotely funny amazed that nbc would even broadcast such a thing in the years since then i ve repeatedly tried to approach the show with an open mind hoping that it might regain the sly sense of humor i adored for so many years but up until just a week ago for me it hasn t done so not even close one exception during the 2008 presidential campaign i thought that tina fey was fantastic and she was the one performer who kept me tuning in but those sarah palin skits while hysterical were still not enough to save the rest of the 90 minutes and i would always regret not turning it off as soon as i heard the familiar it s saturday night,0
23844,julie brown hilariously demolishes madonna s attempt at a rockumentary with gut ripping humor and truly original and catchy songs that rival madonna s own cinematography and sets are top notch kathy griffin and chris elliott offer their own injections of comedy that enhances and compliments this film appearances by bobcat goldthwait and wink martindale as themselves is an added bonus it s hard to tell if brown s performance is meant to insult or playfully tease madonna though i hardly think the material girl would find humor in it my favorite line why don t you come here to the phillipines all they eat is dog and i m a vegetarian,1
4719,this movie started with some promise big name cast good looking sets but then it fell apart most of the time it can t tell whether it s a serious movie or a comedy one minute they re talking about how there s no joy in killing and the next there is a fight scene set to funny music and funny banter some of the acting is pretty bad mainly from patrick swayze and piper perabo she also gets some groaner lines like when i marry it will be about love ugh but the worst thing about this movie is that it s just boring not enough action not enough humor not enough plot not much of anything really just a lot of clich s and cheesy moments also a movie with dragon in the title should contain a lot more dragons than the few and pathetic cgi dragons that appeared in this movie can t the scifi channel show any good movies,0
7575,this film isn t a little bad it s not even kind of bad it s horrid you know you re in trouble when charo shows up in a film she must have had the week off from love boat george kennedy at least he s a gamer he s in there trying actually he s all right and it s good to see martha raye jimmie walker s okay there s slightly better acting than in airport 75 but what film doesn t have better acting than airport 75 one thing i liked about this film is that it had more going on than a lot of other disaster films plot wise at least they made an attempt at subplots what really hurts this film is the special effects ugh not too special if you ask me this is the kind of film that at 2am is truly truly funny if you ve been up having fun with your buddies and you re looking for something to laugh at,0
18112,haha what a great little movie wayne crawford strikes again or rather this was his first big strike a deliriously entertaining little ball of manic kitsch energy masquerading as a psycho killer movie it s actually a brilliant satire on post hippie american culture in flyover country though the movie was actually filmed independently in miami it defies any kind of studio oriented convention or plot device that i can think of sometimes aunt martha does dreadful things may not be a very technically adept movie but it is a wonderful little slice of americana made on the cheap by people who were honest ambitious imaginative and had balls made out of steel it took guts nerve and guile to make this movie which amazingly appears to have stood the test of time this movie is fresh vital alive unforgettable and charmingly weird enough to recommend to just about anyone with a sense of humor i dug up last year during a period of time when i was fascinated by star wayne crawford here billed under his pseudonym scott lawrence a maestro of what can only be called regional film making usually of the b grade variety he s a writer producer director and actor all in one probably best known for the 80s teen apocalyptic favorite night of the comet here he plays stanley the pants wearing half of a couple of truly marvelous characters apparently homosexual spree killers on the lam after knocking off some old lady in baltimore for her jewelry unsung screen legend abe zwick is completely convincing as paul who poses as stanley s aunt martha the cross dressing brains of the outfit who has conned stanley into thinking he s committed murder to ensure his loyalty martha looks about as feminine as the sailors from south pacific s supporting choir in their coconut bikini tops yet somehow nobody seems to notice or care that she is a he has no visible means of income seems to spend all day fretting about where stanley is and scurries around the neighborhood in her bathrobe carrying a butcher s knife only in america as the film opens the two of them have just arrived in florida and set up residence in what looks like ward cleaver s old house a garishly lit designed television home that is so clich as to be surreal during one memorable scene martha and an unwelcome house guest sit on the couch talk problems and drink cans of budweiser in what is one of the most mesmerizing subversively ordinary sequences i ve ever seen outside of a john waters movie then there s stanley always getting into trouble as he is a mop topped hippie with an stp patch on his vest who drives a psychedelic painted van that s about as subtle as the batmobile drinks his milk straight from the carton snorts drugs with blond bombshell bimbos and hoards donuts in an old cigar box for a quick snack opposites attract i guess but stanley also has a thing about not liking it when the young ladies he gets stoned with try to remove his pants and it always seems to be up to aunt martha to get him out of the trouble that inevitably results the bodies pile up a nosy junkie blackmails them into using their house as a flop stanley s birthday cake gets squashed and everybody meets down at the local pizza shop before heading to the wood shed on the back property for a hookah hash party where the girls dance in their underwear things get out of hand when one of the neighbors tries to get a bit too chummy with martha who naturally prefers to keep people at an arm s length when they rudely invite themselves over for a nice chat and this is a woman who carries not just a butcher knife but a loaded 38 in her slip eventually the strange duo find themselves stuck with a body a baby and no place to go and end up taking refuge at an abandoned movie studio where no doubt the technical crew borrowed the equipment used to make the film i just hope they politely asked for permission first and cleaned up after themselves a word of course must be said about stanley and martha paul s relationship since to dance around the fact that the two are at least suggested to be a homosexual couple would be to miss the primary gist of the plot we never see the two of them get intimate and indeed even though stanley mockingly refers to being balled in one scene their relationship is more symbiotic than sexual it certainly isn t a gay movie with abundant female nudity and an air of 70s misogyny that cannot be denied either stanley paul never consummating their implied sexuality on screen even though the movie certainly would have had the guts to do so if it were important it isn t the story isn t about their sex it s about the bond they share and how weird it is not their being gay but their being the distinct individuals they are who are two of the strangest movie creations ever to inhabit my tv set the film is unique it was made for only a few thousand dollars on what look like borrowed studio sets the occasional location work and an couple of public locations they managed to sneak a camera crew into when nobody was looking the dialog is completely bizarre mundane and delightfully esoteric it s a movie that will take you by surprise not everyone will like it but for those with a taste for low budget american horror thrillers like the night god screamed help me i m possessed blood lace and children shouldn t play with dead things you ve got yourself a winner here 8 10 usually i d say something like deserves a dvd restoration but somehow i think doing so would ruin the movie s tacky ambiance and wayne crawford you sir rule,1
24961,i have seen most of the tarzan episodes certainly the rated x with o keeffe bo derek which is totally deplorable i have seen this version several times since it was originally shown all the cast had memorable parts great acting the ape sequences last night i viewed same on spanish station and other than some french dialog all in spanish as far as hudson not wanting andie s voice he did nothing until the very end he viewed the dailies and could have hired a dialog coach it seems silly that a story about apes and a man raised by them all speaking gibberish that hudson attacked andie the story line in the movie was that she was an american cousin the last time i checked carolina was in the usa she was beautiful in movie and her eyes and gorgeous hair alabaster skin mystified all us males she did not have to resort to bo s level she has remained a lady throughout the rest of her career and should look at this movie half her life ago as a starting point her performance sincerity made this movie enjoyable believable that a half wild man could ascertain her inner beauty great sending point for sir richardson he did steal the movie,1
12854,me and my mates used to gather together in one house to watch this on a friday night before going to the pub it was the only programme that ever made us miss opening time it is one of the best comedies i have ever watched if not the best david jason was brilliant and was compared many times to buster keaton with his clever stunts that were pulled off so believably i wish i could get hold of the series on dvd to watch again he had an amazing ability to make stupid things look believable and this series shows how much talent he has in so many different directions he is an accomplished trip and fall guy and i remember watching a trailer once where he showed people how to do this professionally certainly he is the one to teach people this art he only showed glimpses of it in other programs he did pshaw this program shows how multi talented he is i am lost as to why david jason vetoed another series being made as for my mind it was one of the best things he has ever done and i ve been a fan of his since he did this series it is said he did not like it because it showed the rawness of his early career well to my mind that might possibly have been the right decision when he took it but now his career has progressed so far i believe this would be a good time for him to do another series showing him looking back on his secret life full of blunders that he does not see rod,1
995,when they announced this movie for tnt i was excited a travesty from donald westlake s enough was one of my all time favorite stories after i watched it i was not all that thrilled recently i had the chance to watch it a second time with my aunt and once again i was disappointed she didn t like it much either and she d never read the book in this movie they managed to sap all the charm from the book and turn it into dull mush a big part of the problem was william h macy i like him fine in other films but he played terry carey thorpe as a stammering incompetent yutz in the book thorpe takes a lot of valium for his nerves but remains outwardly collected at almost all times which is part of the fun spoilers follow they also left out a big part of the story other than a 2 second glimpse at the embassy where thorpe solves not 1 but 4 homicides for the police this is important not just because it s funny but because it helps set up the relationship between fred and thorpe in the movie fred s betrayal in the end is not nearly as affecting because they don t seem all that close in the book they become pretty good friends especially on fred s side which makes it all the more ironic that he is he one that arranges thorpe s downfall fred also suffered a bit from casting i love adam arkin but he was not a cheerful happy to be alive upbeat sort of detective character traits which book fred possesses which makes it more obviously out of character for him to mess with evidence and thus more shocking patricia and edgarson were pretty close to the book and james cromwell was great despite not looking much like martin balsam the whole boring boat house scene which was entirely added for the film was much less interesting than the police finding edgarson s body after thorpe ships it to seattle and blaming the death on the mob kit was okay although she was mostly rewritten and it would have been nice to see her die as she did get slightly annoying i don t mind changes to books to make movies i know they are necessary because of length and difficulty but it would have been nice if some of the changes in this movie had been funnier or smarter instead of duller,0
6457,it s as if this town has the power to suck your brain right out of your head pattipatti christina ricci is a sarcastic teenaged girl bored with her all too average little town bored that is until a woman is kidnapped and she finds what she believes to be clues to the poor lady s whereabouts now with the help of her precious cat d c and an inept fbi agent doug e doug she must find her that darn cat is a bad movie it is quite foolish and it has humor that often falls quite flat there are however a few buds of talent in it doug e doug was good in cool runnings his performance as senga was really funny here he is wasted as the bumbling fbi agent he does have a good scene when he imitates the cat though micheal mckean plays patti s father his character must be the most understanding parent to ever live this poor guy has his expensive cigar crushed gets arrested for picking up his own cat and gets bitched at by his snippy wife and still doesn t get angry at his daughter for causing all of his troubles i wish my old man was like that the only real good performance is christina ricci s she entertaining as the ever annoyed patti but her occasional very bad dialogue pulls her performance down you might also recognize peter boyle young frankenstein everybody loves raymond the old lady from wings and cliff from cheers in this movie this is a movie that all these actors would probably like to forget even the cat isn t very good i really can t recommend 1997 s that darn cat some young children under 8 might enjoy it a bit but every one else should look elsewhere if you re looking for a good christina ricci movie i suggest addams family values the opposite of sex or sleepy hollow if a fun family film is what you re after try snow day instead,0
15269,15 park avenue well the name mystifies initially being an address from new york and film being set in kolkata however as the story unfolds one realize the thin line that director tries to walk between relationships social cause and of course the world of schizophrenia i would say aparna sen is one director who has so much more to say and has so less time at disposal well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie in a way she makes us realize that probably each one of us is looking for our own 15 park avenue its an unending search within each of one of us the powerhouse performance from shabana azmi is a treat to watch her screen presence brings whole lot of life into the scene indeed it was surprising to see her in such a powerful act after long because i expected it to be all the way konkona sen s terrain shabana makes you feel skin deep of an elder sister who is running the whole show for a rather unfortunate family and during this time she almost forgets to live her own life she burdens all her ambitions and desires with ailing 18 year younger sister who is more like a daughter to her and an aging mother played by veteran waheeda rehman as for the leading actress from guide that s how i can recall her instantly there is hardly anything to say except few lines and tear drops here and there ever dependable rahul bose plays another pivotal role in the film he shows the emotions of a middle age man with repent on his face to near perfection this man really amazes me with the variety of work he has done from a musician in jhankar beats to a liberal muslim in mr mrs iyer and so many others he is one versatile i really wish if he had some more shots in the first part of the movie as well the cameo in the movie is by shefali shah remember satya and monsoon wedding she looks really beautiful and depicts the role of a mother of 2 kids with real ease she gives you a glimpse of today s indian woman who is modern in approach but still conventional when it comes to her husband s prior relationships the focus of camera has been meethi portrayed by konkona she and her schizophrenic world constitute the nucleus of 15 park avenue she has really worked hard for the character but there are times when she is not able to relate with the audience the fateful accident of her life tries to rope in sympathy and it has been only partially successful the movie tries to address quite a few things in one go starting from the unique world of a disabled person to the unequal status of a female even in today s modern india and also the twisted relationships in a tattered family and i believe aparna has succeeded to certain extent the helplessness of meethi while she works as a journalist in a rural eastern state really gives us all a naked picture of the country we are so proud of well after i finished 15 park avenue there was a sense of unquenched thirst within me i wanted more out of this movie to drench me emotionally it has been a commendable effort on the part of director except few hiccups must watch for all those who like to see a different cinema something with a strong purpose,1
11666,yes why among the filmmakers that came out in the 80 s and 90 s gus van sant is one of my idols there are others a few steven sodebergh pt anderson tim hunter danny boyle martin donovan harmony korine wes anderson idiosyncratic infuriating some times but consistent surprising unpredictable their names make me switch on the tv go to a video store or even buy a ticket and go to a movie theater van sant s psycho however gives me pause why i wonder a shot by shot massacre of one of the perennial classics the color was jarring the performances atrocious what was vince vaughn doing was it a parody a bad joke what the hell was it anne heche as janet leigh who dressed her viggo mortensen with a cowboy hat viggo is a superb actor but in this case he couldn t make us forget john gavin and if julianne moore had been introduced to the world through this performance there wouldn t have been any the hours for her the minutes maybe so here i am bad mouthing the work of one of my idols the crashing question remains why mr van sant maybe in the words of president clinton because he could i m afraid that s no excuse,0
17387,the movie jennifer with ida lupino and howard duff is film noir magnificence this is a mostly unknown movie that all film noir fans should see jennifer was filmed with the most unusual camera angles for that time which made the movie have a surreal like quality at times i love the stark black and white film noir movies film noir in color is not as good the cast and script is excellent the rather creepy music is fun to listen to ida lupino is one of the best and talented actresses to ever grace the screen i have never seen a production that she was in that i did not like she was not only breathtakingly beautiful she was a fine actress the first movie that i remember seeing ida lupino in was roadhouse with richard widmark and cornel wilde i never forgot the movie or her i saw her last films like food of the gods and women in chains and even though the movies were not her usual fare she was still delightful in them as an actress howard duff is always terrific to watch i highly recommend this masterpiece to everyone i have this movie on vhs tape,1
1664,of all the films i have seen this one the rage has got to be one of the worst yet the direction logic continuity changes in plot script and dialog made me cry out in pain how could anyone come up with something so crappy gary busey is know for his b movies but this is a sure w movie w waste take for example about two dozen fbi local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer inside the jeep is ma and is confused as to why all the cops are about within seconds a huge gun battle ensues ma being killed straight off the cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them the cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet pellet ma is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed damn that guy is tough truly a miracle not since the six shooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle,0
2558,i cannot believe this show was okay ed first off j p manoux does a horrible job filling in for david spade and pacha s voice is too deep compared to john goodman s the theme song is so annoying and the plots of the episodes are so stupid the only good thing about this show is that eartha kitt and patrick warburton remain as the voices of yzma and kronk this show is a waste of money and a waste of your time half of the episodes are copied of the movie in my opinion the emperor s new groove was one of the best children s movies in years but they complety ruined by making kronk s new groove and this show you should watch such shows as spongebob fairly oddparents danny phantom or kim possible but not this show,0
1679,i starred as eugene morris jerome in my high school adaptation of the play and this film definitely doesn t live up to the script or the imagination of neil simon i know this play backwards and forwards and i can honestly tell you that the acting was off the production was cheesy the changes in the play s script were poorly done if you want to really enjoy this play you should see the actual play not a hollywood movie adaptation the eugene character lacked soul and was overly sarcastic in all he said the other characters were off key as well a general disappointment messy disloyal to the play amateurishly executed,0
17389,i wish i could have met ida lupino when people ask who you if you could have 6 extraordinary 20th century persons over for dinner well for me one person would be her i think she is now one of the great unsung and unprofiled personalities in the film industry her life story would make a great tele movie hey mr bogdanovich ida lupino has been the driving force in many fascinating noir films of the 40s and 50s i can remember being saddened at seeing her reduced to a horrible part in a ghastly aip film is the late 70s she was bitten by a big worm at the kitchen sink ugh i should have contacted her then as she died not long after more from the part than the worm too from high sierra roadhouse and the extraordinary rko thriller on dangerous ground ida lupino was often the producer and the lead actress later with her husband howard duff they produced many now timeless noir dramas that are still very engrossing today one of them is jennifer which i think is the last film with a monogram pictures copyright monogram changed the company name formally to allied artists in 1953 and jennifer has both company names on the opening credits this is a superior haunted house thriller equally as scary as both the innocents and the haunting made 8 years later really chilling and very creepy this tiny film is exactly the sort of really good film ida lupino made and was responsible for try and find it you will always remember it and as i feel much admiration for this great and almost forgotten actress producer,1
16753,this episode so far is the best of the series the story was told perfectly i especially liked how the writers made it a desmond episode it was his best performance to date and he definitely deserved the emmy for his performance we had some of our questions answered in this episode but since the show is called lost we know there will be more questions brought up too first the answered walt is reunited finally with his father michael second michael s betrayal is exposed to jack sawyer kate and hurly and because of this betrayal kate jack and sawyer are all taken captive by the others this was a great way to end the show on the other side of the island we see locke going through a mental breakdown with the button this leads to another answered question about how the plane really went down however there are some unanswered questions first what happened to locke eko and desmond when desmond turned the failsafe key and what was the deal with the scientists in the arctic searching for electromagnetic annamolies guess we ll find out next season however great ending to the best show on tv,1
22052,wow it s been a long time since i ve last seen such a hilarious movie like this one i ve never been a great fanatic about french movies but ever since i fell in love with the beauty and the acting skills of catherine deneuve i decided to see all of her movies however i didn t think this one would be so fantastic as it turned out to be lucky me that i bought it even though i had some doubts this is really feel good time film with class and quality there are some great social topics and moral drama s involved that are very close to today s modern way of living which are shown very beautiful and realistic i also liked the dancing scene in the men s room a lot but my favourite is the rather timid attempt of catherine deneuve to sing she brings it the way she is with lots of grace and modesty at the same time very tempting further on i would also like to express my respect and admiration for line renaud who played a fantastic role i didn t even know she acted i ve only known her for her music so don t wait any longer and go see the movie you ll be surprised in many ways,1
5625,truly awful obviously an attempt to cash in on the star wars craze but there s no excuse for this insipid piece of garbage the storyline gets lost before the middle the characters are forgettable and the kid is such a non talent that all he does is pose for the camera an alien planet they land on is actually the naval stockyards in long beach california this movie actually made me physically ill watching it roger corman has made some good some bad movies in his career but there s no excuse for this one 0 10 imdb won t let you score a zero,0
15944,i want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary it is obviously a labor of love and i think they did a pretty good job of putting together an enjoyable documentary about a person who has had so such little info available about him it definitely has a fan worship feel about it which is a good thing i had heard of bruce haack but didn t know much about him and i found the start of this documentary frustrating because i could hear other musicians talk about him but bruce haack himself was kept way too far off in the distance i wanted to see this bruce haack guy i felt as though the makers assumed i already knew him as well as these musicians on the screen which i didn t so i felt a bit left in the dark when bruce was finally shown in action it was great and gave me a taste of who bruce haack was but it was only a taste we got treated to more musicians and i felt as though i was being told look all these cool musicians are into him so he must be cool i didn t really care much for the musician s commentary on bruce i wanted to see bruce as a person you know the important stuff more interviews with people who worked with him or knew him more about his life and yes his use of drugs and other issues i would of liked to know so much more about his hackula project i wanted to get inside his mind even if they did this via some voice of god commentary and photos it would of been ok the animations were good but again i felt these were used as filler they didn t really do anything other than allow me to hear his music and see some imagery based on the dimension 5 records i did think it was clever and creative but again i wanted to learn more about bruce maybe bruce haack was this elusive in real life anyway in the end i enjoyed this documentary and felt a sort of sadness that such amazing pioneers and geniuses such as mr haack get forgotten as the march of time stamps ever onwards i am glad that this film is around to educate people about bruce haack even with its flaws,1
5988,produced at a point in his career where he had the juice to do whatever he wanted eddie murphy took on the task of producing directing co writing and starring in harlem nights an expensive looking but ultimately empty gangster saga about a group of black nightclub owners gangsters running a ritzy club during the 1930 s headed by a wisecracking hot shot eddie murphy and his adopted father richard pryor and their attempts to avoid being overrun by white gangsters who think they are taking over turf that it seems they think is rightfully theirs simply by virtue of their color this was an idea that probably looked great on paper but it definitely lost something in the translation this was a vanity piece for eddie and i think he spreads himself a little too thin here trying to be the whole show here admittedly it was a pleasure seeing murphy and pryor together on screen but the rest of the large supporting cast including arsenio hall redd foxx della reese michael lerner danny aiello jasmine guy thomas mikal ford stan shaw and eddie s brother are really given precious little to do though i will admit murphy s fight scene with della reese is hysterically funny and probably the movie s best scene murphy clearly poured a lot of money into this film and a good deal of it shows on screen the art and set direction are impressive and the breathtaking costumes should have won an oscar but this one was a big miss for eddie as he definitely tried to wear too many hats,0
5699,you see a movie titled battlespace what are you going to think space battles with cool as heck explosions and everyone shooting at each other what do you get with this movie well you do get some space battle goodness but for a great majority of the time it s just stupid people wandering around doing almost nothing no one talks what is this nonsense we get a narrators and a ton of british computers but thats about it the main protagonist must be the worst one i have ever seen as she doesn t even have any dialog and sleepwalks though scenes literately some of the things happening are just stupid like they use a rocket like to go to space for basic transportation planet side why not just use one of those nifty space ships in any case the music is almost non existent with a few boring dull lifeless samples but the main thing you will notice is the atari sound effects the ships use you have got to be kidding me i can also tell that the budget was low because everything looks fake which is not what you would expect from a movie especially what should be a super cool space battle movie i seriously think the budget must have been in the double digits it is so bad making you laugh more than you should at how plain bad it is i am starting to think that they paid the actors based on how much dialog they had because their is very little here if you can t tell already that is my main gripe here as i probably said that like 3 times already,0
19115,it s very true that this film defies convention by not spelling out the plot for the viewer while some may have a problem with having to figure it out for themselves i embrace uzumaki for its irreverence there is a plot it s just that it may not be immediately accessible to a lazy viewer this is a film that invites numerous interpretations as all great art does however this film is also very entertaining making it a rare film experience it s simultaneously provocative and fun,1
11197,gordon scott with his well coiffed hair hourglass figure and weird pidgin english has to be the worst of all the tarzans as for the other actors in this mess they re on a par with any 4th grade elementary school drama class i ve seen used car dealers in tv commercials who can act better they make clayton moore look like laurence olivier and where does jane the dull eve brent get her lipstick and eyebrow pencils in the jungle i realize these were made for kids but wow the plot line seemed ok but the director should have required more from his actors i realize even the weissmuller films have a few flaws but this one seemed so low budget,0
20303,when is art going to overcome racism i believe the american people have grown up since this movie was made porgy consists of a stellar cast and music this motion picture is an excellent adaptation of a great opera i e miss saigon is based on madame butterfly les miz is based on a classic book recently an opera has been introduced here in los angeles based on the movie the fly an opera so be it disney is hesitating about releasing song of the south the naacp has voiced no contest for race issues and let us not forget amos n andy was a huge hit in the 50 s as a tv series ethnicity is our heritage in the u s and we should embrace all forms of ethnic artistic diversity please release porgy on dvd j hartz,1
6966,first off the initial concept of a lost fortune in gold bars discovered in a new zealand lake inside a downed world war 2 plane is a great opening what follows is nothing but cartoon like drivel men chasing men cars chasing men helicopters chasing men helicopters chasing boats boats chasing boats for the better part of an hour the most boring nonsense with absolutely no advancement to the story special mention must be made of the chop shop editing as many scenes seem to have been spliced together in random order the acting by all concerned is an embarrassment one last thing the picture quality and sound quality is so bad on this dvd that you will be appalled merk,0
23042,i had never read any of sarah waters novels or watched tipping the velvet i only heard about fingersmith when i was flipping through the l word websites the storyline of fingersmith interested me yet i passed it away thinking lesbian in victorian period that never ends well i have enough of those lesbo series and movies that go no where however during christmas my local dvd store gave fingersmith a discount i brought the dvd and my life has never been more colourfulthis mini series deserves to be cherished and praised the acting is so great that i call it rare sally hawkins elaine cassidy rupert evans imelda staunton and many more that i can t name all brought light and darkness to their characters just by a little gesture a little look a little touch they made their characters real and as a viewer i couldn t help it but take them home keep them close fingersmith sets in victorian area is a story of sue a thief who loves and lives with her family of pick pockets little did she know that her fate is linked to maud lily a somewhat shy timid girl grows up in a mansion miles and miles away maud s mother left her a fortune but maud herself can t touch it unless she married worst of all maud s uncle makes sure she never will by keeping her prisoned in the house enter mr gentlement a charming good looking thief with a heart as bad as any he wants maud s fortune for himself and in order to do so he sets sue up as maud lily s maid asking sue to persuade maud to elope with him as time goes by things would be simple if sue didn t fall in love with maud and things would be simple if the story was what i have just told i do not wish to spoil so i would like to stop there but i can asure you that everything is twisted and turned before you can even aware of what has happened once it happened you then question what would happen next on top of that the story is filled with passion unlike any others there are no self searching sexuality questioning oh my god do i like girls moments because the girls in fingersmith are buried so deep in their own darkness that they barely be able to care the story with such twisted plot moves as smooth as water running passionately but strangely calm weeks have passed since i watched fingersmith yet maud s eyes still haunt me and sue s words still warm my heart you pearl you pearl you pearl she said and such pearl it is,1
133,despite having a very pretty leading lady rosita arenas one of my boy crushes the acting and the direction are examples of what not to do while making a movie placed in southern mexico popoca the aztec mummy real aztecs by the way did not made mummies has been waken up by the lead characters and starts making trouble in mexico city suburbia during the first movie the aztec mummy in this second part the leading man and woman want to find th mummy and put it in its final resting place a fireplace would have been my first choice into this appears the bat a criminal master mindless stereotype of a criminal genius who creates a human robot some idiot inside a robot suit to control popoca and get this take over the world the final match between the robot and the mummy is hilarious some of the worst choreography ever witnessed the funniest part is that this movie was made and released by a serious mexican movie studio the acting is just as awful hearing the movie in spanish as it is in english they dubbed the over acting you should watch this movie through mst 3000 the comments are even funnier,0
7849,with awful movies like this one being even considered let alone being made it s very easy to see why hollywood is in such serious trouble with bad plots and worse remakes all the time i guess the viewer is supposed to be laughing their rear ends off over the black in jokes the pimped up look and the bling it s so incredible over the top and so bad that is even past the so bad it s funny again mark and have plummeted right into totally embarrassing for anyone involved i m very very sorry for every single minute i wasted on this one i want my time back save yourself the agony do not watch this the only reason for me to give even 1 point in the rating is that 0 wasn t an option,0
5063,going into teaching mrs tingle all i wanted was a fun enjoyable teen comedy that would entertain me for it s running time despite a rather good first half hour the film quickly subsides into a dull clich d mess that s about as entertaining as pulling out your eyelashes with pliers rusty pliers at that scream writer kevin williamson wrote and directed this movie and proved that scream may well have been a fluke most of the elements of this movie have been seen a million times already in other films and while it was ok for him to steal elements from other movies in scream due to the fact that it s meant as a slasher tribute here it just looks like he s completely ran out of ideas the plot follows the cleverest girl in school played by katie holmes after being caught cheating along with two of her friends the three decide to take the teacher that caught them hostage in her own home however this isn t just any teacher it s mrs tingle the meanest bitch in school she isn t taking being tied to the bed lying down either as she begins to play mind games to turn her captors against each other the plot is very similar to the 1997 flick suicide kings and a whole host of earlier films it s actually not a bad idea for a movie and if williamson could have populated the film with interesting characters it could have worked really well the character of mrs tingle is the most interesting in the movie but she s massively one dimensional and like all the other characters in the film is merely a caricature the acting is largely diabolical with the exception of helen mirren in the title role she s suitably evil in the role and while she doesn t have a lot to get her teeth into she clearly enjoys herself playing the central figure the teenage cast isn t worth mentioning with only katie holmes standing out and that s only really because of her star profile not her acting talents williamson has draped nearly every scene in dull soft rock music which would be really annoying if the film wasn t absolutely terrible anyway honestly this movie does have a few moments that are rather good but basically if you want to see a good example of the teen comedy this isn t the movie that you want to see,0
8815,this is a total piece of crap it is an insult to the awesome book by frank herbert they have mangled the story and characters the acting is average to bad the only character done right and played well is duke leto played by william hurt unfortunately he dies pretty early in the story and then its all downhill from there not that its a very tall hill to begin with the 1984 movie was directed by the legendary david lynch i was not overly impressed with the movie but considering the technological limitations of the time they tried their best amazingly the crappy mini series makes it look so much better by comparison it was at least somewhat true to the book which i really love they had the chance to do it right this time sadly it was not taken,0
1296,carlos mencia just plain isn t funny his show is painful to watch because of that his sketches parodies are all very horrible and this really just feels like a filler for the chapelle show which while i m not a big fan of that it is much funnier than this trash carlos mencia gives the stupid speeches and he all too often depends on finishing his monologues with a retarded voice and going der der der it s just not funny he often when talking to others makes puns they are horrible and painful when people don t laugh he blames them why would anyone laugh he s not funny he has an immature sense of humor in everything he does on this show it s amazing that anyone but 3 year olds watch this one of my least favorite things he does is water down every topic and make it seem like a joke i hope that this racist idiot gets taken off the air as soon as possible because he s dumbing down a station that doesn t need to be dumbed down anymore,0
23700,perhaps many viewers who got frustrated by this film live their lives without ever thinking deeply about life itself what i want to point out here is that distant is not only an art house film but one of the best art house films from all the art house films i have seen distant is the one that really stands out as a glittering piece of gold it is even fair to say that this film s cinematography and depiction of human emotion surpass tarkovsky s nostalgia one commentator got it right that sex a jaded common feature among foreign films is surprisingly lacking in distant and in a good way what is most remarkable about distant is that it captures the details of life we usually ignore and the rich essence of our existence that often gets buried under the din and visual extravaganza of our commercialized world fortunately distant doesn t have that much to spare the audiences and what we see on the screen is a bare portrait of human beings,1
4748,i do not see what is the whole deal about this movie patricia kaas sings yes and that makes the film charming but singing is not enough i mean if you want to get all benefits of this one go buy patricia s cd and enjoy the plot is simple if to omit the dreams the main characters seem to love each other instantly and as well instantly forget their other acquaintances relationships appear almost mandatory and the little detective story thrown in just makes things worse what at first appeared to be a perfect movie ending is first screwed up and then comes out as just a dream i measure movies by how well i would remember them and for this one i already started to forget the details,0
10015,you could have put the characters on the island for any reason at all and had the same movie the first one had an original story the second stole one from king kong and in the end i hope of this trilogy the story seemed to have been bypassed altogether drop some people on an island full of dinosaurs and watch them run for their lives that was about all there was to it the special effects were decent but not worth 8 dollars if you have a discount theatre in your local area wait and see it for a buck i wouldn t even bother renting it that would be too much money for this unthrilling thriller,0
13652,an untidy man known as bill lives in a small dreary flat with a poster of marilyn monroe on the wall and his typewriter for company only the man can t think of anything to write he wanders around the streets following people just to see where they go maybe this will give him some inspiration to write he begins to follow a well dressed man holding a bag he follows him for a few days while in a cafe the well dressed man sits down at a table on the opposite side of bill and inquires why bill is following him the well dressed man says his name is cobb cobb then surprisingly informs bill that he is a burglar and even starts to take bill with him into houses to steal things although cobb insists he doesn t go into other people s homes to just steal he says he likes to let people know he has been there and interrupted the things they take for granted he puts knickers from another burglary into a man s trousers for example the film is told in flashbacks at times too the director used this technique in greater abundance in his recent feature memento bill eventually decides to cut his hair and dress in a suit on the advice of cobb he meets a blonde lady in a club who used to date the owner a bald man who is very dangerous she says we see a scene where a hammer is used by the bald man s hence men on a man s fingers in the blonde lady s flat these are some of the many pieces of the puzzle that the director shows us and they will all fit into place when we arrive at the surprising conclusion,1
8392,i realize the line on my summary is not too polite this film written directed by scott caan starring giovanni ribisi don cheadle himself runs a long 88 minutes there is a dog in this puppy of a movie he is cute the movie opened in 2 u s theatres in late april 2007 for one week grossed all of 914 it quickly went to dvd in early august 2007 we were only able to take about 40 minutes before we turned the dvd off this was the type of movie that played on lower half of double bill you saw the main film figured lets see what this one is like you might have walked out before we shut it off the 3 actors the young ladies in the film all have done deserve better than this ratings out of 4 54 points out of 100 imdb 4 out of 10,0
9580,i would like to know the real name of the lodge where scenes from the movie were filmed it is truly beautiful and hearkens back to 20 s and 30 s architecture like the hotel del coronado i know it was on either big bear lake or lake arrowhead and would like to hear if it is still in existence as for the movie itself it is truly amazing that jane wyman was even nominated for an academy award this must have been a period when she was well liked by her academy peers it really would have been interesting to get a true impression from wyman and the other actors in this movie regarding the script the script of this movie like the recent kevin costner movie with a message in a bottle is so unbelievable that it it limits the credibility that the actors can bring to their parts rock hudson can be forgiven he was never a great actor was able to get by mostly on his looks and didn t get credible roles until later in his career pretty maids is the exception but wyman must have been forced to take this movie through contractual requirements or the studio system,0

2204,okay if you discount the production value the ugly outfits and the big hair this adaptation is still far inferior to the 90 s version first ann firbank playing anne elliot is literally ten years too old to play this role and her acting leaves much to be desired amanda root playing the same role in the 90 s version can express more in her big brown eyes than firbank can with her entire face in a four hour production anne is turned into a peevish whining boring character and what was with the scene during the long walk where she stops to spout off poetry henrietta and louisa looked so much alike that the only time i could tell them apart was when they stood next to each other henrietta was taller and louisa never was there a more obnoxious character it was ridiculous to think that wentworth was supposed to be interested in her she is supposed to be high spirited and pretty and charming not stupid and silly with her ridiculous laugh that s like nails on a chalkboard when she starts to chant to lyme to lyme to lyme i started yelling shut up shut up shut up the best part of the movie was when louisa falls those three feet at the cobb because i knew i wouldn t have to see her anymore in the movie speaking of the fall at the cobb scene it was the mose poorly acted badly directed and edited scene of the entire film how does a person fall three feet down land on her feet and still be knocked unconscious on the plus size the character of elizabeth was much closer to the book than in the 90 s version they also put in many more scenes with anne and frederick at the end i ll admit i have bought this movie even though i knew how sub par it was but i m a huge austen fan so i ll buy any movie adapted from one of her novels watch this move if you re morbidly curious or to appreciate the 90 s version even more the bottom line is this version may follow the letter of the novel but the 90 s version follows the spirit,0
12825,i have lost count as to how many times i have watched this movie i ve never grown tired of it since this is a movie that can be enjoyed and interpreted on so many levels they just don t make movies like this anymore after recently finally watching the riveting documentary on the making of this film hearts of darkness a filmmakers journey into madness i m even more amazed that this film even got finished yet alone turn out so great the fact that they actually filmed this movie in the jungles of the phillipines is the film s greatest asset you actually feel like your in vietnam all of the actors are fantastic with my favorites still being robert duvall i love the smell of napalm in the morning martin sheen and the great marlon brando a lot of people complain that the film gets too murky weird and cerebral near the end well remeber what coppolla said about this movie this film is not about vietnam it is vietnam what he means is that this film is about madness and not the war this movie is based on the short story heart of darkness by joseph conrad and is set against the vietnam war instead of the civil war as in the book i think that was a brilliant combination in my opinion this is perfect challenging film that is dark violent humorous at times and well done in every single possible way a true classicrating 10,1
7483,what garbage is there actually no part ii if this movie actually ends the way it did everyone involved with this movie should be ashamed this movie is nothing close to a movie like outbreak which was actually a fairly decent movie this movie was rushed in hopes of being able to gain a few easy dollars i started watching the movie under the assumption that it would be bad but i never imagined it would be this bad this movie was nothing more then a way to exploit the fears of the american people for profit if you have not seen this movie don t bother movie is full of poorly developed characters and poor acting i really hope the production of this movie was only a couple of weeks stay away don t be fooled by the hype,0
20227,suzumiya haruhi no y utsu the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya might at a first glance make you think that this is just another animated school comedy drama well it s not the setting just happen to be a school environment this is a comedy alright but a very smart one with a lot of sarcasm and the characters does have a psychological sublimeness which is almost in the same class that can be found in the works of ingmar bergman the episodes is aired as it seems out of order i e the pilot is in fact episode 11 this makes it possible to present small clues to upcoming episodes the show is an adaption of nagaru tanigawa s popular novel series about haruhi suzumiya what about the story then like in all the episodes does the story revolves haruhi suzumiya who tries to ease her own boredom by embarking in adventures haruhi her self has no interest in ordinary humans and actively searches for aliens time travelers and espers persons with supernatural forces to find this sort of people she has formed a club which she calls the sos brigade save the world by overloading it with fun haruhi suzumiyas brigade except for haruhi the other members of the sos brigade is kyon he is the real protagonist of the show it s trough his point of view that we follow the story he just happen to sit in front in class when haruhi came up with the idea to form the sos brigade he is quite sceptical to most club activities and tags along just to ensure that haruhi don t go to much to the extremes and he is the only one in the class that haruhi likes to talk with another member is yuki nagato which is the indispensable silent member and is also the only remaining member of the literature club which room the sos brigade has occupied in the quest for a free club room she doesn t mind that the sos brigade uses her clubroom as long as she can sit in a corner and read her books she also participate in the brigades activities mikuru asahina was voluntarily arrested by haruhi because the club needed a lolita like mascot for anything suspicious to happen she often act as the clubs maid the last member is the always smiling itsuki koizumi who happens to be the mysterious transfer student meaning he transfered two months in to the semester which haruhi finds to qualifies as mysterious haruhi thinks that all members but kyon are some random picked people in school but the do indeed have their own interest in her,1
18755,nothing short of magnificent photography cinematography in this film the fact that you keep seeking and hoping for more flying sequences tells you that they have just enough the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see don t be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy10 10,1
14287,after seeing naked city and night and the city which is still my favorite dassin i was more than excited to watch his masterpiece o word criterion rififi now i am a little bit disappointed about the story so i have at least these five questions in my mind 1 in the final countdown louis grutter shot from the inside a house the main character tony le st phanois he couldn t know if he is still alive or not but he didn t care about it and ran directly after it outside the house with the money to reach his car so of course tony wasn t dead and shot him big questionmark 2 in another important scene the specialist in safes cesar gave directly after the robbery as a present a diamond ring which was a part of the robbery a woman which was working for louis grutter in a night bar stupid because before this character wasn t that stupid and of course louis knew directly that tony planned the jewel robbery small questionmark 3 after the gangsters behind louis grutter murder mario ferrati and his wife tony and his best friend joe planned a revenge against louis gang at the same time they don t care for the security of joe s wife and his five years old child of course louis gang kidnapped the son cheap and simple 4 the perfect heist of course this is the best 30min long scene in the whole plot without any word spoken in the whole time but was this a perfect heist comparing with other movies which handle with this theme i could only smile when for example tony was taken a fire extinguisher to banned the alarm also too simple 5 the grutter gang went to the house of mario because they knew however the jewels will be there then they murder mario and his wife and then they are not searching for it no they ran directly out of the apartment and more they not observing the apartment after it so tony can go after a while which was the same day inside to take the jewels big questionmark over all it s a good movie because of the brilliant 30min silent heist scene because of the very good cut the end scene in the car through paris is stunning because of a very good actor called jean servais because of this black white fever you will get while watching it because of some other reasons too other user wrote about but please don t tell me this is a stunning story,1
18518,though several scenes of wirey spindell can be described as over the top i thought that it was refreshing to see something that was willing to go to a level of near taboo twisted comedy wirey spindell is a great film with great dialog i wouldn t say that this film is for everyone but the film is on my top 10 list if you can look beyond it s occasional offensiveness and watch it for the film that it is i would hope you could see it in the same light that i do,1
18090,this is a fun movie with subtle intention its off beat comedy is hilarious to me unfunny to my friends the soundtrack is perfect i own this on vhs and i have watched it many many times because it s simply a fun and funny love story with great performances by all the principals though using joan cusack solely as a perch for big hair was a waste of her talent i know i know she was still young on a sad note i decided to check out the dvd last night instead of watching my vhs tape and was shocked to find many crucial scenes cut and on the copy i watched there was no special feature of deleted scenes it was as if the deleted scenes never existed i am so glad i bought the used vhs at a flea market it is clear there was a great deal of choreography in this which is another reason i love it so much it takes great skill talent and genius to move around the scenes like mercedes ruehl dean stockwell and matthew modine do from scene to scene note the scene when the grocery carts converge the rolling on the floor during the shoot out in miami the chicken lickin debacle the foot massage the salon hair washing there is a very theatrical feel to this film which may be the turn off for so many whose poor reviews follow i know some viewers who don t quite understand this style mistake the exaggerations and over the top performances for poor acting and worse direction not so jonathan demme does a great job bringing to life the entire company and their respective roles the opening credits and first scene rank among my all time favorites as well another favorite opening credits first scene fly away home too bad matthew modine so ardently skipped out of the public eye i really like him and found his casting perfect in the role of mike smith actually this film is well cast from soup to nuts everyone is believable and true to his role as for the question of expecting audience to accept pfeiffer and stockwell as italians why not i thought they pulled it off perfectly well charming fun exciting what is there not to like if you want a little fun watch this quirky colorful adventure mob love story if you are looking to learn more about organized crime and families tune to hbo s the sopranos,1
18215,when i read the synopsis 3 people lost in the wild battling against a huge crocodile i wasn t exactly drawn in it sounded like the typical yawn movie horror formula of a bunch of people stalked by a monster except in this case there are only three of them so we wouldn t even get the macabre joy of watching them get picked off one by one however i watched it couldn t sleep nothing else to do and it turned out to be much better than expected the acting is great the atmosphere tense and you really get that rare sense of a low budget winner horror as it should be done first rate film making it s not perfect but it s well worth seeing i give it a 7,1
15175,i suppose this is what is called southern gothic it stars samuel l jackson christina ricci and also justin timberlake is featured in a role timberlake does good work much to my surprise i didn t expect it of him when you re lost and you can t find your way home that s the black snake moan the people in this movie are definitely lost in many ways psychologically and emotionally damaged betrayed by those they trusted and loved and filled with a lot of pain samuel l jackson plays a blues singer musician whose wife has messed around with his brother and now left him for his brother along with aborting a child he had hoped to have with her christina ricci s character is a woman who was sexually abused when young this has turned her into a self destructive nymphomaniac allowing men to treat her badly the story lies in the intersection of these two characters lives it is a love story but not a sexual love story between them the older black man and the young white woman it is different from most films hollywood grinds out i highly recommend it 10 stars,1
23916,i get the feeling that lisa krueger is easy to overlook i personally found her first film 1996 s manny and lo to be a wonderfully detailed character study and the performances were uniformly wonderful with special credit to mary kay place the film played for a week or two in major urban centers and vanished one or two critics really liked it but many viewed it as slight krueger s second film committed was released this year 2000 after nearly two years of delays and it similarly vanished and once again critics dismissed the film as slight and pushed the film aside at most praising heather graham s screen presence but rarely her acting ability and once again for me committed is a solid success i feel as if krueger has a genuine voice and a personal visual style and these are traits that shouldn t be so easily ignored simply because she works on a very restrained canvass the title has several meanings but mostly it refers to joline graham s refusal to let her husband carl luke wilson flake out and leave her she follows him from new york to el paso and becomes one of the most appealing stalkers in recent cinematic history her respect for her marriage vows leads her to mexican mysticism and self discovery and yep the plot is just that simple and thus just that easy to ignore joline of course is the crying voice of a generation whose parents divorced at a rate nearing fifty percent and for me her personal revolution against broken promises and a legacy of deceit is fairly intelligent and powerful confident in the belief that people just don t have enough faith in each other joline inevitably has to discover that her beliefs aren t in synche with those of society at large several comments her have referred to her character as one dimensional and i m afraid that that s a simplistic reading of the film or perhaps even a misreading if joline were just an innocent she wouldn t be interesting at all it s the fact that she understands the world and refuses to play by the rules of the normals that makes her so interesting sociologically she s a complete deviant krueger sometimes falls into moments of cutesy dialogue and her direction of this film has a rather odd over reliance on shots of clouds moving across the el paso skyline however her mistakes are fairly rare and in this film as in manny and lo it s the performances that carry the day graham has never been better because she s never had a character as perfectly tailored to her as joline for the first time in her career graham seems comfortable playing an adult even one in slightly arrested development she carries the film perfectly luke wilson and casey affleck as joline s brother both have a number of fine moments as do alfonso arau as a mexican mystic and mark ruffalo and t bo the slightly psychotic truck driver as in manny and lo the characters are part of their environments well detailed totally organic creations these characters may sometimes seem pointlessly quirky but they make sense in their context even goran visnjic as an artist turned on by joline s devotion fits in in some strange way even though his character s foreigness is never discussed for me this is a movie that gains depth looking back another commenter here spoke of the stereotypical mexican portrayals and again i m tempted to call that a misreading joline is looking for self justification she knows that her commitment is out of control but she s looking for any spiritual avenue that can help her make sense of herself arau s character understands that most people don t believe in him and he plays up his own faith when he sees a woman who respects him i guess i can understand how this movie could be viewed as underwhelming i d simply disagree it s consistently funny frequently hilarious and all of the characters exude a warmth which is quite wonderful i m giving this one a 7 5 10 and when i log in the vote here that ll go up to an 8,1
13524,got back from morocco then where my dad was attached to the german embassy when the film came out in europe took all my girlfriends to see it show them the beauty of the country where jimi had played and stayed where the hippies stopped after leaving ibiza and before joining goa sean combs just celebrated at a friends restaurant in marrakech recently the djema el fna was much wilder in those days than it is now the stones went there earlier brian recorded in tangiers so it s memories and family entertainment and i m glad my son will get to know about the north of africa watching this movie candice bergen looks beautiful and oo7 connery is pretty funny indeed and teddy roosevelt as played by brian keith quite impressive,1
24884,easily one of my three or four favorite films definitely one for the desert island there is nothing brilliant about this film rather it glows warm and welcoming the audience is invited to a party and like any good party the joy comes in the interaction of the guests and what you learn as you progress from one to the next with apologies to joyce the film s title conjures up a number of ideas that keep audiences away the film is not horrifying it is not depressing it is a beautiful look into a time that has past within which people are growing up and others are winding down some are frustrated and others are serene and all around ever present throughout the evening are the people and the parts of people that have been laid to rest the words these exquisite actors are given to speak are perfection and set to the music of the irish brogue are an auditory feast particularly to us flat toned americans about the lack of brilliance i referred to above i take it back there is no other word to describe the final scene between anjelica huston and donal mccann it speaks quiet volumes about well everything some lovely snowy evening rent this film and just let it happen before you no gunfights no car chases no dinosaurs just film at its most sublime,1
13808,i was trying to work out why i enjoyed this film its not because of money spent on it that s for sure did i see a painted water pistol in there maybe they don t have the same sort of visual effects houses in the scotland or maybe they just didn t have any money the making of clearly shows a gang of very plucky guys making a movie against the odds awesome but what i really liked was the grit of the performances mike michell and patrick white play the lead parts like 2 normal guys no hollywood histrionics here ok so the effects work isn t very good the spaceships just don t look as good as they should in todays fx world and i ve seen much better free stuff on youtube but the film holds together very well once they get to the planet was this filmed in scotland or just by a scottish crew or is it just better effects work did they edit out the water by the end i kinda loved this film and was disappointed when they all died,1
21208,my main criticism is quite simply that it isn t long enough or detailed enough i would have loved to see more of everything the building of the vessel the engineering the training the first lift to orbit preparations for departure venus orbital injection everything i would have liked to see more of the first leg venus to earth instead of zipping there like a n 10 corporation bus in fact i would have liked to see a series on the scale of earth story made of this with a full hour dedicated to every planet and maybe another to the loop around the sun as it was i was left hungry on the other hand i do understand budgets and viewers attention spans re the science let s be fair about the speed of light time lag they did mention at the beginning that there was a lag in conversations but they let this evaporate once they reached the outer planets some kind of conversation had to be presented to the viewers and we have to assume that the lag was edited out for the sake of palatability so no complaints there but zero for noisy spaceships the only film in which spaceships make no noise was kubrick s 2001 and even then he copped out by using the noise of the crew breathing in their helmets which was pretty effective i wish the makers of space odyssey had realized just how eerie the sight of vast rocket motors blasting in absolute silence might be but alas pegasus lets out much the same roar as every other cardboard spaceship in every other cardboard scifi film but the rest of the science was excellent no complaints there in fact praise for bringing out the radiation problems as well as they did i just hope that having done this film won t discourage the bbc from making a really detailed version but i suppose that s not for next week or next year either,1
9576,i really don t know much about the marquis de sade not having read any of his book but i never imagined him as a flaming queen carson kressley of queer eye for the straight guy or jack from will and grace would have fit easily into the role that nick mancuso gave us the movie itself was rather thin and seemed more of a parody or an excuse to show the paris whorehouse several times with men and women having a good time on the couches in the parlor what they can t afford a room i did find it cute that the madame irina malysheva felt she was doing her patriotic duty taking care of the soldier s needs the movie was just an excuse to show a lot of breasts and i mean a lot fans of gimli john rhys davies might be interested in seeing him in a different role as inspector marais,0
11774,this film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen the writer obviously bought the playbook how to write a space disaster movie and followed it play by play in particular the stereo typical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space putting on a brave show in the face of disaster has been done time and time again max q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw 50 million at the project but judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects the producers could only muster 50 thousand to learn that the film was nominated for a special visual effects emmy has me absolutely gob smacked i think a handful of high school students with a pass in media studies could have created more believable effects and the plot holes are too numerous to mention but i will pick one out as an example now i m no nasa expert but surely it s highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pear shaped with the program surely there is someone more experienced at mission control who the program director would call on rather than a twenty nine year old who has not been in the control room before the only saving grace for this film is the work of bill campbell he manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script i give this film 2 out of 10 with the above average work of bill campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark,0
22245,this is not a real james cagney vehicle since his screen time is unusually slim frankie darro plays tough kid jimmy smith the leader of a gang of street thugs that is sent to reform school with a few of his hoodlum friends cagney plays patsy gargan a gang leader himself who is given a token position as a deputy commissioner when he finds out first hand of the brutal treatment dished out at the reform school he is compelled to make some major changes with the help of the reformatory nurse madge evans the mayor of hell is fast paced and is still entertaining after all these years the cast is well rounded featuring dudley digges arthur bryon farina hoskins g pat collins and allen jenkins,1
13638,i saw this series on pbs in 1980 in college and i still can t get it out of my head although i have never seen it since i remember every cast member the casting was perfect as mentioned in other comments the design the lighting and of course the story which is by itself is enough to keep you glued to the set probably the best tv series i ever saw next to the original roots,1
17174,here s another pleasant surprise whenever i hear a movie is being remade i cringe movies such as gone in sixty seconds and the day of the jackal get remade and the results are less than stellar so when i heard that the italian job was getting remade i expected it to be bad well i had the opportunity to calm down read some reviews and finally see the movie and was proven wrong granted it s not original and predictable but it s sure fun from beginning to end you are taken on one very fun ride the scenes with the minis are great and the characters actually enjoy themselves so even if there are some flaws who cares as long as it s fun overall 8 out of 10 the only points lost are maybe the a few details and a slight lack of realism but you ll be having so much fun you won t even be given a chance to stop and notice,1
20040,i really love this movie i haven t played final fantasy vii but i still loved the movie its really funny and i love the job the voice over actors have done the visuals are so fantastic and all the lines are so well done i have to admit i have a pretty good imagination so i was able to fill most of the gaps the movie presented and i suggest you watch it twice because lots of things suddenly make sense also this is pretty funny you should watch it with the subtitles on because what they say and what the subs say are sometimes completely different its really usually pretty funny but sometimes it helps u to understand what they say better watch it love marnie,1
12436,there are certain horror directors for whom i ve built up so much respect admiration over the years that they can t possibly disappoint me know matter what garbage to decide to put on film lucio fulci is surely one of them but damned he s trying to disappoint me with his later efforts you can easily afford yourself to skip most of the films fulci directed or produced during the late 80 s and simply watch cat in the brain instead because that one title gathers and repeats the best and absolute goriest footage of no less than seven other fulci flicks including the sickest murders sequences featuring in when alice broke the mirror as a whole this movie definitely ranks among our director s weakest and most pointless achievements the script is incoherent as hell the basic premise is totally implausible and somewhat stupid and there s absolutely no suspense to enjoy i love the title but it s actually quite meaningless there is a character named alice in the story but it s only a supportive role and she certainly doesn t break any mirrors i suppose she could break stuff simply using her voice as she s an opera singer but she doesn t the plot revolves on a middle aged and gambling addicted playboy who spends his days seducing wealthy widows and killing them for their money lester parson butchers the ladies as well as unwelcome witnesses in gruesome ways makes steaks out of their juiciest body parts and feeds the remainders to his cat there s also a silly psychological sub plot in which he thinks his own shadow is responsible for the murders instead of him the difference between when alice broke the mirror and some of fulci s greatest horror films the beyond city of the living dead lies in the fact that he totally doesn t bother to create a horrific atmosphere the characters lester included are colorless and boring and the murders are ordinarily depicted like it s the most common thing in the world to put a woman s head in a microwave or repeatedly run back and forth over a human body with a car the lighting is poor the cinematography super ugly the editing clumsy and amateurish and the acting performances are downright miserable if i didn t know any better i would think lucio deliberately made a lousy film in order to protest against all the harsh critics that dislike his repertoire no matter how much spirit and effort he put into it the obvious element to enjoy here is simply the outrageous gore bloodshed because even the attempt to blend in black comedy doesn t work properly as long as lester swings around his chainsaw and cuts off women s feet when alice broke the mirror is an undemanding piece of horror entertainment but other than that there s isn t a whole lot to recommend,0
1619,i watched this film awhile ago and the only thing i can remember about the film is how absolutely horribly outstandingly bad it was its definitely in my top 5 worst films i have ever seen and to think i had to persuade my mates to get this film out at the video shop my reputation has been shot to bits because of this film will my mates ever trust me again i doubt it they always say don t judge something by its cover they were right when i saw the cover to skins gang boys i thought wow this looks great as it had a load of skin heads on the front cover running riot with metal bars don t watch this film i can t think of anything else to say the acting is bad the story is bad its just bad,0
4146,what can be said about this truly one of the most mind numbing experiences of my life your brain will attempt to shut down as part of a primal impulse of self preservation i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way i mean this in a terrible way a terrible way this film has no redeeming features everything is appalling artless camera work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable i e lots of corn lots of mud the story is beyond stupid the script is was there a script the villain is severely unscary and wears yellow wellington boots the kids are annoying the lead man is charisma free and it has the audacity to go on for 100 minutes utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture normally such a statement would be an exaggeration meant for comical effect not in this case i ll even say it again this is torture at the end i was in a state of paralysis this was brief thankfully but once i recovered i decided i had to watch the making of featurette i had to understand maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity was it all an elaborate joke i watched the first 2 minutes of the making of featurette and discovered that the writer director was to put it mildly somewhat misguided i also discovered that because i had taken time out to watch the first two minutes of the making of featurette of dark harvest 2 that i was an idiot not a pleasant voyage of self discovery life sucks highly unrecommended,0
12183,this film follows a very similar storyboard to the warriors only with less intensity and rather poor acting which is nothing to write home about the story in general is not that bad based around a small aussie gang who are trying to get out of the city when one of their members is framed for the rape of another gang s girl they then have to fight their way through the streets whilst they are been hunted down by a number of rival gangs on could assume that the writers have taken a page out of the warriors book and re written it but as mentioned above with not nearly as much intensity the acting as a whole is not very good in my opinion and it s clearly obvious on many occasions that they are indeed acting the fight scenes make up for this however but then the poor sound effects that go with them bring it back down this film has nothing on once were warriors low budget alright story poor acting nothing to write home about,0
14872,i just finished watching this last weekend and found it absolutely hillarious some of the scenes i just couldn t stop laughing at dennis is soooo amazingly thick sometimes and just says the stoopidest things but at the same time he s just being cool to impress his girlfriend who gets arrested anyway the beach scenery is very tranquil until along comes robbie coltrane not the greatest movie ever made but certainly something to think about renting on a saturday night when you haven t got much else to do like i did you might need to hunt around for it though i was lucky as my local video store stocks it,1
6944,this is very much overrated i guess it carries some nostalgic value for many people it has its moments but every scene is heavily overacted and the plot is quite shallow with this cast it could have been much better,0
24064,what do you do if you re aishwarya rai coming off of a blockbuster film like devdas with some skeptical critics still relentlessly unsatisfied with your astounding performance or convinced by your strong screen presence and stellar acting skills what do you do go home sit down and pout no if you re aishwarya rai you sign yourself up for the next strong period piece that comes along and continue to prove yourself worthy of all the praise kudos great scripts and equally great roles and that s just what she did with and in chokher bali a passion play where she stars and shines as binodini a young widow who causes controversy way ahead of her time directed by rituparno ghosh who later goes on to direct her in the equally stellar raincoat prasenjit chatterjee devdas in bengali costars,1
1409,an updated version of a theme which has been done before while that in and of itself is not bad this movie doesn t reach the ring like the other inherent and pure evil ones do predictable ambitious attempt that falls short of the mark not worth sitting through for the tired contrived ending,0
8319,it s schmaltzy but then what else did you expect the heroine is cinderella s younger sister complete with wicked mother sister and brother in law the hero if you can call him that is an ineffectual putz and the rival love interests are full of melodramatic villainy the cast settings and wardrobe were all very attractive and i thought the actors did a superb job considering how weak the material was the movie was prettily filmed and boasted a soundtrack that was carefully crafted to cue the viewer about what emotions he should be experiencing throughout megon mcdonough sang sweetly and provided the film with some of its best moments if you love danielle steel you will love this film if you love archetypal romance you will love this film i did not i was able to sit through it but it was close,0
18080,i have watched farscape from first episode to now and i will continue to watch it the setting and the characters are amazing and the plots are great the show really keeps me on the edge of my seat and when the show goes off after an hour i keep hoping it will be another hour,1
1062,if you described any of the scenes nightmares of children murdering you in your sleep your infant daughter talking to ghosts searching for your lost child in an abandoned mine at night so petrified with fear that you can t move even though the blood from a murder victim is dripping onto you from the floor above then i d say you had a horror movie but some how wicked little things just wasn t scary i am a horror fan and i loved the location the plot in principal and i liked the three leading ladies i didn t want to see them come to harm i wanted the bad guy to get his just desserts the rest of the cast are always simply cannon fodder so i was indifferent either way with them and it played out every clich in the book even down to the torch battery running out in the pitch dark just as you start to here whispering voices closing in on you i would still recommend that you watch it but unless you are new to horror movies or under 12 years you will have seen it all before,0
7555,the real star of the last of the airport films is that big supersonic carrier the french created called the concorde if you bear in mind that the whole film is dedicated to showing what that needle nosed plane could do in the sky than the whole film kind of makes sense but if you re expecting some serious drama here than by all means take some of the evasive action the concorde shows here when some nasty folks try to shoot her down susan blakely plays a television news reporter who also happens to be the mistress of military industrial tycoon robert wagner one of wagner s aides just happens to bring her information on some of wagner s dirty business dealings selling arms to folks not friendly to the usa when the source macon mccalman is killed in front of her and she s nearly done in by a hit man whom she escapes from of course she confronts wagner with the information and of course he denies it but right before blakely boards the concorde mccalman s widow kathleen maguire hands her the necessary documents but on the way to moscow with a stop in paris wagner and his minions try to put the big bird down but the fearless crew of alain delon david warner and george kennedy is up to all their tricks it s quite a bag full as you ll see if you want to watch the film if you re an aviation enthusiast you absolutely won t care about the plot it s like the film le mans with steve mcqueen which has a legion of auto racing fans who have made it a cult item maybe le mans is better at that because they just didn t bother with any kind of story among the passengers is a pot smoking saxophonist played by jimmie walker a distraught mother accompanying a new heart for her child played by cicely tyson and martha raye a woman with a weak bladder who spends the entire trip from washington to paris in the loo she s actually the best one here robert wagner must have been psychic though because i m sure on the strength of this film he got the part of doctor evil s number two in the austin powers series i m sure all concerned got a big pay day out of this film but it seems to have killed the airport saga of movies,0
12806,when i stepped into the theater i thought this was going to be a great movie and i was not disappointed one bit wow this movie is brilliant the emotions felt through out the whole movie are extraordinary great acting by madhavan and simran beautiful music by a r rahman this might most probably be the best tamil movie i ve seen in ages mani ratnam has yet again proved that he is the best in making meaningful and heartfelt movies this movie is basically about a young girl p s keerthana who is in search of her biological mother nandita das who abandoned her in a refugee camp to fight for her country just like her husband j d chakravathy a young novelist madhavan finds out about this young girl s story and decides to write a story about her he and his wife simran decide to adopt this young child but one day she finds out that they are not her real parents and decides to search for her biological mother this movie really screams excellent the way mani ratnam presented the movie is magnificent my rating 10 10,1
21786,a refreshing interview with the legendary italian cinematographer producer director who passed away in 1999 with close to 200 features to his credit as director a large portion is spent on d amato s softcore sex films including his notorious emanuelle entries with laura gemser they also briefly cover his porn career which kept him afloat during his last decade or so more interesting to me is the section focusing on his horror and action efforts d amato has plenty of great anecdotes about actors and his low budget film making including a story about an assistant accidentally collecting real bones amid the fake ones while shooting in a 2 000 year old catacomb other interviewees include george eastman and al cliver i would have liked a bit more conversation about his stateside filmirage productions not a single question about troll 2 granted it wasn t the cult film then it was now,1
17661,simply the best and most realistic movie about world war ii i ve ever seen not only because the german soldiers talk german and russian soldiers talk russian no english in a german or russian dialect also because of the realistic decor in which the movie was shot the acting is outstanding no hollywood sentiment at all even no love story stalingrad was supposed to be one of the most horrific battles during the war and in such context there s no place for sentiment or romantic scenes what you get is a movie which will make you thrill to the bone and which have one of the best unhappy endings a movie could have,1
659,this movie started off well enough sticking to the mood of the book fairly well even if the acting was not top notch the soundtrack was torturously bad saxaphone and electric guitars it was gratingly incongruous the female singer was positively dreary in the second half of the film the story takes a decidedly darker turn too dark for austen northanger abbey is made a dark and scary place whereas in the book it was disappointingly tame and modernized to catherine s eyes who in the heck is this marchioness with the ghastly makeup and wig a totally extraneous and unnecessary character one of the key elements in the book is the general is not a gothic monster like the characters in catherine s books his monstrosity is far more complicated in his oppression of his children s spirits and his treatment of catherine based on money concerns alone he does not lock up his wife or kill her but he does send miss morland on a 70 mile trip alone in a hired carriage with not enough money to pay her way home only her friend miss tilney s thoughtfulness in handing her some money on the way out the door saves her from being stranded this whole point gets seriously muddled in the film they make the general too dark from the outset peter firth should have not sung this part was painful to watch his depiction of tilney wasn t too bad but it was a shade dark in places henry tilney of the book made sport of miss morland s imagination on trip to northanger but he was never dark firth would have benefited from better direction the young lady who played isabella needed a better acting coach john thorpe was appropriately odious the striped waistcoat and coattails combo he wore was ghastly it certainly fit his character i think the film would have fared much better with a completely different soundtrack it cast an oppressive pall over the entire movie if i watch it again it will be with the sound off and subtitles on perhaps i would give the film a 4 then the sound quality of the dvd was quite poor the picture quality was not much better this is glaringly noticeable on a digital television when i think of what this film could have been i think of persuasion with amanda root and ciaran hinds,0
302,this movie was awful plain and simple the animation scenes had absolutely terrible graphics it was very clear to see that this film had about the budget of my grocery bill the acting was just as bad i ve seen better acting in pornographic films i would seriously like the hour and twenty minutes of my life back in fact i registered on imdb just so that other people don t get sucked into watching this like i did don t get me wrong though i love sci fi films this one seemed more like the intro to a video game i m glad i only spent a dollar to see this one the story line reminded me of the movie pitch black a prisoner on a ship in outer space escapes oh my goodness what are we gonna do i would not even let this play in the background of my house while i was cleaning bottom line here you can do better,0
15286,our family and friends enjoyed this movie very much the theme was well handled by the director with great performances from shabana azmi konkana sen and well supported by good performances from the other cast the climax was built well but for the ending which was a far from being called good we are still trying to understand what was the director trying to convey were they short of ideas or was the ending beyond the understanding of common movie lovers a better ending would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the viewer ship this however should not take away credit that is due to konkana and shabana azmi for relating so well with the characters,1
22415,dario argento is a filmmaker i m slowly getting into following the iconoclastic efforts of deep red and suspiria he s not a filmmaker to always care directly about silly things like plot that might be his one minor but for me apparent liability he won t let a little thing like common sense screw up his plan for his elaborate killing sequences as his killer s can go through any kind of elaborate set up of being invisible until revealing past the point of the pov tracking shots of said psychopathic killer but it s thrilling to see a filmmaker take chances like this anyway of a pure italian aesthetic making its way into the soul of a hitchcockian warp in fact as a note of interest if one has recently seen the scorsese short film where he took three pages of an un filmed hitchcock film which also took place in an opera argento had it beat by almost twenty years probably with no knowledge of the text it s also unabashedly 80s cd players and heavy metal and the hair oh my and with an absurdity that makes it all the more palatable to swallow the story is simple an opera of macbeth is being produced with high stylized pyrotechnics and trained ravens there s even a talented up and coming star replaced at the last minute betty played by marsillach but a murder occurs during the premiere interrupted not by that but by a falling light and now the killer is after betty she can t go to the police how can she let out that the opera is really cursed but will that matter in the face of a killer who won t let up one has probably seen premises like this played out in other argento films girl being chased by a killer but it s how argento like de palma constructs and executes his sequences and adds a distinctive flavor of his own to add touches of bizarre humor the breakout of the ravens to attack the killer and the subsequent version of pointing out in the lineup a kind of over stylization ala leone the bullet through the peephole through the door probably inspired a similar shot in kill bill 1 and even sado masochistic inspiration with the pins taped to betty s eyes more than once argento puts his actress through the wringer and she s all game for it even when things seem to just go into what the hell territory i was throwing up my hands almost saying i give up when she is led down the secret passage by the little girl as if suddenly we re in aliens now and through such dark genre material argento keeps the violence thick and fresh the suspense about as much as that with opera music coming right out of a speaker of a stereo system and a cinematographer who may have had a few drinks and rightfully so during some scenes the way they re shot and vibrate to a heart beat it should be considered trash but it s elevated past any limitations of the genre by the ballsy attitude of the director this in spite of a silly ending sillier than anything that preceded what came before it thanks little lizard and an attempt to break the macbeth curse which unfortunately didn t seem to happen in real life on the set of opera 8 5 10,1
20130,drew barrymore gets second chance at high school on undercover assignment as newspaper reporter in flashbacks we see that the first time around was to put it mildly a major disaster david arquette is amusing in modest role as drew s brother who also enrolls to help out sis lots of subplots endanger but never overwhelm simple charm of movie drew keeps making her niche as major innocent sexy light comic actress,1
11738,first there are some plot holes in this movie we see in the very beginning a kid dies from playing the game but who was tied up in the mail truck delivering the package which contains the game how did the driver place the package into the mailbox when he was lashed to the steering wheel it is not like he was mr fantastic wow that in just the first 15 minutes the actors are second rate take the bad guy played by patrick kilpatrick who exactly he has appeared in one episode of everything on tv and some secondary roles in poor movies like this one so most of the acting is like tv dramas i can live with that but the graphics or special effects are horrible the disembodied game voice sounds like a poor clone of hal from space oddessy 2000 what they called zombies looked more like shadows jumping around like monkeys from planet of the apes the aliens had transparent bodies like the shadow zombies in most cases the movie was just predictable as it had no hook or hidden agenda going the story was a good idea but like most good ideas discussed over lunch was never developed beyond that good idea stage,0
2739,someone should teach the people who made this movie that there is a difference between presenting multiple twists and screwing the audience over they even use hypnosis as a tool to cover up the plot holes whenever they can t find their way into or out of a scene they just say she is regressing to her past now or she s snapping out of it now and they think that explains everything this movie is a dishonest cheat and in the last 20 minutes becomes a full blown fiasco 1 2,0
23161,what can i say about kramer vs kramer on the surface it s rather simple but underneath it deals with emotions greater than life itself it delivers many fantastic moments it makes you laugh it makes you cry you sympathize with the characters and you care about them many films fail at this kramer vs kramer is a success i think everyone would agree the acting is superb once you watch kramer vs kramer for some time the acting in most other films starts to feel plastic and unemotional the actors seem to get along well with their roles and the characters really live on the screen there s some beautiful chemistry between them i think the best performance in the film comes from the young justin henry he s different from any other child actor i ve ever seen he s amazingly natural also there s some kind of neurotic beauty in meryl streep and dustin hoffman delivers one of the best performances of his career the story is very well written it s simple but complicated at the same time the concept is the simple part the feelings associated is the complicated part of it if you haven t seen this film yet you re definitely missing out see it now,1
14560,just watched this movie and it s not bad there are a few tense moments and not a lot of long dialog strings comes off as fairly intelligent fastpaced almost like documentary style this movie will evoke some nostalgia and a bit of cold war paranoia with cars street scenes and life in the 50 s the acting is fairly solid and at 85 minutes run time it goes by at a good pace an atomic era film buff shouldn t miss this one,1
10055,the filmmaker stayed true to the most accurate account of the story published in 1894 which includes an 1846 manuscript by richard williams bell son of john and lucy bell and younger brother of betsy bell titled our family trouble to knowledge this is the only eyewitness account ever penned the filmmaker should be credited for accuracy but there is little to say about the production and acting quality the acting was theatrical and the sound and picture quality was extremely poor it appears that the filmmaker simply shot scenes of the reported events that took place without incorporating or weaving them into a flowing plot or story line if you must know the story read about it its much more gripping and conclusive,0
19313,so the koreans are now knocking off american horror flicks but they are doing so with style doll master is a close copy of puppetmaster and dolls and even has a little child s play going for it several young adults are invited to attend a special event at a gallery filled with dolls only to find they are targets of a vengeful spirit the dolls come to life and do some pretty nasty things to the kids the gore level is reasonably high the photography and set design and production values are first rate the acting isn t all that bad and the scares are definitely there doll master may not be in the same league with a tale of two sisters or even dead friend but it s close give it a watch you won t be disappointed,1
11609,this was made in that beloved age known as the 80s and shot in my hometown of new york city actually this has become one of my favorite b sci fi movies oh sure it really stinks to high hell but there s so much to make fun of laugh and enjoy that it becomes more tolerable after every viewing such as try to find the similarities between this and well ok there is nothing similarly bad as this well except castle of fumanchu sock puppets can be dangerous to your healthcreate supense by describing through voice over rather than showing any imageryhave leading villainess valeria played wonderfully by angelika jager deliver some of the most riveting lines ever lots of men and women in post apocalyptic fashion aka leather bikinis loin cloths and dead animal fur do be horrified by the end i m off to have a salad toodles,0
7339,if you would have asked me 1 month ago how this movie was i probably would have left most of this out but i am a fan and as any fan i visit the movies sites often well when super troopers came out i visited that site after the release on dvd and was hooked yea it s a difficult site to stay on but the good ones normally are like good families they stick together what a story this company comedy troop has begging people to come and see there movies on street corners universities anywhere they can and all for free and after all that to develop a great fan base after a few years they crap on it and decide to close down there website that helped them and was created for the fans but the worst thing about it they didn t tell any of them they just decided that they are better than us they want new fans not the fans that helped them get where they are you know the same fans they begged years ago still the smart crew they are they released the best movie with super troopers and got everyones attention and thank god for that because after that they have sucked with everything else good for you guys way to go mainstream just remember when you realize your material isn t that good and you have no new fans left you are the ones who crapped the original ones away fans make you who you are not the other way around never burn your bridges,0
14549,first let me confess that i have not read this particular balzac novel so maybe i am directing my cavils unfairly at director and editor still my experience with balzac in other stories is that he writes as a realist not an obscurantist this is most certainly a film worth one s while but one is left sorely puzzled at the end was the colonel a fraud used by the lawyer for his own ends or for whose beyond himself or was the colonel not a fraud but used as aforesaid by the lawyer or did the lawyer truly try to serve the honest colonel the director and or the editor appear to me to have deliberately obscured these questions which doesn t seem like balzac the realist at the same time the film does an excellent job of delineating the characters if not their motives and the cast and production is superb that opening battlefield scene is bound to haunt one s dreams still one wonders at the all too common penchant among contemporary film makers to favor ambiguity above all else weren t the problems and motives of all these characters complicated enough for yves angelo,1
5463,this was so bad i want god to give me an extra two hours of life having had to sit through it first off the acting was uniformly bad there was barely a plot unless shaggy dog story with a guy in a rain poncho and skeleton mask instead of a dog counts the editing was was all over the place and the slow mo shots of the gore red corn syrup flying through the air doubtless flung using a spoon got irritating after the tenth time and infuriating after the hundredth time i like michael rooker he s done some good work this was not good this was less than good and by that i mean that it sucked hard for god s sake don t watch this movie,0
3876,harrison ford playing a playing a cop in a crime thriller the perfect ingredients it seems for top entertainment with harrison back to his indy and han solo best protecting a witness from ruthless and merciless murderers how easy it is to be fooled if the film concentrated on the main supposed themes of crime and suspense instead of putting up barns and shoving ice creams in peoples faces it possibly could have been more worthwhile unbelieveably predictable with the best method of despatching of a foe is with corn,0
600,in 1984 the karate kid had some charm to it even if it was little more than a poor man s rocky alas producer jerry weintraub failed to realize it was best to leave the story at the point where it had ended and convinced ralph macchio and pat morita to make an extra effort to turn the film into a trilogy part iii was the definitive low in the franchise yet someone must have thought the series still had some potential what other explanation could there possibly be for the existence of the next karate kid wait a minute next yep macchio s gone at least he was smart enough to stop eventually and his replacement is hilary swank playing a troubled teenager what else named julie pierce now the girl has family issues she also gets in trouble at school said school has a sadistic gym teacher michael ironside as it turns out though one of his students is actually a nice guy and julie falls for him this gets her in bigger trouble than before of course lucky for her she is currently living with mr miyagi morita an old friend of her grandfather who happens to know how to get back at the bad guys all those factors ad up to seven clich s and that s just a generic plot summary imagine what the detailed scenes must be like from beginning to end the next karate kid is a tired flat and dull marathon of idiotic lines and set ups swank does thankfully have the likes of boys don t cry and million dollar baby to redeem this disaster but why did morita accept to come back he may have received an oscar nomination for the first movie and was quite enjoyable in the sequels but has nothing to speak for him here even the revival of the wax on wax off gag is stillborn as for ironside he is slightly better than martin kove and thomas ian griffith in part iii but that s hardly a stretch so is this picture really that awful not exactly there is one sequence that manages to achieve a weird beauty but when the best bit in the whole film involves a group of asian monks dancing as they hear pop music for the first time in their lives it doesn t qualify as a recommendation to see the rest,0
20186,andaz apna apna is a movie that i treasure and its one movie i don t mind seeing at any time well almost any time this movie is simply marvelous and according to me is the funniest movie i ve ever seen and yes i do put it over hera pheri reason hera pheri has scenes you ll watch out but andaz apna apna not possible simply because every scene is a scene you got to watch out for aamir salman share great chemistry and are perfect in their shoes but i ll put the characters in order of favoritism rank 1 crime master gogo shakti kapoor s best performance till date and yes this happened before the casting couch gogo is an innocent character who belongs to well reputed family of mogambo mr india fame crime master gogo is actually mogambo s nephew but for mogambo he s more than a responsible handsome charismatic charming son gogo makes the biggest mistake of life by lending 36 000 rupees to teja who is as balla had once said a fraud and a cheat now gogo s only goal is to get back what s his and in his journey of recovering his lost money gogo realizes that there is more than 36 000 that he needs to achieve and thus begins gogo s struggle against the sinner world rank 2 teja teja main hoon mark idhar hai teja is an evil character who is ram gopal bajaj s twin originally named shyam gopal bajaj teja chooses to change his name to suit his personality teja as a child had always envied his brother and then one day things took a turn for the worse when his father gave his entire wealth to ram bajaj teja decided to kill his father but in the night s darkness instead killed munshi harish chandra raveena s dad though teja doesn t regret his actions teja s sole mission now is to get back his property somehow and start his own poultry bakery farm teja also needs to return back the loan to gogo but has no intentions whatsoever to do so in order to achieve his evil goals teja employs two people robert vijay khote who is very good at aiming and balla shahzad khan ajit s clone and son who is a very very smart boy rank 3 amar aamir khan wants to marry the rich heiress raveena so he sells his father s cheap saloon and heads off for mumbai amar has no problem taking care of the big business that raveena s father will hand him over after their wedding and is willing to sacrifice his happiness and shift to london if needed rank 4 prem salman khan after gogo prem is the second most innocent character to appear in the movie and the way amar tries to take advantage of him in the mask of a friend is tragic i won t reveal any more characters because jesus christ i just wouldn t stop typing the movie is outright stunning go and get the dvd now and beware of those cheap vcds as they have omitted many good scenes out of the movie the background music is stud and the action is better than the matrix especially the final encountered between prem and crime master gogo watch out for it it appears in the climax andaz apna apna is also a drama with many negative and positive characters and teach us a lot about life and values and ethics it teaches us about bravery why else would amar ask prem to stay back when they go to meet the kidnapper even though prem was complaining that he had to go to the toilet andaz apna apna is also a tragedy especially the scenes where salman is targeted by aamir and is given overdose of stomach upsetting pills the part where teja reveals his sad feelings regarding why he couldn t go to london and the part where gogo is arrested in the ending without even getting back his 36 000 andaz apna apna is overall a complete package sit back and enjoy the ride bet there ll be a second ride after that and then a third the movie was considered a flop back then and i bet no one liked it but buckle up guys this movie is a big hit even if it didn t have enough people coming to theatres the movie is one of the highest selling home dvds and one of the most frequently movie on most of the channels so the producers have laughed their way to the banks long time back,1

9347,a couple of clarifying comments are in order herschell gordon lewis contributed a brief introduction to the video release of doctor gore aka the body shop wherein he touched upon his collaborative efforts with j g pat patterson director and star of doctor gore patterson concocted the gore effects for the gruesome twosome and a few other lewis movies in the late 60s lewis remarks that whereas 2 000 maniacs was a five gallon film referring to the amount of stage blood required the lewis patterson productions were fifteen gallon pictures lewis does not describe doctor gore as a fifteen gallon film he s only talking about the films he patterson made together lewis has confessed elsewhere that his introduction to doctor gore was improvised before he d even seen patterson s film so take it with a grain of salt this may be an unfinished film but like some unfinished novels it does have an ending it s just missing some connective tissue patterson has definite stage presence a dry sense of humor helping to make this simplistic show somewhat more watchable than it should be there s an extremely bare bones plot even blood feast is more complex and a gratingly repetitive musical score by william girdler a bit of nudity lots of skin the entire middle section of the film involves the construction of a perfect woman this is concentrated gore for the bloodthirsty and laughable patterson the director is in way over his head but he tries hard to tell his story creatively if it s possible to use frankenstein clich s creatively but the best reason to see this film on something weird s dvd if possible is that it features a perfect nashville weeper bill hicks a heart dies every minute ain t it the truth,0
14277,rififi jules dassin france 1955 to me it seems a very risky idea to attempt a hollywood remake of jules dassin s 1955 classic rififi planned for release in 2007 al pacino apparently is gonna play the lead taking on the role of tony le stephanois risky business how they re gonna pull this off ironically dassin was blacklisted in hollywood and went on to try his luck in france and made this little masterpiece aptly called by some the grandddady of all caper and heist movies in my opinion it remains a one of a kind classic beautifully filmed with one of the most memorable endings ever to be put on film whatever one s opinion of the film in the last couple of years rififi has become dangerously overpraised nevertheless this french noir classic shouldn t be forgotten go see it before the remake is out there in order to have some ammunition for comparing the two camera obscura 9 10,1
15825,this film blew me away i thought i knew a little about the attica prison riot after watching this i see i knew nothing the story is told through the relationship between the attorney and the black inmate both the personal story of these two men and the unfolding courtroom drama were riveting the flashback sequences in the prison were awesome it s hard to believe it wasn t documentary footage it was so real it was not only a great piece of drama it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in american history i m with ebert and roeper i give it two thumbs up,1
6668,i know we shouldn t expect much from a low budget indie film but the idea behind it is sound an attempt to open america s eyes to the cozy relationship between the government and the journalists that are supposed to be keeping an eye out against it but somehow the documentary aspect of it takes away from its drama the protests during the 2004 republican convention in new york were not that compelling to make a documentary about it those kinds of compelling protests belong to the era of the 1960 s it would have been better to stick to a drama format perhaps a slow build up where the young journalist s eyes are gradually opened up to the conspiracy,0
19484,ghoulies 4 is pretty ghoulish sequel the ghoulies look very different from the first three ghoulies but there still cool there are some nice flash backs from ghoulies the first movie jonathan is back once again in this one he wasn t in parts 2 or 3 though the movie is low budget at times but fun to watch you ve got tony cox as the dark ghoulie and arturo gil as the light ghoulie the ghoulies in this movie are actually good guys instead of evil like in the first three movies both ghoulies are pretty funny characters in the movie then you ve got the very hot alexandra it s a great dark comedy and funny any fan of the ghoulies movies will enjoy watching ghoulies 4 the dvd is finally coming out this july 2007 hopefully one day ghoulies iii will be on dvd in the usa i d really like to see a sequel to this movie one day too i doubt it will happen though it s 2007 now and no sign of a sequel yet if there ever is a sequel i hope jim wynorski will make it i give ghoulies iv a 9 10,1
6190,relentless like one of those loud action movies the entire cast seems to be on speed i didn t quite get the director s intentions if any i wonder if she s ever seen a stanley donen vincent minnelli or even a george sidney musical structure please this is one hell of a mess and i loved abba the costumes the unflattering photography unflattering towards the actors but loving towards the locations the one thing that makes the whole thing bearable is the sight of meryl streep making a fool of herself no chemistry with her friends christine baranski and julie walters think of streep with lily tomlyn in the altman film and you ll understand what i was hoping for i was embarrassed in particular by pierce brosnam and colin firth the audience however seemed to enjoy it so it probably it s just me,0
14837,i just viewed eddie monroe and i was very impressed the story was easily paced as the plot unraveled to a surprise ending heartwarming performances action humor and drama filled the screen topnotch acting by some talented long islanders great script this is the best film that fred carpenter has made to date he should be very proud of this work doug brown s score is on the mark craig morris is the next tom cruise or brad pitt hard to believe this is a low budget independent film just imagine what carpenter can do with a hollywood level budget paul regina s last film and he is greatly missed and loved by all he was a wonderful successful talented actor and a great human being he will watch over us all and we will never forget his dynamic smile and spirit great job to all who participated in this film a few cherished scene stealing and humorous cameos to break up the serious content you will enjoy this film go see it,1
15546,a talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all star high school football game when he meets and falls for an attractive local girl she helps him realize he has a shot at a full ride scholarship if he plays well all too often these dramas fall into formulaic traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teen full ride s matt sabo certainly fits this profile but below the surface is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre matt is the center of the action and he is a realistic teenager both over confident and vulnerable optimistic and cynical by turns influenced by amy matt grows into a man of character and heart he in turn forms friendships with his teammates which influences his growth as an athlete and as a team player full ride has all the elements we love to see in a movie great acting admirable characters exciting sports scenes poignant drama and a love story still while one may have seen these elements in other films full ride is assisted by performances that are sincere and occasionally even moving perhaps what s most impressive about full ride is its sense of reality although the author of the previous comment would seem to disagree clearly a disgruntled student who for quite obvious reasons received a poor grade in his film class director mark hoeger grounds the film in a believable situation and location and does a great job of getting down to the grit of what life is like in a small town these characters are real people rooted in realistic situations which often create the most compelling entertainment on one level it is a love story on another it is a character study and yet another it is a simple football film all of these ideas come together to form a cohesive vehicle,1
16770,double shock is one of the many good columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie it has all the elements we like in the columbo episodes we get the laugh when columbo makes something clumsy and it happens more than once in double shock i can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode we also get the riddle as usual with an almost perfect murder but something about the murder troubles columbo the end is the usual we get the story about how columbo solved the mystery this is another good columbo episode and i will rate it 7 10 it is close to 8 10 just one more question the acting peter falk is very good as usual,1
10348,i just finished up this unofficial adaptation of h p lovecraft s the lurking fear that was shot in louisiana outside of a few changes names setting this follows the short story point by point for the first 70 minutes but then tries to inject its own twist ending that you could see coming from a mile away either way it is a much better adaptation than full moon s the lurking fear too bad it is a terrible film director david mccormick shoots the thing with all the flair of an industrial short i swear i counted maybe two camera movements the creature design is cheap we re talking store bought masks here but shot in a dark manner intentional or not where they are somewhat creepy the most impressive thing in the picture is the abandoned mansion but mccormick fails to exploit that as well file this one under good adaptation poor execution,0
5258,i was very excited when paranormal state first came on a e i thought that it may bring some more interesting ghostly evidence the production value looked good and i really love the logo then after about few episodes in i started to feel that this show may not be looking for evidence but had a strong religious agenda it seems like every case they investigate has some big powerful evil demon that can t even make a teacup move on camera yet everyone is terrified then comes some power of christ ritual that saves everyone also there is very little focus on other members of the team the entire show focuses on ryan and he feels like one of those people that hands you pamphlets about his church on the street has paranormal phenomenon and demons become the new missionaries of christianity scaring people to convert really this should be on a christian network i was very disappointed,0
16167,i really enjoyed this movie about a dog who becomes a duke it would have been very easy to mess this one up but along with the humor the script was filled with warmth and even some profundity about nobility and class it s a feel good movie that the whole family can watch even the adults,1
16541,brown returned to his role from the year before in slaughter for this rough follow up film in the original he had avenged his parents slaying by wiping out a huge mob organization in mexico here he is the one being pursued retaliated against by a money launderer portrayed by mcmahon when the first assassination attempt fails brown is back in action once more kicking gangster butt all over the place while trying to protect his new girlfriend hendry while the original film was overall a better and more coherent movie this one delivers all the exploitation aspects in far heavier doses making it more pleasing to fans of the genre aside from a fairly dreary opening on horseback and a downright deadly car ride down a city street at night this movie clips along at a very brisk pace every few minutes there appears one or more of the following drug use sex nudity gunplay murder or some other action brown is his usual reliable amiable self helped by his amazing physical presence which goes a long way in glossing over any stiffness in his acting mcmahon is a riot with tinted glasses and his hair parted down the middle he is shown meting out orders to his gang of thugs and is overheard making passionate love to his fur clad bimbo seeing johnny carson s sidekick in a role like this is a perverse thrill stroud makes an impression as an intense racially bigoted hit man while peters adds just a tinge of class as an upright police detective who enlists brown s aid sadly no mention at all is made of brown s original sidekicks don gordon and stella stevens suddenly brown now has a girlfriend hendry who is likable enough but lacking in the voluptuousness and personality that stevens had before williams does an outrageous turn as a pimp who can seemingly pick any girl out of a bar and make her an instant member of his harem the cinematography and overall direction is less polished than the first film but this one does have a drive and a sense of danger that exceeds the original s feel the film spends a lot of time in the sewage of organized crime drugs prostitution and other vices but it retains interest through the creativity of its action scenes and the now startling lack of political correctness one odd note a key supporting player in the first film was shown getting shot to death but pops up here in a different role,1
21852,ok now at first i thought this was going to be another cheesy romantic comedy which held back on the comedy but this wasn t i mean how could it have been with the fabulous amanda bynes staring in it she was amazing really funny is still stunning the boys in it were also extremely fit one major reason for going girls the plot is strongly based upon the shakespeare play twelfth night as it was extremely similar there was even a spider called malvolio which belonged to the malvolio like character the script was really well written and pulled together and it was very witty the football skills in it were also amazing it even made me think of playing football myself anyway to sum it up this is a light hearted film about young romance which gets very confusing go and see it,1

6031,this is the second adaptation of charlotte armstrong by claude chabrol for the screen the first was la rupture 1970 from novel the balloon man and it s really a pity no one cares about it it s chabrol s sleeper and i urge any of his fans to see it the chocolate cobweb was not that strong a detective story to begin with i read it 20 years ago and forgot all about it the movie promises some good things at first though then finally disappoints to a fault this is a confusing chabrol movie mixing elements of the heyday circa 1969 and a lotta tongue in chick stuff coming from the eighties the likes of poulet au vinaigre not one particularly memorable work part of the disappointment comes from the cast this is a distressingly poor gathering jacques dutronc plays like a zombie isabelle huppert reveals herself a somewhat limited actress finally rather vulgar it worked in une affaire de femme it does not here they are not supported by the young couple both are bland and unremarkable actors from the past say stephane audran or michel bouquet both in la rupture were brilliant and contributed to chabrol s then unique atmosphere the story itself is undistinguished beginning as some kind of serious la vie est un long fleuve tranquille besides a character hints at etienne chatilliez s very funny movie the movie drags on and on as a laughable psychological drama afterwards we will not congratulate the young female pianist who after all she learned about her wicked hostess agrees to drive a car along a dangerous road because he makes too many movies chabrol frequently releases turkeys one wonder why people who wants to watch one of his movies should choose this one among all his stuff up for grabs it seems that chabrol s bourgeoise satire has finally given way to leniency in la rupture the first armstrong adaptation an average detective story which chabrol completely transcended you should hear audran say they have so much money here chabrol has lost his bite his strength,0
2243,this is realism if rivette was seeking to give us a ground level study of a woman in a certain place and time and how she was able to influence and was influenced by the world around her he has failed miserably most prominently because we never get a clue as to why thousands of men would have followed her into battle there is certainly not enough exposition of the cultural historical context to define the country s need for such a savior and god knows there is nothing particularly charismatic about joan as she is presented here unless bonnaire s wooden posturing and flat line readings are supposed to indicate transcendent faith and determination the use of landscape is particularly uninspired we never lose the feeling we are watching twentieth century actors wandering in a supposedly medieval landscape and as for the battle scenes which in contrast to some commentors claims do take up a good 15 of screentime they look like look like some some history club from your local high school recreating a medieval siege although the kids would no doubt put more passion into it i will give rivette credit however for picturing a side of joan left out by other movies that of a petulant naive and narcissistic adolescent played by a woman all too clearly at least twice the age of the character she is supposed to portray obviously unable to understand her place within the movement she is helping to create or the world existing outside her own passions joan s outrage at her own soldiers swearing and astonishment at the enemy for their lack of respect and obedience to her are jarringly spontaneous and believable notes you suddenly realize such moments must naturally have occurred in an otherwise uninvolving historical representation unfortunately they also serve to point out precisely what is not addressed on screen what made joan special i must say i also continued to be puzzled and frustrated by certain foreign film lovers who equate tedium and lack of dramatic involvement with artistry and seriousness does this film really increase our understanding or involvement with the subject or with anything for that matter 4 10,0
21011,people criticize nsna because it is a low point in bond god sean connery s career and because it is unofficial may contain spoilers first of all this movie is better then any other bond film featuring any other actor then connery all sub par wannabes in my book sean connery is the only real bond no one comes even close to his toughness good looks and sex appeal yes this movie is a low point in connery s bond career but it is still the definet best bond film of the 80 s sean connery is the only bond actor who is good at an older age he did not become a baggy mess like moore but kept his good looks and toughness but gaining some gray hair so what hes still the only real 007 and he is as cool and tough as ever sean connery is the one and only 007 and this movie is definitly worth seeing no matter what anyone says no gun barrel opening but you can t have everything can you great theme song though,1
23203,i first saw this in the 70s on syndicated tv and admired its production values which were high tech for the time the remastered video is rich and colorful far more intense then the pale 35 mm tv prints this movie deserves more attention it paved the way for ufo space 1999 and even star wars with its detailed miniatures and cleverly conceived gadgets sure the story of an alternative anti matter planet earth has been recycled a hundred times since star trek but the beauty of this film is its self conscious european flair for design from the rolls royce space engines to the euro sec letterhead business paper jfss or dopplegangers as it was called in europe is enjoyable for the imaginary vision of europe in space in the shadow of the superpowers gerry and sylvia anderson s ambitious epic gets a little tedious when the american astronaut finally realizes that he is on the doppleganger earth and everything is literally downhill after the poetically graceful shuttle boarding sequence a mediocre story is helped along by a grand and lyrical classical score by the late great barry gray the john williams of britain,1
21324,words fail me whenever i want to describe my feelings about this movie and the sequels does it have flaws sure it does starting with the subspecies themselves which were not executed well enough for a special effect so why do i glorify these movies for the herd of movie mass consumers out there who care more about quantity than quality about cheap fun more than about depth crap like blade it doesn t even deserve a capital letter underworld dracula 2000 dracula 3000 and so on are good movies to munch popcorn to and drink a couple of cokes what makes subspecies a superior effort for anyone claiming to be a vampire fanatic on the other hand is obvious the vampire himself is romanian the story is set in transylvania the scenes filmed on location are more than convincing and the atmosphere is not based on any action packed chases or expensive orchestral music radu himself is the source of the atmosphere this is what a vampire should look like and this is how he should behave add a breathtakingly gloomy castle with dark passageways situated in romania include some typical vampiric elements such as the movement of the shadows on the walls when the vampires take to flight and you have a work of art in short if like me you re fascinated with vampires and feel that their appearance as well as the setting should be sinister and dark there s no better place to look in than in a subspecies movie or in vampire journals the brilliant spin off of the former,1

17504,when it opened in london during the christmas season of 1969 this musical version of james hilton s famous story was drubbed by the critics the same reception greeted it when it opened in the us prompting mgm to withdraw its roadshow status and cut almost all of its songs what a mistake watched years later when the trendy world of the 60 s and 70 s has turned in upon itself this version of goodbye mr chips is a total delight first of all as chipping peter o toole gives one of his greatest performances to watch him turn from the hated cold emotionless latin teacher at a boy s boarding school to a man who finally can see the colors in the world after falling for and marrying musical star catherine briskit is to see a genius at work if you can watch lawrence of arabia the lion in winter my favorite year and chips back to back over a number of days or weeks then you will see what a truly great actor o toole is and how magnificent he is in chips catherine as played by the glowing petula clark at the height of her popularity is ever man s dream beautiful loving understanding with a great voice to boot most of the songs are beautiful and fit the story perfectly while the direction by the late herbert ross brings the proceedings wonderfully to life okay this film may be a bit too romantic for some people but for those who are looking for a beautifully acted sung and directed love story look no further if you can get your hands of the laser disc wide screen version better yet i am anxiously awaiting chips debut on dvd,1
17405,not too much top s the classic top gun or independence day when it comes to fighter jet excitement yes the movie top to bottom is based on a truly fictional example of how anyone can pull off a rescue but it is cool because it breaks all traditional rules the kid doing what he wants to do in a jet the way he wants to do it i can t really put my finger on just what i love about this movie but others i know that saw the movie feel the same way about it i do i think its just basically a lot of fun but maybe a little too unrealistic for some to buy into again regardless i loved it people who i know saw it loved it so its definitely worth seeing to make your own decisions about it put it this way i thought that top gun was one of the best fighter pilot movies ever and i like this movie just as much if not more than top gun don t miss out do see it a truly inspirational movie,1
23725,lucasarts have pulled yet another beauty out of a seemingly bottomless bag of great games if any further proof was required that they rule this genre of gaming then this is it before actually playing the game there was a little concern about how the writers were going to keep up the pace of gags after the first two games fears were rife that it was going to wear a bit thin play the game and see how quickly those fears are allayed from the introductory video with guybrush in the dodgem boat to the closing stages in the funfair the jokes just keep on coming i was a great fan of the first two games and the other lucasarts works day of the tentacle sam max etc and this one does not fail to deliver the quality you will not be disappointed well i wasn t,1
19040,shame is rather unique as a war film or rather quite the anti war film in that it not only doesn t focus on the soldiers or politics involved there is politics but not how you d think it d be shown it deals with its two main subjects as the only two beings that can possibly be cared about at all in this brutal decaying society they inhabit ingmar bergman in the midst of his prime and following two other heavily psychological films persona and hour of the wolf is far more interested in seeing what the effect of war has on usually civilized beings that it brings out the worst in them and also in a cathartic way is a reminder of what is truly crucial in living his two key actors are frequent collaborators and friends max von sydow and liv ullman as the rosenbergs oddly enough who are musicians living on a farm on an island not too dissimilar from wolf when one thinks about it they see the tanks roll by and a couple of old friends already getting worn down but they try not to put it too much to heart there s a sweet scene where the couple just talk rather frankly but with heart all one shot as is repeated through the film is to perhaps create a sense of being provoked then comes the trouble including a fake film of propaganda made at gunpoint with the rosenbergs the psychological turmoil in being prisoners of war and the terror involved with a friend in the military one of gunnar bjornstrand s most subtle works with bergman needless to say this is not one of the easier films to go through in terms of bergman s filmography however for some it may be one of his more accessible works his religious themes this time is kept very low key even as the idea of keeping a sort of faith pervades the film s atmosphere when there is war action it s shot in unconventional quick ways via great amigo sven nykvist and the deconstruction of the relationship between jan and eva is corresponded successfully with the backdrop of a chaotic kind of war ground where the lines are never too surely drawn in a way this film shot right at the height of the worst times in vietnam is even more relevant for today i couldn t help but see chilling uncompromising coincidences between iraq and elsewhere with some of jan and eva s scenes with the fighters or those in charge the very last scene by the way is one of bergman s very best all around acting directing lighting it s not the kind of war picture or again anti war i find little of the john wayne spirit in this svensk production that i would recommend right off the bat to my friends all into saving private ryan it has a little more in kinship with paths of glory looking at the effects of the hypocrisy of war but in reality like any of bergman s genre films it stands alone however one that packs a wallop for the art house crowd,1
9093,there needs to be a 0 10 option for bilge like this it was painful to watch but strangely compelling all the same compelling because it seemed unbelievable that a movie could actually suck this much i kept thinking it must get better it got worse and worse how on earth were people conned into producing such a categorical piece of junk i ll never know the most surprising thing of all though is all these reviews i see of people actually loving the movie yes the acting was good but the movie was very very very bad worst movie ever,0
23047,i watched this movie recently and fell in love with it i loved the storyline and the actors it has a little of everything i was completely taken by the unfolding of the story it has so many surprises along the way i highly recommend it in fact i loved it so much that i ran out and bought the book i felt i had to read it in order to appreciate the art in the writing behind the movie i also wanted to make sure i didn t miss anything that was in the book but kept out of the movie i recommend people who love the movie to read the book because there is enough difference in the book especially in the second episode to want to read it it has become my favorite movie i am now a sarah waters and elaine cassidy fan,1
12475,if you liked william hickey in prizzi s honor he resurrects his character as don anthony in mob boss this is a very weak godfather satire with few laughs stuart whitman looks perplexed as to what he s doing in this schlock fest morgan fairchild s performance is one of the better efforts in the movie and that alone is not a good sign for sure eddie deezen vacillates between three stooges slapstick and a bad woody allen imitation fatally flawed mob boss is so derivative that boredom quickly overcomes comedy and the film drags on with car chases hidden weapons in a restaurant bathroom and numerous other nonsense merk,0
16174,incredibly hilarious mid 70 s italian rootsploitation with lots of non consensual s m lesbian sex gratuitous racial cruelty etc few redeeming cinematic qualities except for the fairly cool theme music with dubby african drums and flute brilliant sample dialog white slave owner to white plantation manager you re so dumb i ll bet you forgot to interrogate that n r midwife white plantation manager not only did i interrogate her i did it so well she died before i could get any answers from her all the black actors have 70 s afros and say yes massa in a high pitched voice the female lead has sex with everybody on the plantation 10 stars for fans of tasteless sleaze,1
18360,the end of suburbia neatly collects many of the concerns with the coming peak of the world s oil supply as the world population grows so does demand for oil and power as we extract oil and power we come to a peak in production more oil is demanded less oil is generated the inevitable outcome is conflict and major change this film will be disturbing and alarming if you re new to the topic you may react at first with anger and denial because the implications are so grim it should be required viewing beyond politics beyond optimism the math is undeniable suburbia is the focus because our suburban living areas will be the communities most impacted when the price of energy skyrockets while intuitive logic would tell you that the big cities will be the places to avoid during a time of crisis the spread out nature of suburbia will make it difficult if not impossible to maintain an efficient community without our vehicles to transport us peak oil is no longer a topic for discussion by survivalists and backwoods crazies this issue will be at our doorstep sooner than we think this film is a lucid coherent look at it,1
2393,to me this film is just a very very lame teen party movie with all the normal clich s and boring stereotyped characters nerds jocks popular girls sleezy guys etc but with an underlying anti drug drinking theme if you ever have the unfortunate chance of seeing this film keep an eye out for all the references to responsibility and keeping it real dunno how else to word it i guess the only thing that d make this film cool would be if they tv playing it was on fire that or dvd it was on exploded 1 out of 10000 watch animal house instead,0
16763,it s a good watch if u have time deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight and get into serious trouble they find themselves fighting some shadowy people and can t deal with very very disturbing portrayal of japan the arbitrariness of modern life some intense scenes but a bit of a potboilerthe spoiler was that the plot is not too clear based on english sub titles obviously i don t know japanese the only other japanese movies i ve seen were kurosawa who is a different and far loftier than this modern genre so can t really compare otherwise it compares better with most hollywood blockbusters for story plot and buildup taptieg24,1
19118,hey now i have never laid eyes on a manga comic but apparently this movie is based on one ah well such is life anyway this is a pretty bizarre to say the least movie as things literally spiral out of control in a small japanese town people are becoming obsessed with the uzumaki spiral and this young girl watches her friend s father videotape a snail and later in the movie people start becoming snails it also seems this boy s dad becomes so obsessed he somehow commits suicide in a household appliance there is some bizarre humor here that might be at home in a tim burton movie but there is some nastiness gore like only the japanese can do with justice as with a lot of japanese films though the ending is the ending and did anything get resolved well not to my mind it didn t there are some hints as to why this is all happening but they aren t explored and there s a lot left to either the imagination or else it wasn t deemed important still though there are lots of things for the eye to feast on and if you aren t obsessed with everything making perfect sense this is well worth seeing because it s just so original and bizarre my favorite was the father with the spinning eyeballs personally 8 out of 10 stars,1
21167,it s particularly hard for a director to capture film making without getting precious inbred over dramatic or all three breillat ably demonstrates the instinctive lizard brain methods of a female auteur in extracting from two cattle as hitchcock called actors a love scene of searing intimacy her main battle is with her leading man an actor is really a woman she opines although naturally it is the leading lady who will steal the show i disagree that this is breillat s first comedy romance was at various points hilarious but i accept that the french sense of humour can be elusive for foreigners indeed dozens of imdb reviewers detected no comedy in romance by contrast sex is comedy raises plenty of laughs mainly by using an actor s prop that goes back thousands of years to plautus and the ancient greeks we wondered leaving the theatre whether roxane s beard was a wig a lovely performance from anne parillaud as breillat wrestling with her own script looking ten years younger than her age,1
4835,this movie is about a group of people who are infected by a powerful man made virus they are pursued by government men into the desert the premise of the film is quite interesting but is hampered by the fact that the delivery is extremely boring at no point does the film engage with the viewer on any level granted the miniscule budget is a problem but is not the reason for the film s failure much more at fault is the very po faced delivery there is a great deal of narration but unfortunately the narrator has an annoyingly over dramatic voice very little seems to happen to these people and well before the end you will be rooting for the government men the sooner they kill the protagonists the sooner the movie will end a much better title for this film would have been four people run about in the desert with some stock footage of a helicopter overall very tedious,0
17923,the directing is brilliant the casting is remarkable though i would ve loved to have seen a little more of aaron lustig from y r fame who played paul shaffer i only have two minor quips about the film as subtle as they are one roebuck s leno is excellent but his stage presence i e during what appears the taping of one of his late show episodes is a tad underwhelming two the distribution of the foul language i am willing to tolerate foul language so long as it is not used gratuitously and to a degree the film was gratuitous the language seemed to be used as a tool to reduce the pathos of bates otherwise well portrayed kushnick by her frequent use of it and served to make roebuck s leno a goody goody by his lack of use of it of course if the characters really did behave this way kudos to everybody nonetheless the piece is an excellent one as far as television and video are concerned the film i feel had potential for the big screen but would ve required re casting for the bit parts and probably a different director as well the aesthetic feel is that of the larry sanders show good for hbo mediocre for cinematic purposes,1
16265,this is one of chaplin s first national films from the period between his glorious mutual shorts and the more mature united artists features more opulent than the mutual films it continues chaplin s quest for perfecting his comic expression most people forget that the film is actually a dream that charlie has while awaiting being sent off to the front there is plenty of slapstick via the limburger cheese being used to gas the enemy and chaplin s foray into enemy territory dressed as a tree by this stage in this career the great man had become so immersed in filmic expression that his films give the impression of making themselves doubtless this was not the case but still it gives as convincingly realistic view of life at the front as i can remember albeit from an ironically humorous perspective as far as i am concerned familiarity with the entirety of chaplin s work should be a prerequisite for all cinephiles do not delay,1
11534,what a terrible sequel the reason i give this film two stars instead of zero because it s a movie that has violence and gore and critters yet it is planned out poorly and this god awful sequel was done by none other than bum bum bum bum mick garris the bonehead that brought you the remake of the shining which nearly got kubrick to nearly roll in his grave when he discovered it was actually made garris is also the man that brought you the sad sequel of the fly the fly which was a wonderful movie but garris s movie nearly ruined john getz career anyway if you really want to see the crappy critters trilogy in order don t that s the mistake i made rent the first one or the third one or better yet don t stoop to that level at all this movie sucked so bad that i can t believe it please avoid this crap shame on you mick,0

21732,no matter how you feel about michael jackson himself you can t deny that this video is the most unique video of all time there is no other video that is even remotely close to thriller the first time i saw it was when i was 6 years old and it scared me bad now i watch it with a smile because i can now appreciate the marvel that it is i love this video and it will be around for as long as music videos exist i think everyone should sit down and watch it when its on sometime and look back and see how great it was especially for being 1983,1

17787,although it isn t half as hilarious as chicken run the new wallace and gromit comedy the curse of the were rabbit out of yields more laughs than most live action comedies british director nick park who created the wallace and gromit characters and co director steve box rely on the old fashioned stop motion method of animation known best as claymation to create several visually adorable characters in more than enough side splitting scenes about a monstrously mutant hare out to devour every vegetable in sight amusing as its whimsical storyline is the heart of the hilarity lies in the imaginative way with which park and company have painstakingly constructed characters and gags out of a brand of modeling clay called plasticine basically every shot that you see in the curse of the were rabbit required patient souls that made minor alterations in the clay characters for a series of individual shots that merge into a veritable montage of merriment hollywood pioneered claymation as a form of animation as far back as the silent movies of the 1920s before the industry turned its back on the complicated process aardman studio animators managed to crank out a mere three seconds of usable footage per day for the record the curse of the were rabbit took five years to make the lumpy looking characters with thumb prints clearly visible in their respective clay complexions look incredibly funny with their ping pong ball eyes and over biting mouths interestingly gromit emerges as the funniest character a lovable mutt with no mouth but an expressively inexpressive face who says more than most of the talking characters wallace and gromit are respectively master and pooch as the human half of the duo wallace is a homily looking moron without a clue who somehow manages to construct machines that do some rather incredible things one of the funnier scenes shows master and pooch awakened by a system of chutes hatches and spring operated contraptions that dress and feed them meanwhile gromit is the animal half the running joke is that gromit shows more common sense than his genius of a master as good as his ideas and inventions are wallace could not succeed without the loyal gromit giving him a hand our heroes run a pest protection business called anti pesto essentially they must protect every vegetable patch for miles around using an ungainly looking device called a bun van 6000 that literally sucks rabbits out of their ground and into a huge glass container no wallace and gromit don t kill the critters instead they keep them as pets and wallace experiments with an invention mind o matic designed to convert hares into carrot haters this frankenstein meets the fly approach plunges poor wallace into deep trouble when he swaps bits of his brain with that of a rabbit not long thereafter a mysterious towering terror stalks the vegetable patches on full moon nights and creates chaos for everyone as the village s 517th annual vegetable contest approaches initially wallace and gromit appeared in park s oscar nominated film school project a grand day out 1989 since then aardman has released ten other animated shorts among them wallace and gromit a close shave 1993 and the oscar winning wallace and gromit the wrong trousers 1995 curse of the were rabbit differs not only because it represents the duo s big screen debut but also it runs a whopping 85 minutes the first two thirds of were rabbit contain better gags than the last third but park and company never miss a chance to slip in an adult joke that kids won t get but attentive grown ups will appreciate wallace and gromit the curse of the were rabbit is hare raising fun,1
7343,i m writing this as i watch the dvd i grabbed for the laptop and went to imdb during the first song i didn t know anything about the movie except that a friend said that the show was supposed to be good it has a decent netflix rating too so here i am maybe on the stage this worked but i have to say that the sight of chorus boys dancing and singing completely naked just seems silly and the lip syncing to a prerecorded score adds to the strangeness most of the songs and routines are about aspects of male nudity this is my idea of nothing sorry the score so far is generic show tune music nothing memorable or particularly melodic everything is to serve the lyrics which i have to say sound like they were written by a committee each song is essentially one extended joke if the jokes were ten seconds they might work these single several minute long jokes don t i m now watching the movie by chapters a few minutes until i get the gist kind of in the hopes that one of them will be different or entertaining enough to keep me from going on to the next scene nope okay i m finished so here s what i think if you have any experience or long standing appreciation of musical theater avoid this it s just not quality if however you re a gay twenty something and have never seen or heard a musical comedy you might be entertained or maybe this would hold your interest if you ve never seen a lot of attractive naked men i have,0
19497,i m not sure how the imdb weighted average came up with such a low rating on this film it is in my opinion and by all other accounts an overlooked gem of a movie rip torn is fantastic as the stubborn noel lord and tantoo cardinal superlative as his housemate torn and cardinal are both underrated actors who are finally given a stage to work their craft on their relationship isn t always pleasant but it s very real this is not the humerous and touching love story it s billed as on the dvd jacket in the end it is a tragedy lord simply aims too high and ignores all the advice to take the money offered by the power company to move the music is fantastic as are the period sets,1

1854,when i say worse i mean less entertaining todd sheets seems to have learned some stupid camera tricks since the last zombie bloodbath which makes the movie even less tolerable in the last movie there were no special camera effects where in this one we are treated to shaky cam and constant switching to black and white also this is called zombie bloodbath despite the fact that the zombies are barely in this one the movie starts in 1945 where some satanists kill a violent burglar and put him up as a scarecrow back in modern time some kids have a car problem and go to a house the same house in which the satanist murder happened some mean people try to rape the kids or something and they bring the scarecrow burglar back to life who comes back with some zombies and now talks like darth vader mr sheets amped up the language and lessened the violence if you want to see what a bad movie is check this out my rating bomb 96 mins not rated contains violence and language,0
5052,mr moto s gamble has a fairly straight forward plot when a boxer is murdered in the ring with a mysterious poison it s up to the even more mysterious mr moto to solve the case i m shocked at the number of positive reviews for mr moto s gamble on imdb because to me well i found it extremely disappointing i enjoy mr moto and i enjoy charlie chan but i can t say i cared for this mish mash of the two for those unfamiliar with the story behind mr moto s gamble it was originally intended to be a charlie chan film but when warner oland backed out some of the scenes and action were rewritten for peter lorre and mr moto as i indicated the end result left me underwhelmed mr moto is not chan he s more mysterious he s more athletic and he s more exotic so trying to put moto in a chan film is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole it doesn t work and listening to lorre moto try to deliver one of chan s trademark euphemisms just ends up sounding silly add to that the fact that almost 10 minutes of the already brief 72 minute runtime is made up of boxing scenes something that i never seem to enjoy and you end up with a movie that i couldn t help but dislike if i have to say something positive i would point to the performance of keye luke but even he s not near enough to save mr moto s gamble in my eyes sorry but a 4 10 is about the best i can give this one,0
2674,since i am not a big steven seagal fan i thought this was a pretty good movie it is apparent that his fans are very displeased with this drama that lacks an over abundance of martial arts and brute force gailard sartain plays a self claimed patriot leader of a militia in a standoff with the atf for weapons violations he surrenders with the intentions of releasing a deadly virus seagal is a former cia agent turned country doctor that pressures himself to find the antidote for the lethal bug that has incapacitated a small town his grandpa s native american herbal remedy figures into the salvation notable appearances by l q jones camilla belle and silas weir mitchell my personal favorite in this movie is whitney yellow robe she is stunning and appears to have what it takes to take on a more challenging role despite the far fetched ending this was a decent movie that could have used a lot more action,0
1015,a 10 year old kid fed up with his parents arguing decides to hot wire a car and go on a surreal journey across america to find motorama cards which is a gas station card game that if he can find to spell out motorama he has a chance to win 500 million dollars he meets many bizarre characters along the way no one can make an instant cult classic joe minion s previous after hours achieved that by sheer merit an amazing director but it wasn t instant this movie on the other hand is just bizarre just to be bizarre no rhyme or reason to any of it the plot is incidental at best and seems to exist just to showcase various cameos it s just not a fun film nor a thoughtful one it s way too slapped together i ve heard many comparisons between this and david lynch films that s damn near heresy as even lynch s worst film worst in quotes as he doesn t have an bad films really is still miles above this dreck eye candy cynthia king is topless very briefly dvd extras trailer for joe dirt,0

17376,john parrish is an ex union officer who plans to sell his ranch and land to the wilkison s over at anchor the trouble is that the price being offered is way to low and when they start to bully parrish and his workers he has a change of heart particularly when things take a brutal turn for the worse originally after watching this one i had a sense of frustration chiefly because of the cast that was involved when you got edward g robinson glenn ford and barbara stanwyck in the same movie you hope that they get a story and script from which to excel sadly they don t get chance to produce a western classic worthy of multiple revisits or is that my over expectation is doing it a disservice well i slept on it and decided to ponder further about the picture i think yes it s fair to say that the actors in question deserved a better story from which to work from it is when all is said and done a plot that has been milked for all it s worth and then some but the violent men is still a very rewarding film regardless of the missed opportunities evident with the production glenn ford as parrish is as cool as an eskimo s nose throughout and it s always great to see babs stanwyck playing a bitch because she s good at it while eddie g when one gets used to him being in a western is fine in what is an under written part robinson who stepped in at the last minute when first choice as lee wilkison broderick crawford got injured is the one who is short changed the most by the makers even supporting characters such as the devilish wade matlock a grinning delight from the reliable richard jaeckel and judith wilkison a radiant dianne foster get something to leave an impression with but for what it is robinson s crutch toting bad guy is at the least memorable for all the right reasons not shy on action and gun play it s with the twists and almost shakespearean tragedies that rudolph mat s film rises above the mundane with all of it gorgeously framed by burnett guffey s stunning cinematography lone pine in alabama has been used on many a western picture see seven men from now for another glorious use of it but here guffey really excels and manages to dazzle the eyes at every turn the violent men isn t a great western picture and perhaps a better director than mat could have really given donald hamilton s the big country novel an adaptation to be proud of but for every niggle and irk i personally had with it i found two more reasons to actually really like it so that it be it s recommended for sure 7 10,1
2047,rich vs poor big city vs small town white collar vs blue collar these things are not original themes in movies so when one chooses to involve these themes the situational story line had better be very original or very good this one was neither i never believed in the romance of the two young lovers in this movie neither convincing nor compelling it just fell flat don t bother even with a video rental,0
22484,the recent history of hollywood remakes of ghost horror films from the east has been dismal this film will inevitably suffer the same fate so get a copy on e bay or similar it is well photographed and the sound is superb viewing on a good screen and with a good 5 1 or dts enabled sound system is recommended obviously it is subtitled so if that puts you off then i wouldn t bother with this dubbing rarely works and simply would not do here it is also genuinely frightening with excellent performances from a cast who will be unfamiliar to western audiences i would particularly single out the stepmother character who was utterly brilliant the ending will have you wanting to watch it again if you can cope the plot is relentless and offers no comforting moments of release along the way if i do have a small criticism there is perhaps a detectable influence in certain scenes from the japanese version of the ring we have however accepted straight copies of other peoples ideas for western films for years and so my point is a limited one which did not prevent me from giving it 10 10 i believe most fans of this genre will derive huge pleasure from this film which i for one hope goes down as a classic,1
5232,yeah i made it all the way to the end it was pretty hard though sometimes i was wondering if there was even a director on set the acting well i don t even know what to say i thought the girl who played emily tried her best with the boring sometimes wacky and sometimes predictable dialog i know that it was low budget but the hollow sound and the lighting unfortunately made it look and sound like a 100 minute long audition tape i m not even going to talk about the ending the best thing about the movie was the music that being said i do not recommend this movie to anyone even for lesbians who don t have many movies to watch overall this is nothing to waste your time on if you re looking for a sad lesbian themed movie check out the children s hour lost and delirious or high art those will all leave you depressed and gloomy but you won t have to suffer cinematic hell in the process,0
14163,closet land tells a powerful story and has many different subtle elements you could read lots of stuff about the movie s plot before hand but you don t really need to all you need to know is that the movie is all about an interrogation along the way we learn lots of things about the interrogator and the person being interrogated we also learn that the world can be a dark and scary place especially when you have absolutely no control over it in the end the movie amounts to a warning really though the movie has several different aspects to it about what happens to people s freedoms when they look the other way and ignore injustices happening to those around them if you ve got about an hour and a half and know where you can rent this i strongly recommend that you do so,1
14598,i have a 4yr old daughter and before this movie she was all about the disney princesses now she watched this movie and all she can talk about is princess genevieve and all her sisters i definitely recommend this movie for all young girls this movie is one of the best from the barbie collection it shows all the good values that any mother would love to encourage on there little girls with the great songs and dance moves it gets my daughter up and trying to mimic the moves the extras are also good one even works on how good your memory is i would definitely have say it is a must see for kids and grown ups alike,1
4642,this western musical comedy is not one of the best of the genre i have seen i found it much too slow it just plodded along to the inevitable end i also found it disjointed i couldn t wait for it to be over randolph scott is the headliner here and lloyd bridges also stars but for my money money edgar buchanan is the best of the bunch buchanan appeared in many westerns in his day many times providing comic relief as he does in this picture i also liked ann dvorak as rita otherwise though i can t think of much to recommend this movie the movie is based on a novel by ernest haycock who also wrote the novel stagecoach which was mad into a movie of the same name in 1939 and remade in 1966 and again in 1986 the 1939 version of stagecoach is in my mind one of the best movies ever made anyway as for abilene town my vote is a 3 10,0
13451,big fat liar is a great watch for kids of all ages even adults i had a great time watching this movie and recommend this to kids of 10 years and under the laughs never end and the adventurous plot is pretty good too frankie muniz is funny and marty wolfe is hilarious overall a nicely made film for kids to enjoy and just have a great time,1
11942,i was one chosen to see this movie in a sneak preview first you should know that this film is based on the video game far cry a for its time really good game 2004 second you should know that the regisseur of this flick is the great uwe boll this is a man who takes video games dungeon siege bloodrayne postal etc and makes movies out of them very horrible ones i still remember when i saw boll s the king s swords a dungeon siege tail there were so horrible mistakes in this film like 3 scenes playing at the same time 2 at day time and one somehow at night so lets come to far cry if you expect cool action forget it really cheap tricks and a plastic helicopter are far away from real action if you expect a cool story forget it orientating by the not so bad story of the game this movie is a laugh the actors playing makes the movie in a lot of moments funny but in a no good way i had the chance to see this movie for free so do not do the mistake and pay for this trash its one of my favorised flicks for the bottom 100,0
18763,this feels as if it is a czech version of pearl harbor it has a same story both guys fall in love with the same woman and add to the twist the woman is actually a married one whose husband has been missing for a year i don t think that the story line is too strong the younger guy is quite naughty that is cute it kept me watching because of the emotional music and the pleasing scenes one after another it also has some strong visual special affects best of all the love stories is seamlessly integrated with the story i think that if it was in english it would be such a big shot all across the states it is too bad that not that many people are open for foreign movies,1
5249,i initially tuned in to paranormal state because i more or less find the paranormal search genre to be interesting tv if nothing else i really enjoy ghost hunters because well over half of their investigations result in total debunking and find most haunted to be hilarious with its use of mediums and frumpy british women with paris hilton day glo eyes fainting from fear demonic presences all shot in lovely night vision green paranormal state has none of this appeal it feels like it was cobbled together from leads that ghost hunters rejected the episodes ranged from trailer trash families and single mothers with emo adolescents sitting around and scaring themselves to an interview with a 5 year old about the monster who lives in his room the monster goes rawrrr we are told all of these people calling upon a college club to solve their problems the whole show is about ryan and his partner his enormous ego he leads his troupe of doe eyed coeds around except when a case is deemed too extreme and orders them to remain at the hotel hahaha better leave it to the pros ie himself the unwitting comedy of this show is all in how gullible the participants are ryan spins his tales of being hunted followed etc by a demon that he first encountered when the catholic church recruited him to assist on a case sorry but the catholic church has people who can do that they don t need the day shift manager at quiznos to chip in his 2 cents this show is awful shame on a e for bankrolling this silliness trying to follow in the footsteps of some much better paranormal themed shows it s almost unintentionally funny except that ryan is so arrogant and devoid of charisma that watching the show long enough to mock it isn t worth the trouble,0
14749,i cannot understand why this 1971 hollywood production is currently only available through an australian video company but such is the unfortunate obscurity of this peter sellers classic leonard maltin s movie guide continues to grant it the same bomb review they gave it in the 1970 s with so many scene stealers on display sellers comes through with what may perhaps be his most hilarious role it all begins with his discovery of a patient who expired at 11 15am but sellers argues that the corpse is still living due to the fact that the new day doesn t start until noon the final straw for the beleaguered hospital commissioner comes in that very room the do not disturb sign still on the door once he exits the room handkerchief holding his nose there is a brief conversation with the doctor with him doctor we can t save them all that man was at least 85 commissioner how old was he when he died 63 harold gould plays an inept surgeon who shuts his eyes when the knife digs in richard lenz whose pompous ass reporter in the shootist was booted in the rear by john wayne plays the patient who exposes the fraud he only came in for a chest x ray until they discovered he owns a house also in the cast on screen and supplying some excellent country flavored music is keith allison former guitarist for paul revere and the raiders who also worked with michael nesmith on a few monkees recordings and co wrote auntie s municipal court with nesmith on 1968 s the birds the bees and the monkees alas there is some missing footage from this print including a topless sequence with uschi digard near the end also a scene with actress kathleen freeman who wants to use green stamps to finance her operation who gets locked by sellers in his office never to be seen again in the uncut version he returns to his office to find that she has written in large letters on the wall unfair prick his response you misspelled price,1
11904,if you love movies about fruity dudes who prance around with a top hats and canes while spouting off random line of poetry while stabbing their victims then this is the movie for you if you like movies where it looks like the whole thing was shot with a camcorder and when people get disemboweled their internal organs are made out of baked ziti an marinara sauce this movie is even more for you and if you simply love movies where the acting and dialogue sucks so much that it makes you feel dead inside then for god s sake run to the video store right now and buy this movie right now hurry go before it sells out,0

10636,the only reason i gave this episode of masters of horror a 2 instead of a 1 is because the two lead actors are good and it wasn t shot on vhs the story the dialog and the plot are ridiculous talking driving zombies who come back to vote and sway the political tide against the war give me a break what next zombies who come back to go skydiving maybe zombies who come back to host qvc shows i never supported the iraq war but i do support the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces and homecoming was disrespectful in that it mocks the true horror of war with zombies being mass produced in today s market this is the spam of zombie related entertainment how homecoming made it onto masters of horror is beyond me,0
6655,and now i m up to episode 7 i really was hoping it d be over by now not to mention canceled once everything connected with the show including the actors had been dumped along with some toxic waste in the middle of the ocean somewhere never to be seen again because this series really is dire to have this program listed under the genre of comedy is at best misleading it s so hard to believe ben elton could write something this bad maybe this points to a lot of input from the other writers in everything he s been connected with before in some episodes i haven t even laughed once oh and i can t believe ardal o hanlon actually stopped doing my hero started doing this instead his decision making skills were obviously impaired that day perhaps he simply can t read and didn t realise just how poor the scripts for blessed were don t get me wrong my hero is not masterpiece but it s a million times better than this piece of junk and just to annoy me even more i bet this gets a dvd release as well when there are so many great tv series that aren t getting released,0
23027,i personally found the film to be great i had it on pre order for a month and watched it twice the day i got it in the mail and several time since yes the time lapses may be a bit much but the rest of the movie clearly compensates for it all amature cast yet the acting was right on for each part the plot itself is just haggard there s no other way to describe it who makes a movie about someone getting f gered bam thats who genius simply genius two thumbs up i would be honored to work with him any day any time on any thing,1

20378,this don siegel clint eastwood strange and hypnotic drama was left by the wayside in 1971 and what a pity a fascinating character study with some great women for squint to deal with geraldine page was one of our supreme actresses and she s perfectly cast young jo ann harris is a flirty minx and elizabeth hartman who died too young is undeniably repressed a 7 out of 10 best performance c eastwood released the same year as dirty harry this did no business beside getting some good reviews seek this out unless you re only into explosion films very subtle and frightening this piece will stick with you,1
19575,i saw this at the screening at gencon in indy i had some time to kill and decided to check it out it played to about 1000 people in a packed standing room only ballroom wow what a ride the script was tight the action tense the pacing perfect the character exposition excellent one thing i really appreciated was that you knew going in that this wasn t a big budget film yet it soon became obvious that the creators pushed their sets and effects as far as they could despite their limitations and it was more than enough it s true that this film was targeted at a certain audience gamers tabletop players the creators make no effort to hide that but other filmmakers could learn a lot from them for in going for the jugular in scene after scene and not worrying about if mom who happens to be watching will get it they got the biggest laughs time and time again but there s enough universality there that mom will be laughing too even if she s not in on every joke i think too many times i see films that try so hard to lower the bar to the lowest common denominator so that they will appeal to the most people but the movie just ends up suffering for it but not this flick indeed this film was so solid that it had the audience wrapped around it s finger from the opening credits and while the viewers around me really wanted to like the film they weren t pushovers gamers can be among the most critical niche out there i m so glad i got to see this in a big crowd at least 10 times the audience was having such a good time that they erupted into applause at a joke or scene during the film how often does that happen at screenings it should be no surprise that there was a huge standing ovation when the closing credits rolled for my own part i can t wait for this to be released after it ended one of the producers said they were shooting for a simultaneous tv dvd release that date cannot come soon enough,1
1218,i was pleasantly surprised with this one it s actually quite interesting and engaging the cast is strong even dan cortese brooke shields has come into her own as an actress black and white must have really set her free cause i have never seen her in this much command playing a conventional character if marketed right could be a medium size hit,0
6019,i had the privilege of seeing this powerful play on broadway with kathy bates in the lead i only saw one other play in the 1970 s 1990 s that had an emotional impact like this play did i really looked forward to the play being made into a movie but was very disappointed when i learned that kathy bates wouldn t reprise her role in the film she wasn t well known off broadway at the time and the producers must have wanted star power i suppose and cast sissy spacek instead sissy did an adequate job in the lead role but did not measure up to kathy bates in any way i love anne bancroft but she seemed too young for this role the movie plot was true to the play anyone who ever contemplates suicide should have to watch this movie to realize the devastation on those who are left behind,0
7004,i could not believe it this film was a total wast of time out of my life the title is appropriate love didn t beat the hell out of me this film did i kept watching and watching and waiting and waiting and hoping for something anything to happen and nothing ever happened nothing terrence howard couldn t even save this lame piece of work called a film it was dark and confused and i didn t get who killed the girlfriend in the end the tone and pacing of the film was supposed to be building to a dramatic climactic ending this only served to confuse the audience because the movie just plodded along going no where if you want pure torture watch this film,0
10787,this is a strong recommendation to anyone who reads this review who has never seen the film total reality don t waste your time and money renting this poor excuse for a film this is without peer the single worst movie that i have ever seen in my life i had nightmares of this movie ever since i saw it the acting was terrible and any amateur film maker could make a more decent film the film blatently rips off far superior sci fi films such as timecop or total recall where the title seems to have been derived from i m sorry but i just think that there is more entertainment value in watching the side of a cardboard box for two hours if you already have seen this movie i feel sorry for you for going through what i did,0
15426,i saw this movie when it first came out in france in my hometown 54 years ago i was nine and today i still remember each black and white frame especially the black ones because it was so tense scary those sneaking attacks through that dark pass in the mountain the two soldiers prisoners forced to fight each other by their captors the last battle with the uncovering of the wagon with the gatling in it firing away the last fight between peck and the chief and the happy end which let me take back my breath i haven t seen it since then and i don t know if it would be a good idea to see it again today it was such a fabulous moment for the kid i was,1
5177,the movie starts out with its most intelligent joke and goes downhill from there pun intended after that there s lots of potty humor and sexual situations the beautiful women were the best part of the movie swear word puns are not meant to be central idea jokes but they try it here the battle between the two groups in the local town richies and poories is an old tried and true setup so how could it go wrong well there is no reason to envy the richies nor any reason to feel sorry for the poories so we can forget the central plot the situational humor is all toilet or sexual aimed at teenagers but only garners giggles no true belly laughs the only thing that salvages the comedy for this movie is the character humor with the blind man providing some rehashed but seldom used setups and the black bar owner providing the formulaic street or hood humor ok forget the jokes there has to be some killer snowboarding shots since this was a commercial enterprise unfortunately there was only 4 seconds of backdrop action that might be inspiring the rest was all b grade tricks or worse the big moment where the main character rides the goat a man killer ski run did provide one shot where a small avalanche eats the stuntman this was the best of the boarding in this movie any serious snowboarding fan will be disappointed with the quality of the stunts in the movie as for the technical aspects of the movie the soundtrack was average which surprises as those snowboarding documentaries are regularly filled with quality tunes you can catch a lot of editing mistakes and even though it was shot on a ski mountain the majority of scenery shots failed to convey any sense of true size overall it might be worth watching if you have managed to turn your brain completely off and you like silicon breasts even then you wont remember a thing from this one two days later snowboarding is still waiting for it s definitive comedy you d do better to watch a snowboarding documentary for sure,0
19550,forgiving the franklins is the best film i have seen in years the acting was fantastic especially mari blackwell who was truly remarkable in the role of peggy lester she brought peggy to life with incredible skill and made her as real as my own next door neighbor i also enjoyed robertson dean in the role of the father he is a true professional and managed to pull off even the most intimate scenes with a rare grace the performances by the entire cast were very good excellent in fact but peggy s role as played by blackwell made the movie the cinematography was beautifully done throughout and was most impressive the only criticism i have to offer is a slight weakness of the ending scenes which were overly drawn out repetitive and a bit too focused on the wrong character i would have liked to see it end on a note of forgiveness but spite of that slight flaw it is very much worth the watching and applause for all involved in the making of it,1
14356,return to me is a movie you will want to own it is a story of inspiration and family love that appeals to all ages the story though seemingly impossible aspires to divine intervention when a man looses his wife in a tragic accident and finds that love again in the woman who receives his wife s heart david duchovny and minnie driver give warm hearted performances as the designated to be lovers who meet by chance but the real story lies in the friends and family around them who love and support them in times of trial carol o connor as minnie driver s grandfather is authentic in every scene bonnie hunt as the friend whose wit and encouragement underlines minnie as a sister is funny yet warm in the scenes especially with james belushi as her husband classic scenes and writing makes this story so enjoyable and touching to watch over and over again thank you for making a movie that demonstrates families and friends as close knit caring people who love each other through difficult times,1
6881,very stark very drab no real drama why not just make a documentary this isn t exactly the passion of joan of arc the only reason for seeing chronicles is to hear the performances i love bach s music and even i found it hard to sit through this misery of a film the great gustav leonhardt plays in two senses of the word bach we don t get much of a sense of him as an actor since he s given so little to do dramatically mostly he gets to walk purposefully or angrily out of various rooms bach s life of course was not an errol flynn movie it was indeed fairly drab and more than a little hard this probably means that the life isn t a terrific candidate for a film the music of course is another story i recommend the stations of bach far more information for one thing and some insight into the music which is after all why bach interests us in the first place,0
4199,tedium as only the french can do it i checked my watch for the first time 7 minutes in and with 143 minutes left i also considered walking out i won t even try to discuss the incoherence of the plot or the inability of the characters to be personable because at about 1 hour in i realized none of this mattered it was not merely self indulgent or pretentious it was a vacuum a soul sucking vacuum this film has no saving grace no enjoyable character nothing funny and nothing sad it isn t smart enough to be drama and there s no moment that s in the slightest bit farcical the most intriguing thing about this movie is how it has managed to get mostly glowing and positive reviews i was tricked by those reviews but you don t have to be gentle reader all i want for christmas is my three hours back,0
3840,how many english 101 student s versions of 1984 must america endure gosh this is a great book but kind of a downer i know i ll write one just like it where everything works out okay i ll also replace orwell s old used up political insights from the thirties with my own insightful informed opinions form the 1970s think think political insight evil politicians i m a genius and there will be clones that they make of themselves for some diabolical reason i ll work on that it ll work no it won t bob sullivan writer of this story this really is all you re fault you could have stopped them early and said guys with our budget and acting abilities i was thinking more romantic comedy or we could move away form taking ourselves so seriously and make a campy spoof this tired familiar genre of movies did you do that though bob no you didn t and you ve had 28 years to think about it i don t mean to be so spiteful i m sorry i yelled at you bob you ve obviously had to live with this mistake a lot longer then i have some blame really should go to ron smith who helped you adapt the screenplay he could have stopped you at any time you were young and naive and he took advantage of you now he wrights the plots for video games and you bob well who knows what you do i m sorry if that sounds harsh bob but that s the way it is you were sold upriver by the hollywood hotshots as if ron wasn t enough michael bay also saw your movie and without even asking for rights or anything added some explosions to your concept and turned it into the island that i think is the most disgusting part of all that with a little eye candy your script could of easily been good enough for a major hollywood production which i d of hated just as much as this movie and not felt sorry for you at all i m sorry things worked this way for you bob ron and michael walked all over you leaving you a withered shell of a man who s height of movie writing greatness will be a joke on mystery science theater 3000 don t focus on that though bob because karma works in mysterious ways and one day they ll pay for what they did to poor little bob sullivan,0
19025,agree that this was one of the best episodes of this show i remember the series well as i was in the florida keys when the show had its debut i was looking through old vcr tapes that were keepers and came across two that had about eight episodes i ended up spending part of christmas night and the next watching these shows the singer was bankie banx saw his name come up on the credits he s from anguilla and owns a beach front bar called the dune preserve he s a longtime friend of jimmy buffett and bankie s classic song still in paradise is featured on the latest buffett cd dvd combo called live in anguilla it is track 12 on cd 1 and 8 on the cd i too would like to someday see this short lived series come out on dvd keep the faith,1
11104,so some people might argue that this can t possible be the worst movie ever made and no it s not i have seen movies with weaker plots worse acting and so on so why do i hate this movie ber alles well it s basically about a man who gets kidnapped for many years and when he comes out he tries to find out who did it and why to get revenge the problem i have with this movie has nothing to do with gore or horror but major spoilers stop reading if you don t want to know our main character basically gets tricked into having sex with his own daughter and he wants to cut out his own tongue so his enemy won t tell her because she didn t know it is so humiliating as he crawls on his knees like a dog in total submission and why did he deserve this because many years ago he saw a brother and a sister have a tender moment in the wrong way he went on and told some people and as a result she commits suicide and viola it s the brother who put our main character through all this just for that i have wondered maybe i hate this movie so much because i think his punishment is way too harsh maybe because i feel this movie doesn t condemn incest but somehow confuses it with love maybe it s because i expected something else end of spoilers believe me nobody deserves what happens to our main character in the end and i m very serious you know how some movies just go under your skin and stay there well i felt goddamn dirty after watching this movie and i really wish i d never seen it it stayed with me for days and some might ask well isn t that the purpose of a good movie the ability to affect us in such ways yes it can be but this movie not only made me sick it made me feel violated,0
11252,the plot of this boils down to ah nuld versus satan and what i remember most about the movie is a lot of explosions gunfire blood noise and let s not forget that flammable satanic urine the story is nonsensical utterly predictable and so full of holes i couldn t take a bit of it seriously stick to rosemary s baby or the exorcist if you want to see a really good devil movie and um well i can t think of any good action movies at the moment probably because they re so far and few between so you re on your own in that category this flick does get a 3 out of 10 rating from me for its camp value and for a pretty good performance by gabriel byrne as that old debbil satan,0
8684,if you can watch a film without worrying about the plot or corny acting then backdraft is definitely the one however if like me you like watching films that you can believe then backdraft has some serious flaws it doesn t offer anything new and there are hundreds of 90 s action films that follow identical formulas whilst not being quite as clunky after two firefights i m thinking this has got to go somewhere else i mean how many big fires are there in one city surely firemen do other things such as getting cats out of trees well i was wrong and the repetition continues again and again up until the end a good aspect of the film is the fire itself well filmed and i must say i felt quite hot while watching it which suggests that two hours of watching fire without a story or acting would have been more suited to my taste,0
21887,for the sake of propaganda during world war ii sherlock holmes was moved into the then present one of the results is sherlock holmes and the secret weapon starring a top holmes basil rathbone along with nigel bruce lionel atwill dennis hoey and kaaren verne it is holmes assignment to deliver a scientist dr franz tobel william post jr and his weapon design to the british government before the germans can get him once the man reaches england however his troubles are just beginning can holmes decode the message dr tobel left before falling into the hands of the vicious moriarity save the weapon and possibly the scientist too this is an effective holmes story set in the atmosphere of switzerland and blackout england the series worked just fine in the present day it was not without its problems but those problems had nothing to do with the time period whose idea was it to make watson an idiot nigel bruce s characterization aided and abetted by the scripts has always been the false note i much prefer the characterization of edward hardwicke in the jeremy brett sherlock holmes series there he s attractive intelligent and a believable companion for holmes in the rathbone series holmes is often condescending and treats watson like the bumbling fool that he is however in this particular film watson has a chance to be quite helpful in several parts i admit to being a complete sap for rathbone s recitation from richard ii this blessed plot this earth this england i can t imagine how much it meant to the brits watching the film in 1942 sherlock holmes really served his purpose,1
22548,i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was it tells the story of custer played by errol flynn during and after his graduation from westpoint although i ve heard that the film isn t very historically accurate hollywood never is i still enjoyed it as i knew little of the real events anyway i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic it brought me close to tears as he and ned sharp arthur kennedy rode to their deaths on little big horn i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child but it wasn t until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was i ll give this film 10 out of 10,1
606,the basic story idea of enchanted april is excellent two very unhappy wives meet and decide to pool their funds to rent an italian villa for a month to further defray costs they get two other strangers to come along what makes it interesting are the relationships both before and during this vacation in particular showing how this beautiful setting actually changes their outlooks on life unfortunately this good idea is totally spoiled by two key performances in the ensemble cast that are so bad that they ruin the film ann harding plays the most important role in the film in a manner that makes her seem ridiculous her doe eyed expression and vacant stares really make you wonder if this isn t a zombie movie or she s just meant to be an idiot and to make it worse reginald owen plays a character so obnoxious and bombastic that i was very close to turning off the film he was that awful and unbelievable i noticed that at least one reviewer gave this movie a 10 which is very very difficult to understand sure the film has great ambiance and a good plot but these two glaringly silly performances cannot be overlooked as they undermine the rest of the picture sorry but this film was aching for a re make,0
4637,well dude where s my car might be at least a novelty as one of few hollywood films that seems to have been written cast filmed edited in less than a day i honestly can t believe this got made or that i allowed my friends to make me sit through the entire thing the jokes are too stupid and predictable to be dumb funny and the actors involved don t seem like they would be capable of pulling off any kind of funny had the script actually provided it oddly enough unlike most mindless slapstick comedies this movie actually has too much plot every scene seems to introduce a new moronic and uninteresting subplot of course they were obviously going for moronic but it doesn t work on any level whatsoever there is only one aspect of this film i enjoyed donkeylips from the old nickalodean show salute your shorts has a very small role this is the role that will turn him into the next richard gere though you just watch,0
20211,i think it s about 3 years ago when i saw this movie accidentally i revisited the info site for it here and immediately i felt good again i remembered seeing this movie and loving life again it showed me i could find love and what do you know i have a boyfriend for a year and a half now and love is definitely there,1
11251,i felt that the film was rushed and the acting was full of holes arnold was good but the main girl was stupid and the guy who played the devil was awful the story was confusing and idiotic the film had no point and was unbelievable the movie is not the worst movie but is not too far away from it overall i was awfully disappointed it could have been alot better my score is a 3 out of 10,0
6600,much like final fantasy if you look at a still shot it doesn t look so bad but when the people start moving it s utterly horrifying uneven jerky motions frightening lack of emotion and lack of a feel of life in the face gives me the creeps the characters do not even appear alive organic i saw a preview screening with my daughter who actually fell asleep she was not at all engaged for the record i thought her to be easily engaged by both pixar esque films as well as a number of the bad 2d films like sinbad the lighting is painful giving the children the appearance of holding a flashlight under their chin at a campfire the lip syncing is bad worse actually than final fantasy i also seriously question having hanks play five characters this was a major distraction throughout the film the role of the conductor is eerie although in a way i just can t pinpoint it reminds me of my father s fake phone voice when greeting clients i think this is why the multiple roles are distracting you are accutely aware that the voice is the same but yet distinctly different it gives each character the feel of being acted as opposed to being real human characters the illusion of reality is broken by the multiple role playing of hanks i ve seen the technique work a la eddie murphy but hanks just can t come close to pulling it off with a voice alone given the horrifying animation i would not waste my money on this wait for the rental,0
1865,whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about lucille ball especially her autobiography i ve never seen so many mistakes in a biopic ranging from her early years in celoron and jamestown to her later years with desi i could write a whole list of factual errors but it would go on for pages in all i believe that lucille ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves if i were lucie arnaz and desi jr i would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film the filmmakers tried hard but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me,0
21563,this film stars peter lorre as an exceptionally nice guy who immigrates to america unfortunately shortly after his arrival he s in a horrible fire and his face is horribly burned because he looks so awful no one wants to hire him and out of sheer desperation he resorts to a life of crime in order to earn the money needed to buy a mask to hide his ugliness where exactly the film goes from there you ll just need to see for yourself i scored this movie an 8 because for the money spent to make it it s a heck of a good film with a lot of good twists in the plot to keep it interesting the film could have degenerated into a simple horror or crime film but it goes far beyond this an offers some genuine surprises in addition the excellent acting by lorre shows that he was capable of more than just supporting roles this is an excellent film and delivers more than most a pictures of the day,1
24165,this delightful movie tells the story of buds and it s incredible you ll laugh and you ll smile and you ll laugh it s really all about the laughs when jon bon jovi is funny in a movie it s a heck of a movie nuff said now go watch it,1
19287,i went to see glenn mcquaid s i sell the dead in it s north american premiere at the toronto after dark film festival seeing as this is the second showing worldwide i didn t quite know what to expect of this film especially having not seen the short film that inspired this big screen adaptation i ll start off with a slightly more elaborate plot synopsis without giving away any spoilers this movie is about arthur blake how he became a grave robber and the interesting and supernatural discoveries that both he and his mentor discovered the costume and set design in this film were excellent i was amazed to hear that the entire film was shot in and around new york the costumes were very accurate to the time really bringing you as a viewer into the mindset of the time this movie works just as well as a period piece as it does a horror comedy the interaction between the two leads was very fluid they played off each others acting with ease the dialogue between the two was very well written with glenn adding his comedic touch even in tense situations the story is very encompassing and the ball gets rolling from the very start i d compare it to a visual page turner always wondering just what will happen next the characters themselves are all very vivid and unique adding different emotional layers to the film itself all in all i recommend this film for anyone in the mood for some dark humour with a bit of horror mixed in 9 10,1
18043,i really felt the movie was ahead of its time the one potential daughter in law was such a strong career oriented woman she knew what she wanted and was diplomatic but firm with the over bearing mother in law to be the mother s role was played extremely well you just loved to hate her her need to control her son s lives was neurotically evil if you ve ever been in a relationship where you ve been judged and found lacking and everybody involved knew it this may hit too close to home it s been years since i saw this movie and i remember thinking that this plot and dialog would work in a 50 s or 60 s movie it is difficult to watch because of the mother and sons dynamic but i would love to watch it again i keep hoping to find it on one of the old movie channels but so far no luck attempts to buy it were also futile i don t believe it s on tape or dvd,1
21667,i decided to write a comment on this amazing movie because here on imdb it is cited that john woo a mediocre director who made some decent films back in his pre american years but totally ruined his reputation by his latest made in us films plans to remake it well here are a couple of reasons why it is one of the stupidest ideas for a remake ever the plot of the film is simple and even clich d by today s standards but what makes the film a masterpiece is acting by the four leads unique direction by mellville cinematography music and its style there is no way any director today can make such film it is impossible to create such an atmosphere in a movie in today s box office targeted movie business john woo did make a more or less decent film which borrowed from melville s le samourai the killer but remember it was made when the director was not spoiled by big budgets and expensive in salaries but cheap in acting merits actors so what i m saying is that this is one of the greatest films ever made together with another film by melville le samourai watch it and even if the remake will be made try to avoid it before seeing the great original first,1
3506,a scientific experiment designed to create a superhuman being has gone wrong the creators become trapped in a remote desert outpost pursued relentlessly and mercilessly by their own creation james stockton the scientist whose research was used despite his protests to create the monster is called the outpost to help undo the horror that now lurks somewhere within the dark halls james together with his son and daughter soon find themselves trapped inside with the others trying desperately to survive and with the outpost sealed from within there is no way out the outpost mind ripper is highly unoriginal the sets are pretty claustrophobic and there s a bit of gore however as a horror it fails miserably on almost all levels there s zero suspense the script is weak and filled with big holes and the ending is extremely predictable so called master wes craven produced this one i wonder if he is happy with this trash joe gayton directs without any style the acting is horrible only lance henriksen can act at all ok i m a big horror fan and was bitterly disappointed avoid it like the plague it s just the same old boring crap again,0
7270,well don t bother this film looks so tired the acting is so old fashioned and the plot and characters so drab that it should be studied instead of watched it is really a horrible waste of film stereotypes clich s nonsense and amateurish film making i watched it in unbelievable awe with my mouth wide open how could such a film be made and more interestingly how could anyone find it funny or watchable old tired sloppy a junior high skit at best there is nothing watchable there except for a study of very ancient film not good film just ancient this is not abbott and costello or laurel and hardy this is nonsense the acting is so bad that maybe it is worth it to watch just for the laugh some films are so bad that they are good but this one goes all the way around the corner and back to bad again,0
12033,i watched this film a few nights ago and it was awful awfully long even though they managed to skip through the majority of his life awfully boring the parts they included were long winded and for some reason the director chose to cut away from some of the action and left huge parts of the film unexplained awfully inaccurate the whole mystical side to this film was a joke and last time i checked ghengis khan wasn t exactly a nice guy awfully acted i found several of the characters hard to believe they were very two dimensional and lacked and kind of depth a saving grace of the film was the cinematography that is why i gave this film a 2 star rating rather than the bare minimum however if you want to look at something pretty i would recommend buying a picture instead all in all this film was an awful waste of my time and money please do yourself a favour and give this mongolian turkey a miss,0
2782,no offense to anyone who saw this and liked it but i hated it it dragged on and on and there was not a very good plot also too simple and the acting was so so i would give this snorefest a 2 at the most,0
11260,from the portrayals of andy warhol in the films i shot andy warhol and basquiat this is the type of movie i would predict andy warhol might make airy illogical snobbish amoral the movie s almost non existent plot which is sometimes increduously unbelievable is offset by the movie s rough real looking cinematography the film has a way of being unreal yet dictating reality to the viewer the only worthwhile part of the movie is the development of the relationship between joe and holly and every thing in it should be viewed as a characterization device there are a couple of comical scenes that i do admit are funny but trash is really just about a character study of unengaging people that is mildly enjoyable if you do not mind watching nudity and i v drug use,0
21916,this is a great film with an amazing cast crispen glover is at his freakiest his guitar solo is amazing also watch out for a cameo by william burroughs truly a cult classic this is on my top ten list don t miss this twisted film,1
8989,armed and dangerous is not one of the greats of john candy this film about a fired cop who ends up working for a small security system run by the mob is very weak and not very much a comedy there are some moments that i did enjoy like looking at candy in a pilot suit but it doesn t seem to matter much armed and dangerous is still a dangerously disappointing dud brought to us by the director of the equally dumb actioner commando what a sad excuse for a comedy 1 out of 5,0
15598,i m amazed that of all the reviews i ve looked at nobody seems to have noticed one of the main points of this film or at least how i saw it it seems like one big homosexual fantasy camp clothing a glorified nude ferdinand a definite sexual tension between ariel and prospero and as a final climax a group of men in tight sailor suits dancing the hornpipe this whole approach once you get used to it provides you with all sorts of fantastic scenes and images the sight of an innocent ariel being pulled towards a disgusting nude sycorax in order to perform her earthy and abhorr d commands is one of the darkest i ve ever scene in a shakespeare film however by the end of the film i d grown tired of the style and the final hornpipe dance was just too much to take still overall its an interesting interpretation of the play,1
19971,another black comedy that won an oscar for best screenplay starring george c scott this redefines the phrase tearing a new a hole in this case the target is america s medicare and grand hospital system throughout the hospital patients and doctors are dying because their names and prescriptions are being changed scott roars screams and blasts away his workers and bosses as they fail more and more his comment about dachau to one of his many bosses is sure to elicit laughs he even beats and rapes a hippie 3 times this is one that has to be seen and heard as the monologues and soliloquies are the key points in the film,1
3744,a washed up reporter called bart crosbie pat o brien blackmails gang boss heinz webber george colouris for the money to pay for his son to have a life saving operation in return he agrees to turn himself in for the murder of his editor whom the gang killed in order to prevent an incriminating story being printed about them typical poverty row b pic of the time directed for far more than it s worth by terence fisher who within months of making this would become one of the leading british horror film directors at the hammer studio the script is far fetched and teen idol tommy steele guitar in hand was drafted in to sing a poor rock and roll number called the rebel at a coffee bar that acts as a legitimate front for the gang s activities,0
3854,in the ring it was a videotape a website was the problem in feardotcom the danger in pulse came from computers and phone and one missed call featured you guessed it deadly phones in stay alive the piece of technology that causes all manner of problems is an online game those who play it wind up dead soon afterwards how clever directed by william brent bell who and featuring an unimpressive cast of twenty somethings that you might have seen before but probably can t remember where or what the hell their names are this is an extremely derivative piece of film making aimed squarely at the pg 13 horror set seasoned scary film watchers will no doubt find stay alive extremely tedious highly predictable and not in the least bit frightening the poorly developed plot follows a group of gamers with extremely daft names october loomis phineus hutch and swink who attempt to unravel the mystery behind the deadly game before they too become victims eventually they discover that it is the evil spirit of the legendary countess elizabeth bathory who is killing anyone who dares to play and that their only hope of survival is to continue with the game to the end with a story as dumb as this viewers should expect a film with loose ends aplenty not one iota of logic who made the game how and why is never explained very little in the way of scares or gore and a dumb closing scene to leave the door open for god forbid a sequel,0
11516,after watching this film i thought to myself they really glossed up errol flynn s life the movie is really nice eye candy they really got the 1930s and 1940s atmosphere of hollywood just right the costumes were great all the women looked glamorous and all the men looked handsome and debonair is this a serious film about errol flynn s life nah it s a fun movie based on all the scandalous stuff he did in his life why am i critiquing this film this is a film that had a lot of promise but failed to deliver duncan reagher was really good as errol flynn he was not as good looking as the original but he made you believe that flynn was not just a handsome playboy who did not take himself seriously but as a man who although gifted with great talent was kind of disturbed and unhappy inside flynn s love life was a disaster considering he had so many failed marriages he also lost a lot of good friends during his life he also suffered from unrequited love for the elegant olivia dehavilland the last scene of the film showed errol kind of begging for olivia to stay with him and instead she walks away he is shown in his tux looking really empty and slowly walking around the pool as he pours his drink into the pool it was a sad way to end the film but kind of fitting because everyone knows by now how he eventually fell apart from his alcoholism and his dissipated lifestyle this film could ve had much more depth could ve been better well written sure they showed all the scandals but they never showed errol flynn s human center surprisingly duncan reagher was able to put some emotional depth into the character of errol flynn even though the film writing didn t put any depth there i ll probably never see this film again but i can still remember after viewing this film gosh this could ve been so much more i give this film a d,0
18481,billy wilder continues his strong run of films during the 1950s with a biopic of charles lindbergh the young american pilot who became the first man to fly solo across the atlantic in 1927 jimmy stewart plays lindbergh and while he might be a bit too old for the part he still brings the sincere warmth and confidence needed as well as his trademark down to earth goodness that makes him an iconic film star wilder directs solidly balancing the background story with humor and drama to give us a clear description of what lindbergh was up against when he decided to take this challenge it certainly isn t his nor stewart s best work but it is a gem of a movie it lifts your spirits with the plane and makes you proud to be an american overall it is just plain good,1
17987,gary cooper and a marshal change identities since they both agree cooper would be more efficient facing the outlaws what is remarkable in this film are the costumes both the marshal s and steve cochran s who is the bad guy cochran wears his guns backwards probably to be able to crossdraw the film starts quite excitingly with a showdown with wild bill hickok ruth roman looking very pretty is the marshal s fiancee there is plenty of action never a dull moment but you have to concentrate because the story is a bit complicated good entertainment,1
11672,well i have to agree with the critics on this one who all said leave it alone why they had to make this re make of the 1960 psycho i don t know my guess is they wanted to reach a new audience and thought color and modern day actors were the answer since those were the main changes the dialog was the same and the story the same on one hand i applaud them for not making this over with a lot of profanity and nudity and making it a sleazy film yet if they were going to keep everything the same why bother when you weren t going to improve on tony perkins janet leigh and the original cast did they honestly think vince vaughn was going to be as good or better than perkins are you kidding ann heche with her short mannish haircut is going to be better than leigh i don t think so yes the colors were pretty in here but it s the black and white photography that helped make the 1960 version so creepy to begin with it s perfect for the story not a bunch of greens and pinks once again i guess the filmmakers were banking on an audience that never saw the original this was just a stupid project that never should have gotten off the ground,0
11818,any one who writes that this is any good there kid may have worked on it or put money in to this god awful college experiment it was lousy slow and painful to watch running time of only about 84 minutes it felt like three and half hours the only person to blame is the director who knows nothing on how to direct a scene where to place the camera 95 of this dreadful movie was shoot by long master shots two or three people in the frame talking or yelling forever or what seems like forever no close ups no medium shots there are two so called fight scenes that any filmmaker with a brain would have shoot some close ups or medium shoots for them they looked very amateurish the scenes with the father and son screaming at each other would have worked better if there was a cut away of just the father or just the son acting or reacting tri c must be very mortified to show this any where i have seen a bunch of bad movies in my time some of them are fun because they so bad this is not one of them,0
11023,apparently in early 2005 scifi channel threatened to release the incriminating photos they have of john rhys davies and said we need you to star in another scifi original the scary thing is he s actually pretty damn good in this movie that s really saying something since this is a silly scifi creature feature you ve gotta put some feeling into it in order to be well acted unfortunately nobody else does it s your stereotypical moster run amok movie on a cruise ship the cryptozoologist wants to keep the creature alive the navy seals think they have everything under control but they don t know what they re dealing with and they all end up dead a girl jumps into the movie sexpot role as rhys davies daughter and the creature mauls about 100 or so shipmates what this movie has going for it is it s very fast paced and lively you re never bored or waiting for another kill other than that though it does nothing to distinguish itself and it s silly that this thing crawls all over the ceilings and can t be wounded by navy seal machine guns but can be karate kicked into submission by rhys davies daughter kinda went back and forth on giving this bad boy a 5 but for the above silliness i m giving it a 4,0
9865,this hbo original is pretty straightforward and pretty dumb armand assante once again doing a poor stallone imitation is ray wellman a ex con just out on parole all he wants is his old girlfriend lacy played by a young marcia gay harden back unfortunately for ray lacy has hooked up with stalwart elliot played by sam neill further complicating matters is that ray s old cell buddies want some favors and they kidnap lacy to make sure they happen ray and elliot team up despite mutual dislike what follows is violent and slow but marcia gay harden shows us why she would win oscar in the future she s not as polished here but her raw emotion sincerity and some rather explicit nude scenes almost make this worth watching almost rent fever no the title doesn t fit the film if your a fan of hers otherwise skip it and be grateful it s stars went on to better things note this is a hard r flick for language violence and nudity,0
15785,i m a fan of independent film dialogue driven character study pieces are where it s at for me some of the other posts are right wannabes isn t going to rival the godfather for best mob film ever on the other hand wannabes is a well written and well directed picture that has surprisingly good performances from every actor actress my problem with one of the other reviews conor dubin stands out as the only irishman in a cast of italians dubin is a jewish last name and as such has a dark complexion not a traditional ruddy one of an irishman he doesn t stand out at all rather delivers a great performance this didn t win many awards but it is deserving of a saturday night with a bowl of popcorn i found it for 7 bucks at blockbuster and was pleasantly surprised to say the least highly recommended,1
19774,if you are french native then you find this movie extremely funny it s good just good can though imagine that subtitles or translations don t mean much in english,1
5387,i don t mind the odd artsy film but when they are larded with arcane symbolism and murky dialogue and when it s obvious they were done for the filmmaker s ego rather than the viewer s benefit i get upset i m not a stupid person yet i simply didn t understand what this film was trying to say or do film is a magnificent form of human communication why do some filmmakers use it instead for obfuscation,0
17729,i read the book in a summer book club and all of us there loved it my friends from that club agreed not to watch the movie lest the book be ruined i didn t agree and watched it recently with my younger brother and my parents i was pleasantly surprised the movie was very true to the book without losing it s own spirit the new kid theme was shown just enough so that we get a feel of it but that s not what the story s about the acting wasn t the best i ve ever seen but it was still good and the kids especially had a lot of energy the characters were interesting and the plot was cute and not too overstated it was a kids movie that works just fine for adults or teenagers too i wish there had been a bit more tough girl attitude from beatrice but she was still a great character mullet fingers was quite a bit like i had imagined him except his hair was a little obviously dyed with blonde hair and dark eyebrows roy worked very well as the little guy and the new kid especially interactions with his parents and friends the message and the ending which i won t discuss other than i liked it teamed up to make a great cheer up movie for a rainy day all in all this was a great film that you can watch again and again whenever you need reminding that the world isn t a horrible place after all,1
3152,i m accustomed to being patient with films because i ve generally found it usually pays off but a few works take tedium to new levels and enter the realm of provocation last year at marienbad comes to mind well pola x ain t no last year at marienbad i can count on one hand the number of films i ve walked out on over the years pola x achieved membership in that august group in my defense i believe i made a valiant effort to stand my ground hoping things would turn around however i finally threw in the towel just shy of the 90 minute mark quite respectable under the circumstances pola x does not come anywhere near living up to the promise of carax s earlier work after a 10 year hiatus that must have been bitter for him indeed melville is still spinning in his grave,0
21988,its such a shame that an important film like this is virtually unknown i don t think alan bates has done a better film than this its never shown on television the only time i can recall it being shown on british tv was in the summer of 1998 i have it on tape but sadly the quality isn t great due to a dodgy aerial at the time i remember wanting to see this film for some time before it appeared on tv it was shown on channel 4 in the early hours of the morning thereby ensuring that it still remained unseen except for a very small audience i was living in bristol at the time and it was ironic that when i finally saw the film i realised that i had walked past the very house where it was filmed several times before the film treads a fine line a married couple attempting to make light of their tragic predicament of coping with their severely mentally handicapped daughter by laughing about it and even involving the child in their jokes the direction and the acting are so superb that the film is always compassionate and moving and is never in danger of lapsing into bad taste a couple of years ago i saw a clip of the filmed theatre production with eddie izzard in the role of bri and victoria hamilton playing sheila it showed izzard improvising and larking about and hamilton jokingly telling the audience to ignore him when he s being like this i maybe taking this out of context as i only saw a brief clip but having read the play and seen the film this is clearly such a delicate subject that such an approach is both insensitive and disrespectful izzard was praised for his performance but i felt uncomfortable with what i saw it is perhaps surprising that such a successful play failed to find an audience when it was finally filmed this is one of the best british films of the 70s and hopefully it will be released on dvd one day,1
7554,all the airport movies are stinkers but this one is the biggest turkey of them all the formula was different for this one because it focused on two disastrous flights and a lot of plot occurring on the ground while the other movies focused on just one disastrous flight and less plot on the ground the stunts with the concorde are worth watching for the laughs although the special effects aren t as terrible as i d expect for a movie of this quality made in 1979 george kennedy s sexist remarks are disgusting and his rendezvous with a prostitute in paris is totally unnecessary and made me gag a little poor martha raye was relegated to a role where she did nothing but relieve her bowel over and over in the concorde s bathroom there are no big stars in this movie compared to the previous films giving you one more reason not to watch this one,0
1267,this is the worst movie i have ever seen and believe me i ve sen a lot of bad movies i love cheeesy horror but this was just terrible there was not one scene in this film where i felt scared all the actors must have been people that they found at a bus stop 20 minutes prior to shooting i wish that blockbutser would have given me my 99 cents back the acting was terrible the writing was incredibly bad someone had to screen this movie before it was released and had to know that it was terrible i d be embarrassed to have my name associated with this monstrosity don t rent this movie if you do don t return it so no other poor souls will ever make the mistake of renting it,0
7561,i gave airport 79 only two stars because it s a truly lousy film nobody who had anything to do with it deserves any praise except for charo s chihuahua who does a pretty good job in his role this is not to say that the film isn t worth watching it helps if you have a buzz on but this is not essential a 79 really does seem like an early version of airplane every scene has a set up and a payoff and the scenes blunder after one another as if they were totally disconnected one of my favorite recurring points is that the passengers crew and airplane get to keep going no matter what you re a news reporter and a strange guy gets murdered at your house in your presence the hit man then chases you onto your greenhouse roof no problem you can still catch that early morning flight to paris no need to get the cops involved your plane dodges one unmanned drone missile four heat seeking missiles and cannon fire from an unidentified phantom fighter doing barrel rolls an unpowered dive and a crash net landing without thrust reversers in the process no problem we ll have the mechanics check the oil and get you on your way in just a few hours it s truly funny and i ll admit that there s a bit of the anarchist in me that comes out when the passengers pay no attention to the cabin attendants the highlight is when the attendant tells jimmie walker he ll have to put away his saxophone god spare me from a flight seated in front of a saxophonist playing jazz prior to take off jimmie basically says nope later in the flight the sax is damaged during a barrel roll and jimmie actually shows up on the next leg of the flight with yet another sax that he won t put away this aspect of the film is just fun one passenger actually obeys the attendant when charo is told she can t take her dog on the flight she leaves the plane naturally this is because you can t get a good view of her ass and boobs while she s seated in summary a terrible movie but terrible enough to be a bit amusing unfortunately the filmmakers and cast deserve no credit whatsoever for this as it was probably entirely unintentional,0

11589,i am currently watching this movie and i have absolutely no hesitation in reviewing it now the acting is ridiculous half the cast must be retired porno actors and to get kicked off pornos you could imagine the quality of acting the graphics are unlike anything i have ever seen i think there are puppet shows with more believability they can t even afford blanks for the guns they shoot at the pathetic excuse for monsters perhaps i should also note how incredibly impressed i am at the number of bullets their pistols can hold if asked to summarise the movie i would say that someone had rustled up a group of complete no hopers at the local county fair slapped them on an island added needlessly intense music and let a 6 year old do the editing i can honestly not formulate any possible explanation for why this movie was released recorded on dvd and costs 6 from my local video store for one day if anything i have received the benefit of knowing that i am a lot smarter than all parties involved in this film i hate this movie with great intensity why i wish i knew captain i wish i knew,0
15179,i m astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of black snake moan it s not about black white relationships or old young relationships though i think director craig brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos it s not about sexual abuse or sex addiction though christina ricci s character rae typifies those it s not about folk religion in the black community though religion plays a large role it s not a love story though there are not one but two happy couples at the end and it s certainly not about the south where everything is hotter though it s set in the south and it s undeniably hot holy smokes even the tag line writers didn t get the point black snake moan is a parable about mississippi delta blues who feels them who writes them who plays them what they re playing about how it heals them it s as though the film producers sat down with a blank slate and asked ok if we were going to help people understand what the blues are really about what would it look like so they set it in the rural south then they dream up two characters one whose wife left him to live with his best friend the other who goes off to war and his badly abused girl sleeps with everybody in town then we throw in grizzled worldliness touched just a little by folk religion they know jesus wants their lives and though they respect him they know they can t give him that some violence between men and women and lots and lots of steamy sexual images including ready to go over the top a black man in a sleeveless undershirt holding a half naked white girl captive on the end of a 40 lb chain fill it with authentic delta blues sounds make it about a genuine blues picker use music as the main healing element in the plot slap clips of blues man son house on both ends and voila you have a modern parable about what the blues are all about even the film s climax is not character conflict but the whole town dancing steamy dances to hot raunchy blues of course there s a bit of a dilemma here rae ricci is being destroyed by uncontrollable lust and is being healed by lazarus jackson s homey religion and steadfastness and don t forget the chain but then we re shown the restored rae dancing raunchily to blues at the end is this an expression of a restored healthy life force or just more of the same trashy behavior that ruined her in the first place brewer wants it both ways but blues really is about sex and violence not to mention depression i suppose he would say blues gives healthy expression to both sex and violence without unleashing either i have my doubts not for the first time samuel l jackson plays so well that we forget we re watching samuel l jackson the man is unbelievably good he even picks some of his own tunes in the film and his playing is authentic dirty and hot christina ricci isn t usually this good either granted half her job is done by the costume that wasn t there and her slinky figure but she s a marvelous combination of cynical lust rebellion and vulnerability bravo to her she s arrived i was impressed by the country preacher john cothran jr i had to check the database to assure myself that he s a professional actor and not a genuine country minister parents need to be aware of what they re getting if their kids bring this one home the language is pretty far off the charts the first half hour is full of graphic sex and women are violated in a dozen ways during the course of the film lazarus means well and is decent but honestly chaining a woman to the radiator plus ricci spends half the movie dressed for sex if you ve got teenage boys they ll be licking the screen halfway into the film i don t recommend this for kids of any age adults only please that being said black snake moan is informative and accurate about blues folk religion and sexual abuse and tells a tale that s redemptive in lots of ways it s unorthodox but well worth the time and my goodness is the sound track hot,1
2219,margaret mitchell spins in her grave every time somebody watches this mess fine costuming and sets can t even begin to overwhelm lackluster performances by joanne whalley as the title character and the ever bland timothy dalton as rhett even worse than the acting and perhaps partially explaining it is the script which is astoundingly cliched and predictable add to that hellishly bad script a score that ll have you cringing and you ve got a disaster i wouldn t wish on any viewer scarlett is just amazingly lousy and i can t imagine how it ever got made much less made it to video,0
5951,i cannot believe i actually set up a season pass on my tivo for this apparently they had a good preview or something i can t imagine it though after seeing about 5 minutes i thought to myself why am i watching this it is definitely not reality and some of the worst acting i have ever seen on television i am a total addict of reality tv and there is nothing real about this the acting if you can call it that is awful the only ones that are almost 5 decent are the girls that are meant to draw viewers to the show although they would need to be a lot prettier to save this train wreck if they would have more lines they would probably change my mind as they probably have no talent either this is obviously a very low budget production with actors who are apparently very cheap there is no way they could get a job in anything else someone needs to direct these people to a job in food service maybe they could do that oh and by the way parco p i no longer occupies any space on my tivo or tivo s season pass list definitely the worst show i ve ever seen,0
6469,the role of buddy ackerman is no stretch for kevin spacey he s played version of that character many times other better films this is fortunate because it gives his performance a certain resonance without which buddy would be as flat and incomplete as all of the other characters in this pointless little farce the script leaves little time for plot or character development resembling a porn flick in its rush to get to the good stuff the difference is that here the good stuff isn t people pleasuring each other but inflicting pain making it appropriate viewing for young adults of course there s nothing wrong with a porn flick if you want to watch people having sex and i guess there s nothing wrong with swimming with sharks if you want to watch people undergoing physical emotional and psychological torture but if you re looking for incisive satire interesting characters or anything else that even attempts to engage more than your basest passions you should probably look elsewhere,0
5301,a terminally dull mystery thriller which may sound pretty sound theoretically but plays out very poorly the ludicrous script is full of minor spoiler people dying and then coming back to life when the plot requires them to and the director doesn t seem able to work up any energy and suspense the gooey sequence that kind of explains the film s title is the only halfway memorable one in this tiresome film 1 2,0
13861,i would just like to point out in addition to pleading for the series to be released on dvd that a show does not have to be realistic to be entertaining these days with all the blood and gore in the news and in crime dramas reality shows etc it s nice to get lost in a good cheesy show with entertaining characters pwog fits the bill was it emmy material no but it was awesome just the same i also have to put a vote in for the second cast they were more charismatic than the cast of season one i would definitely agree that the first season had a more serious vibe than the second two but i was definitely more sucked in by the latter cast even though the series has been off the air for years i ll never stop hoping that it be released for purchase,1
12149,i thought that this movie might be a good spoof or at least a good independent comedy like friday instead it was more like something someone in high school would make with their parents camcorder it wasn t just the low budget that makes this film bad many great films have been made on a low budget it is simply a bad movie and it wasn t even bad enough to be good camp case in point for the first ten minutes of the movie nothing happens except the 3 main characters sit in their room smoking dope put on their makeup and then answer a phone call you keep waiting for something to get story moving but it never comes the sound was so bad i had to turn the tv up all the way just to almost make out what they were saying which wasn t interesting anyways if i pay to rent a movie i will usually suffer through it even when it s bad but it was all i could do to sit through 20 minutes it looks like the person before me felt the same way because they didn t rewind the tape and left off about the same place i did the only reason i gave this a score of 1 is because the rating system doesn t have negative numbers,0
10492,slight spoilers this installment of the full moon franchise changes the storyline a bit and implements some new elements first off a new puppet master is established secondly the puppets turn good in this sequel finally it introduces some scifi fantasy elements as well a new tenant of the infamous hotel by the bay his girlfriend her psychic friend and that psychics boyfriend stumble upon andre toulon s puppet trunk they also learn about some demon from another dimension that holds toulon responsible for stealing the secret to animating the unliving so sutekh the demon sends the totems a bunch of craven little creatures that look like ear less gremlins then it s up to the puppet troupe to take care of the inter dimensional threat that s trying to kill there new friends like most low budget movies this film is rife with continuity problems how did the puppets get put back in the trunk how come nobody remembers the last rasche of killngs in the hotel who bought the hotel why would a contractor by a building with a history of mass murders all this and many more questions will not be answered ever the real suprise of this movie is the acting it s actually pretty good the actors take it with a enthusiasm unusual especially for a bunch of full moon nonames teresa hill was especially impressive as the shy nervous psychic lauren chandra west susie was also a pleasant suprise also gordon hill was a tolerable protagonist but cameron was far too annoying to stomach thank the norse god he dies before halfway through the puppets are there usual animated selves with some improvements as well there emotions especially jester s are much more human due to the sounds that have been given to them blade s hisses pinhead s grunts and six shooter s snicker have all been improved and sound much better the stop motion animation is only average at best especially the totems they just don t seem to move as fluidly as the previous installment in the series also the sutekh costume is absolutely awefull how are we supposed to afraid of a creature so humorous looking the story seems a bit juvinile for the series i think charlie band was looking to focus in on a younger demographic the violence being toned down in this movie also seems to speak the same gore fans will be disappointed i think the above is the main problem this movie can t really stick with many people it doesn t have the violence for gorewhores the language is a little cleaner yet it s too violent and harsh for the wee ones which is why the movie gets low ratings i have to say that the common reviews are mostly fair,0
17696,it was good to see john denver again though he passed several years ago i found this film to be very heartwarming and a great film to sit by the fire on a cold winters night recollecting what christmas is all about the scenes of georgetown colorado were magnificent and make one want to move there immediately as i sit here in my own mountain seen in so california i loved the story and the plot i hope all who see this somewhat older film enjoy it as much as my mother and i did merry christmas a great film for all the family too see enoy and tell others about it thanks for the memories we need to have more films like this come out of hollywood,1
10173,first of all i have nothing against christianity i believe every person has the right to believe what he or she chooses but i cannot imagine how dumb a person has to be to believe this what a waste of believers money they d better use it to feed some starving families in the third world countries i don t want to talk about talk acting or plot of this movie because i couldn t find any of those in this story s simple two reporters one a is atheist the other b for some sake has abandoned religion b regains his confidence in religion and teaches a a lesson believe in christ or go to hell this message appears after like ten minutes and keeps repeating to the end of the movie people do not believe the rating of this movie read reviews first i didn t and wasted an hour of my life ps why is it classified as sci fi because of those few weird sounds and a bit of bright light from the sky pps u f o satan s evil doings that s a new one,0
574,i must be honest i like romantic comedies but this was not what i had hoped for i thought ellen degeneres was having the biggest part which should have been because i didn t like the two struggling bed partners it was awful poor tom selleck he had to act with someone who was that much in the picture while it should have been him and ellen to be in most of the film they were the only believable ones and the only really funny parts starred them not kate capshaw and that everett guy cool that mummy is coming out of the closet i thought that was a nice surprise i m just glad i saw it on the cable and i didn t pay any money renting it,0
13217,i watched this expecting to see the usual british stiff upper lip stereotypes and was surprised to find the dialogue remarkably natural and tinged with black humour it was more like eastenders goes to sea than in which we serve the scenes during the approach and attack are remarkably realistic in their depiction of a fighting ship and the stuff ups and banter among the ship s company well at least based on my service in the 1970s some of the throwaway lines are very witty i m not joining the band of hope just to please some greasy fish fryer my only complaint is that they didn t show what happened to the irish coxswain and his bride to be or the tattooed po and his i love arabella tattoo,1
21957,crossfire is a justifiably famous 1947 noir that s a murder mystery with a strong message it stars robert young robert mitchum robert ryan sam levene and gloria grahame and is strongly directed by edward dmytryk we witness the murder in shadow at the beginning and for the rest of the film young as the detective finlay in charge of the case seeks to figure out which of three soldiers is responsible for the death and just as important why the victim joseph samuels sam levene is someone the soldiers meet in a bar they go up to his apartment to continue their visit and samuels winds up dead i don t know about 1947 but seeing crossfire today one knows who did it and why the minute we see the suspects i don t suppose it was so apparent back then as these actors were just getting started nevertheless the film packs a big punch with its powerful acting good direction violence and unsparing anti semite language the characterizations are vivid including that of gloria grahame in a smallish role she s a woman who meets mitchell george cooper one of the suspect soldiers in a bar and can provide him with an alibi the big performance in the film belongs to robert ryan but everyone is excellent robert young especially is effective as a tough but intelligent police detective mitchum is very likable as a soldier trying to help his confused friend mitchell a lonely man unsure if he still has feelings for his wife truly excellent and a must see,1
10470,i m not sure if this is a comedy or not but i found it pretty comical isobel is possessed by the devil somehow a perverted priest and the gardener are gonna fix that part exorcism and part soap opera you ll at least get some laughs there s the paranoid jealous dad satanic sister valley of the dolls mother and then the cowboy boyfriend all there to help the skirt chasing priest fight the demons from dear isobel it sometimes felt like a jerry springer episode but i actually paid to see this instead of the cool head twisting sailor cursing and crucifix humping that regan did in the exorcist you get a lot of isobel bouncing on her bed like it s a trampoline hiding in her closet and jumping from a hay loft yeah it s chuck e cheese gone wild so if you want to watch a quote unquote horror film that is worth a few laughs while you wait for the predictable ending this is your movie,0
8007,this movie is recommended only for insomniacs it will relieve them by putting them to sleep five year olds might also enjoy it but for anyone else including fans of the genre what a bore the ancient plot is reminiscent of return of the dragon and this film is just as inept but nero is no bruce lee so enter the ninja is an even worse film until now this is the second the offensive comedy bachelor party was the first film i gave 1 10 to,0
8050,why remake the original assault to my mind assault was carpenter s true masterpiece it had all the elements good carpenter movies contain external threat on a small group of individuals people taking the challenge because they are forced to do so isolation just remember the guns in carpenter s original made no sound being thus a lot more threatening than conventional devices and now this remake concentrating on main character i s psychology and on his relation to main character ii the evil but honorable the anonymous threat in the carpenter movie replaced by a rather conventional conspiracy corruption background the remakers just didn t understand the main plot of the original and thus produced something pretty ordinary,0
9949,this movie is supposed to take place in milford nj i know the house that it is based on as well as the person as you see at the end of themovie she was killed in the world trade center incident i know that because i was one of the police officers that helped with the identification of her remains she was the only one in our area lost the nudity in the movie went a bit far i am not a prude but the actors could have filmed the scene with the two woman without actually showing the whole thing this movie is in poor taste and i cannot see how her family would give there blessing to it this is an insult to the person whom it is based on,0
11494,to put it simply this was a pompous piece of canine poopie overly stagey and everyone being the total melodramatic drama queen at every single moment after a while i was starting to wish that every character in the movie wasn t such a stuffed up anal retentive and this movie has another one of those truly annoying things that has recently come into vogue and shouldn t have all the scenes are in a sort of washed out blue steel greyishness hmmm the last time i checked candles and torches are quite capable of putting a fairly wide spectrum of colors in fact the light they put out tends to be more in the warmish yellowish orange range of the spectrum so where s all the blue steel grey light coming from this movie has fancy sets and glitzy cgi fx but it s still dreck it s pathetic junk put out for today s movie goers who are easily placated by pathetic junk i very much enjoy vampires and werewolves as movie plot devices but this was a total hack job universal studios 1941 the wolfman is infinitely superior to this even though its fx is pretty primitive compared to what could be done nowadays i m done with this franchise the first movie was reasonably decent the second still somewhat entertaining but this one i couldn t even finish all the way to the end because it was so boring,0
15421,after a summer full of retreads and disappointments nurse betty is a breath of fresh air the film is like no other i have ever seen director neil labute proves that he can direct more then disturbing pictures of men and women and how they approach sex his previous two films were the brillant in the company of men and the almost brillant your friends and neighbors renee zellweger gives the best performance of her career as betty a waitress who when she witnessing the brutal death of her asshole husband labute mainstay aaron eckhart and gets lost in a fantasy world morgan freeman and chris rock play the hitmen who killed her husband and are now on her trial the trick to the film is that freeman and zellweger are really parallel characters while zellweger falls in love with the image of the handsome and polite dr dave ravell on a soap opera freeman idealizes betty nurse betty is a brillant film full of life humor love and graphic violence my grade 10 10,1
1645,explores the frontiers of extreme boredom life in a small canadian town in winter as an experiment in extreme sensory deprivation absolutely nothing happens as viewed through the eyes of a blank deadpan totally uninteresting protagonist viewers of this film should be prepared to hallucinate in the style of altered states in a groundbreaking study david snowden found that he could predict alzheimer s thirty years in advance by comparing the autobiographical essays of nuns as they entered the convent those who eventually suffered the disease wrote in simple direct prose the essays were quiet and contemplative with little optimism or episodes of joy now why did i mention that perhaps my mind begins to slowly unravel watching this interminable autobiographical contemplative film which shows in simple direct style the bleak and stoic life of a small community living next to giant slag heaps of asbestos this film became popular at the height of the quebec separatist movement because of its presentation of this community as permanently wounded victims tragically its writer director was soon diagnosed with alzheimer s disease in the early 1980s and apparently committed suicide,0
5109,this movie was beyond disappointment well acted story that means nothing the plot is ridiculous and even what story there is goes absolutely nowhere it truly isn t worth a nickel buffalo or otherwise pun intended,0
18760,i saw this film in wales in july it deals with the courage of czech pilots who flew numerous missions for the raf after their country had been occupied by the nazis in this film the action takes place both in the early 1950 s when these pilots are being beaten in political prisons in czeckoslavakia and during world war ii in britain they were imprisoned after their return to their homeland because the communist regime viewed these warriors as a threat to their occupation of czeckoslavakia the pilots maintain their dignity in prison and during numerous air battles against nazi pilots this film contain a love sub plot that does make sense because it helps us to understand that both civilians and soldiers made great sacrifices to preserve democracy the end of this film indicates that the heroism of these czech pilots was finally recognized in the early 1990 s after the restoration of democracy in the country then known as czeckoslavakia this powerful and moving film was made with financial support from the czech government i highly recommend this film,1
21877,i would like to start by saying i can only hope that the makers of this movie and it s sister film the intruder directed by the great unheralded stylist auteur that is jopi burnama know in their hearts just how much pleasure they have brought to me and my friends in the sleepy north eastern town of jarrow from the opening pre credit sequence which manages to drag ever so slightly despite containing a man crashing through a window on a motorbike the pitiless destruction of a silence lab the introduction of one of the most simultaneously annoying and anaemic bad guys in movie history and costume design that jean paul gautier would find ott and garish make no mistake this is a truly unique experience early highlight an explosion get used to it plenty more where that came from followed by a close up of our chubby heroine and the most hilarious line reading of the word dad in living memory and then the theme song yeah this deserves its own paragraph sung by aj written by people who really should wish to remain anonymous it makes the songs written for the rocky films sound like schubert this is crap 80 s hero motivation narcissism at an all time high with choice lyrics such as its only me and you its come down to the wire and much talk of having to cross the line it ll make sense in time our hero cares little for the boundaries of bona fida police work abounding not to mention the indonesian supremes cooing the film s title seductively at this point anyone wishing to switch off officially has no pulse our hero is semitic cop peter goldson essayed brilliantly by intruder star peter o brien the stabilizer of the title the man s bull in a china shop approach to crime fighting and particularly his less than inconspicuous undercover work truly leaves much to be desired but he is without question an entertaining guide through the mean streets of downtown jakarta with local sleaze ball connection captain johnny in tow as well as peter s own waste of space partner in fashion crime sylvia nash who does little so many highlights so little time the slide please arrogance of peter s not all too convincingly argued case against chief baddie greg rainmaker intruder fans will know hirsute slimy bastard craig gavin as the monstrous john white helluva name eh no oh well the x marks the spot location map stupidity our hero taking horrible advantage of heroine tina probost during a moment of weakness on her behalf the latter turning up at a sting operation dressed like a member of a particularly flamboyant dancing troop and believe me that barely covers it there wasn t even time to go into the plot revolving around the hunt for a drug detection system and a kidnapped professor with an alarming but commendable amount of national pride or our hero turning up at a funeral dressed as if an extra on boogie nights or the absolutely hysterical craic between captain johnny and goldson two guys have never made more heavy weather of buddy buddy shtick than these clowns the trowel was possibly too subtle me thinks ah it tails off people and you never thought scenes of wanton destruction and general mayhem could be so unbelievably boring but the character interaction is stupendous the dialogue truly priceless and the incompetence on show somehow endearing oh and the shoes people watch out for the shoes,1
1150,although not a big coen brothers fan i am an admirer of their dark humor films like fargo and miller s crossing i have been much less impressed by their other comic mode goofy camp or is that camp goofy unfortunately o brother where art thou falls into the latter category and isn t even as good as the big lebowski or the hudsucker proxy o brother is basically an episodic series of in jokes without much point and not all that much humor or cleverness either as most reviewers have noted the film s plot is very loosely and as far as i could tell quite arbitrarily based on the odyssey its main character ulysses everett mcgill george clooney is an adventurer like his homeric namesake and has as his real goal the return home to prevent the marriage of his wife penny to a suitor of course we don t discover that this is what the clooney ulysses character really wants until long after we ve stopped caring and what does homer have to do with cool hand luke chain gangs ku klux klan meetings a la indiana jones cult gatherings a disbarred lawyer s vocabulary a talent for blue grass country music singing an association with baby face nelson a clark gable lookalike hairdo and other random and sundry character traits and encounters i leave that for others to discern the allusion to preston sturges sullivan s travels in o brother s title is equally pointless yes viewers familiar with the sturges minor screwball comedy classic might find it mildly rewarding to recognize the title of the socially conscious depression movie sullivan abandons hollywood and comedy hoping to make and they might even be mildly amused by a couple of shot scene riffs e g hopping freight cars and the chain gang shuffle into view a movie but so what the coen brothers don t seem to have anything to add to the art for art s sake versus moral high seriousness critical debate about the function of art they obviously fall into the former school but that doesn t seem to motivate the reference in the slightest is it an homage if so why make it i like post modern pop culture reference and textual play as much as the next person but it s a lot nicer when it amounts to something at least tonally if not thematically consistent and not just an arbitrary concoction this screenplay is simply a silly mess the only consistent and consistently pleasing element is the folk country music soundtrack it doesn t have much to do with homer or preston sturges but considering the rest of the film that s probably a good thing on the other hand i d recommend using the price of admission on the soundtrack cd,0
13372,this is one you can watch over and over and laugh just as much each time we have been on a keaton fest around here after purchasing some of his films in this one buster is mistaken for an escaped murderer and there are lots of chase scenes and crazy scenes but also what is best about buster his creativity the opening scene is really funny and it just keeps going from there,1
4158,we re in a not so distant future globalization seems to have reached a high point languages mixes with each other although english prevails over the rest races have merged human clonation is a fact and all the territory seems to have been divided in two zones the one for the valid and the one for the non valid a brave new world in aldous huxley s style in which people are genetically filed and blood relationships are strictly forbidden for health reasons that s the code 46 of the title in such environment two souls that are destined not to meet fall in love with each other winterbottom had an important story with quite a big potential a nice recipe that he ruins giving it a so slow rhythm narrating it in a so weary way removing any emotions coldness that s all code 46 transmits coldness and boredom not even the presence of samantha morton and tim robbins both of em play their roles wonderfully nor the visual and sound power of some sequences can do anything to save the movie what a pity code 46 what could have been and never was my rate 4 10,0
2568,man the 90 s really were an horrible decade for movies the movies are lacking in a good style and also the storytelling is often lacking this 6th entry into the long running halloween series is certainly a bad one you just never really get into the story because it isn t a very well constructed and build up movie it s simply a poorly done film that also suffers from its imagine less writing and non compelling characters that are in it dr loomis seems to be in it just for the sake of being in it it s a real shame that this had to be donald pleasence last film role it s nice and also sort of suiting that his last role is in an halloween movie but he definitely deserved to be in a better one there is never a sense of real danger in the movie and the character of michael myers just never comes across as threatening or scary perhaps it s because he s featured too prominently throughout the movie from pretty early on already he does his usual stuff again but without too much class or originality also the attempts to uncover myer s past don t really work out for the main reason that it just doesn t get explained very well it s obvious that the script went through various re writes before and also very possibly during filming several scenes even got re shot or added after the first cut turned out to be far from pleasing the movie more often looks and feels like a made for tv one this is also due to the lack of some real good gore as an horror movie it really is lacking in basically everything to make this a good or even original one to watch so far the worst out of the series 3 10,0
3072,quite possibly one of the greatest wastes of celluloid of the past 100 years not only does it suffer from a painfully and enormously predictable disjointed script but it s clearly a carbon copy of alien ii within five minutes i had correctly predicted who would die and who wouldn t and in which order the special effects are laughable there is a scene where one crew member is mauled unconvincingly by two krites that look like a pair of teddy bears and the sparse humor is misplaced and dire there are better things to do with a vcr remote than use it to watch this movie,0
4492,i watched the unrated version of this movie and as a person who has studied the life and crimes of speck closely i must say this movie is a flawed but ambitious take on the real story while capturing the true horror of speck and the murders this film makes the following factual errors 1 speck did not inject drugs at the crime scene as depicted in the movie in fact he was mainly an alcoholic and pill popper who rarely took drugs via syringe 2 the asian nurse who survived speck s massacre did not squirm her way down stairs and under the couch in the living room as depicted in the movie this would have been impossible in real life she hid under a bed while speck methodically eliminated his 8 victims 3 the movie depicts speck as being violent and brutal with the women as soon as he meets them not true in reality speck was at first calm and gentle reassuring the women he wasn t going to hurt them this is how he was able to tie each of them up 4 the real richard speck was not the deep thinker the movie depicts him to be fbi profiler robert ressler interviewed speck in the 80 s and said that speck not only did nt know why he committed the murders but that he wasn t interested in learning why nor could he shed any light on why speck was known to be of below average intelligence and not the philosopher king who narrates this movie if the story wasn t so tragic and horrifying the voice over would be laughable all in all doug cole s performance is adequately menacing and cold blooded even though i don t think the real speck was so forward in his violence no doubt he was a very violent person when under the influence but he was also known after all for being a fairly slick con man who was able to put people at ease before victimizing them beverly ann sotelo s performance as the surviving nurse is the finest in the film she is a very good actress if you are at all squeamish do not see this film it s very graphic and disturbing,0
9146,a true yawner and a bad film even for the chan series i like a good charlie chan film or even a reasonably good one but this one falls way short of the mark charlie is enlisted to help figure out the murder of a scientist working for our government when someone in the house has stolen the plans for another power the mystery is very pedestrian and the acting doesn t fare much better the only saving grace for me in the film was the presence of mantan moreland as birmingham brown he gives the film a little comedy and has some good scared faces but after that the pickings are rather slim benson fong is here as tommy chan and pairs up with chan s daughter of all things what about sidney toler he is pretty decent but looks like he is straining to carry the film what i noticed most was the way the film was shot chan director phil rosen of whom i generally like most of his entries uses lots of long shots with no action like charlie s initial walk into the house from outside why the film is only 64 minutes long for crying out loud shots like that tell me the director had to fill time up because the script was even weaker than he was accustomed to this probably isn t the worst chan film ever made but up to now it is the worst i have sat through unfortunately,0
22994,as most other reviewers seem to agree this adaptation of after the funeral is very good indeed always one of my favourite poirot stories i was worried that it might be messed about with well it was a little bit but only a little bit and the end the result was thoroughly entertaining david suchet continues to be well nigh faultless as poirot and as others have pointed out the other star of this show is monica dolan who surely could not be bettered as miss gilchrist i also really enjoyed fiona glasscott who was spot on as the cutting rosamund shane but really the casting was quite impeccable throughout one point is knocked off for the adaptors not being able to resist cramming too many revelations into the final fifteen minutes the business with the will and house deeds was all a bit unnecessary although i didn t mind how they tightened up the structure of the abernethie family in the book the family tree is really quite complicated the final moments when the murderer is revealed however are really incredibly well done and i found the very end when they all leave enderby quite touching this is really one of the very best of the poirot series so far,1
9446,i usually don t write reviews for shows unless i ve seen them in full however there were so many positive views of this show on here i felt it was necessary to balance it out with a bit of realism this show is hysterically bad i don t think it was meant to be but it is i see that there s lots of praise being showered upon the show and i honestly can t understand why this show is so poorly acted the dialogue is so awful and the plots are thin around their holes i think that this show is interesting in that it is a definite litmus test of your standards some elements of the show work and perhaps those elements are just more important to some people than those that don t work which make the show nearly unwatchable to people like me if you enjoy making fun of a show as you watch it anticipating clich d lines and such this can be an enjoyable show to ridicule if you have that sort of time on your hands the pilot is a pretty fair example of the whole show if the nonsense saccharin clich ending doesn t leave you in a dumb shock then this may be a show for you,0
9091,very poor quality and the acting is equally as bad this movie is a prime example of present day england and the mindset there is no mention of jesus in this movie nor does the movie feature any type of scripture christianity as most know it i am also very surprised because this film is a bbc program and the bbc is quit well known for their quality programing but it looks like the bbc s attempt to rival the hollywood psycho drama films are failing completely poor acting poor plot poor culture that seems to be without religion i would not even bother buying this instead better to try to rent this one or buy it when it goes to the 2 dollar bin,0
3030,sometimes you just have to have patients when watching indie horror if you can just toe tap your way through the slow paced early scenes sometimes a real gem will present itself this unfortunately was not the case with satan s whip written and directed by jason maran satan s whip attempts to drag us along on a boring snore fest of a film with no real pay off at the end i m guessing that the black white and blue cinematography must have been for a reason however it is never explained why the majority of the blood is blue and i found this increasingly annoying as the film went on the story in itself is not that bad and actually had some originality and decent content but the acting is simply pathetic this combined with the slow pacing and lack of any real red gore made satan s whip one to forget quite quickly i will give it a 4 rating for some witty dialog that made me chuckle but alas that could not save this boring waste of my time,0
6910,this was a fabulous premise based on lots of factual history but the serious lack of character development left us not really liking or caring about any of the characters especially the musicologist she did not get any sympathy she seems like she deserved his own black cloud the songs were great to a point but became repetitive after a while,0
4887,how could this get a 6 0 rating are we as horror fans so used to horror films being so utterly bad these days that when one comes along that has some and i repeat only some redeeming quality s we get much too excited and give a rating that is just a wee bit too high the director has a certain visual flair no doubt about that but in between some decent shots he forgot a good story mood or scares it had a very slow first act lazy killing scene s annoying and flat characters and a very stupid and very unbelievable twist and what s with the portrayal of american teenagers in so many of these kinds of films do they always have to be this stupid irritating and so godd mn superficial i don t remember teens being like this when i grew up here in holland all things considered in can t give this film anything more that a 4 out of 10 rating,0
16452,this is one of my favourite disney films it has everything you could hope for in a disney animation cute animals great songs a nasty villain and lots of adventure the story begins in paris where aristocat duchess and her three kittens live with their mistress in a mansion life is perfect for them until the mistress fiendish butler edgar discovers that she plans to leave her entire fortune to the cats he realises that if he even stands a chance of claiming the fortune the cats will be out of the way an excellent often forgotten masterpiece from the 1970 s a time when the disney studio made few animations which features songs such as the title number the aristocats as well as ev rybody wants to be a cat this will enchant viewers young and old with its enduring jazziness,1
4910,i m watching this film as i write this it s about 45 minutes into the film and there s been so much back and forth and empty drama i don t quite see where it s going no facts just enough to leave you making assumptions the acting of main daughter is painful how did this ever get made not the best of lifetime films,0
5560,this has got to be the worse move i ve ever seen it was not only boring it was gag me with a spoon dumb where d ya find the actors on a street corner who did the special effects maaco for god s sakes i could have made a better movie with my cell phone and if that wasn t bad enough you even had extras at the end of the movie so we could see just how stupid the actors are in real life who ever did the makeup for the aliens must have spent 5 at your local used costume store and called it a day and who in the world wrote up the movie description on the back of the dvd case should be shot puhleez it s not even 1 8 of what it is described as that description is just to suck people in to buying renting or paying a ticket to see it no wonder there was never a trailer to it ya would have drove them all away bad actors 5 special effects 5 50 fake fire 1 89 cigarette lighter time spent watching this movie total waste i should sue ya for my time watching it,0
10257,the original australian kath kim is brilliant why do american producers need to remake ruin yet another classic show remember the original version of the office with ricky gervais it was an absolute masterpiece and there was no need to remake it the producers said that the british humour from the office and the australian humour from kath kim would not translate to an american audience what so basically they are saying that americans are too dumb and stupid to understand the jokes so they need to remake the shows with over the top childish gags so that the americans can understand the humour the original australian version of kath kim is fantastic and very funny avoid the american version like the plague,0
15791,vhs i have watched this over and over and loved every minute of it so much so i have now ordered the dvd i only wished the film could have lasted longer i never worry about what other people think i prefer to make my own mind up and entirely disagree with the negative comments and will not let others spoil my enjoyment of the film whatsoever make up your own mind and don t let others put you off i have all jane austen s bbc series but this is my favourite i see there is to be a new northanger abbey released in 2007 which i will buy when it comes out but it will not stop me watching northanger abbey released in the 80 s,1
1970,my guess is that the producers of this low budget space horror film wanted a serious movie but the director had his heart set on a parody so this is what we get set in an abandoned spaceship 1000 years in the future and peopled with characters and props right out of the 90 s the set is some industrial complex maybe an oil tanker whatever they use is as is so the controls consist racks of old tv equipment one location is obviously the employees lunchroom and sports an old tv and vcr as well as a water cooler with plastic demijohn tiny lister and coolio get the best lines arguing throughout the story the dialog is packed with terms that are pretty dated even now a ok daddy o but then maybe the 30th century is very retro when the captain declares the ships cargo is a load of coffins from the transylvania station you know this is all a put on its a bit of alien part jasonx shameless rip off of all the best sci fi and horror titles at one point casper vandien even tells his pilot to make it so with a straight face this film would have been better if they had just let everyone run with the satire but they keep attempting to make the story serious maybe the backers were on the set that day anyway not a bad boredom killer if you aren t too picky fx are as good as the sets are bad,0
9331,thats what this movie really takes a big piece of cheeze this movie is about a sister and brother bonnie and clyde type of duo that creates their own party line in order to lure their victims in and trap them and kill them but for what reason just for the fun of getting away with it in comes richard hatch who comes across as a wishy washy ladies man a real bad version of a ladies man and he gets involved with finding who s behind all the killings across la he finally meets a teenager who helps him find the killer and rest is for your fun and amusement but there are parts in this film that really get me going like the scene with lief garret dressed in his mothers wedding gown acting like a sissy in front of his sister telling her that he needs her and can t live without her and watching as she slaps him across the face dominateing him i can t believe that was lief well i guess i could but it s worth watching but only to see one of garrets worst films that he ever did,0
24020,dead man walking absolutely brilliant in tears by the end you can not watch this film and not think about the issues it raises how can you justify killing whether it be murder or the death penalty and to what point is forgiveness possible not just in a spiritual way don t watch this film when your down but watch it,1
23014,the movie haggard is one of the funniest movies of all time it features the cast from cky the movies and also has a great soundtrack if you have seen any cky or viva la bam you will notice that everybody from those two are in it including bam s parents and many other people the story is about ryan dunn s girlfriend glauren jennifer rivall cheating on him and him trying to get back at her he does this by having valo bam and falcone dicamillo vandalize her house there are many different characters with many different stories there is great music on the soundtrack bands such as him her cky gnar kill daniel lioneye iggy and the stooges pop and new order if you do not like viva la bam or cky the movies i doubt you will like this if you do like that stuff this movie is great,1
11464,aaran is one of the movies where you find the loop holes in indian cinema here is one good example to show how excellent writers directors and actors succumb to the producers here is one of the most wonderful actors mohanlal acting in a movie about a real story in kashmir the seriousness of the film is slaughtered with sub standard comic scenes and songs there is this character havaldar jaykumar who in reality is the son of the producer of the film hence he doesn t have a hair cut despite his officer asking him to do so this kid doesn t know what is acting and he is the hero of the movie god help indian cinema with such producers this movie is a pathetic display of what happens in kashmir a sensible viewer can intuitively understand the constraints of such wonderful writers actors and directors who want to share their real life experiences but the unfortunate part is that a movie about the highest ranks in indian militia turns out to be a pathetic display that only makes one think that the movie was stupid we should oust such producers in the film industry and pave way for good cinema,0
24196,this was one of those films i would always come across be it on tv or cheap dvd but never struck me to give it a shot as i thought i wasn t missing out on much it was on one night and i thought oh well why not a good decision too as i would kick myself for taking so long to get around to it for me it left me impressed as it s up there with burt reynold s best features deliverance white lightning and boogie nights and streams back to those 70s 80s gritty hardboiled urban crime thrillers that weren t afraid to be forebodingly obscure and go out of their way to set up characters pack it with realistically brutal force and effectively incorporate the local locations atlanta being the case here to the fold with grounded photography in certain shades it kind of reminded me of dirty harry but that s loosely however it s saucily honed blues score with its simmering kicks funky shifts and unhinged sounds very much had me thinking of lalo schifrin s pulsating score he orchestrated for dirty harry the music soundtrack on the other hand is hit or miss sgt tom sharky was an atlantic narcotic agent before a slip out during a bust saw him demoted to vice work along with his new squad they come across a prostitution ring which catches their interest due to fact it s owned by one hard to track and to convict crime lord what they dig up involves a prominent government figure and a call girl which can give them some important names but they must get to her before she s made a target burt reynold s acts but also directs in an unyieldingly firm and muscular fashion which would suit his laconically hard nosed performance and gerald di pego s thematically hard bitten and taut screenplay that was adapted from william diehl s novel well he does show some sort of heart insightful thoughts amongst that armor within the scenes involving the fetchingly able british actress rachel ward be it the stake out scenes when he s watching her from another building and slowly becoming infatuated by her to when they finally come together but these latter interactions mid way through do slow up the momentum but give it noir like strokes the performances are fairly spot on with reynold s formulating a great rapport with exceptional actors charles durning earl holliman brian keith richard libertini and bernie casey the scathing profanity and witty dialogues between these guys were a blast as for the corrupt villains vittorio gassman builds imposing strength and power but it s henry silva who seems born for these roles icily cunning and unstoppable turn that makes the show where his appearance seems to outline things to come and help them fall into place plus his adrenaline filled and violent cat and mouse climax with sharky and his team is brilliantly done the exciting action passages might be quick and dry but remain lethally violent like an immensely teeth grinding interrogation sequence some handy old fashion filming techniques add to the suspense the intriguing material keeps it quite tactical being character derived but when we think its smooth sailing it offers up a blunt surprise or two along with some intensely brunt confrontations,1
21164,i wasn t surprised to read a comment by the director to the effect that she made this film as an antidote to all those making of dvd featurettes as that certainly struck me i do confess that i have a penchant for meta but i found this film to be very accessible and entertaining and not even in a labored self consciously clever way which is certainly a bit of what you expect in a film about film making it is very french in that there are a great deal of outlandish yet occasionally compelling theories about how film making and even sexuality works but since the director doesn t quite play herself using an avatar instead we re left with a lot of choices since i m pretty sure she s constantly contradicting herself apparently catherine breillat specializes in hard to watch films but i d definitely say this one doesn t qualify i really enjoyed the dialog the balance between the cinematic and the natural the relationships between the director character and her assistant and actor and so on highly recommended,1
23778,this movie has it all great actors good dialog drama comedy and excellent writing and directing by paul thomas anderson i have seen this film several times and enjoy it more each time it doesn t get old it is consistently entertaining and stimulating easily burt reynolds best role and he does a great job john c reilly and don cheadle also give excellent comedic performances there is not a weak element in this film,1
10026,jurassic park iii adventure sam nell the dish william macy happy texas fargo tz a leoni family man a better title would be escape from the island of really mean dinosaurs but then no one would need to see the film in this sequel a rag tag group pays a visit to the island of dinosaurs to rescue the teenage victim of a hang gliding accident access hollywood reports jp3 began filming without a completed script that explains why the film seems to have little or no purpose other than to demonstrate state of the art special effects sure there are a few clever scenes and some moderately funny bits but no meaningful plot line to tie them together the dinosaur puppets and animation in jp3 are very good to excellent and more numerous than ever but the overall film experience can not hold a candle to the original jurassic park or even jp2 jp3 is a mercifully short 90 minutes the last 10 minutes of which is credits even at that i found myself frequently checking my wristwatch the audience i saw it with left the theater in silence a better bet see the movie legally blonde dave,0
17036,peter segal s 1995 commercial hit now cult classic tommy boy is a hilarious film an evergreen entertainer chris farley is a talent which we ll never ever forget tommy boy is a simple story told in the funniest zany way possible farley spade take a journey which is filled with unstoppable laughter even the rob lowe portion is damn funny as a kid i remember watching tommy boy again and again and again it s been of my childhood favorites and it will always remain to be even today when it comes on t v i stick to it as a die hard fan i am quite possessive about this film segal s direction is super chris farley might have died in 1997 but remains alive for me at least what an actor watch his work in tommy boy he s so much at ease he delivered fantastic performances later on in films like berverly hills ninja almost heroes but his work in here remains as his best to date love you farley spade on the other hand is as good as ever he s an excellent actor in all respects tommy boy rules 100 thumbs up from this writer,1
666,poor jane austen this dog of a production does not do her wonderful tongue in cheek novel any justice starting at the top poorly adapted the screenwriter deserves extra low marks for trying to come to think of it i don t know what she was trying for but suffice it to say she missed the mark by light years couple that with all the over acting and awful production values this is one adaptation that should never have happened it would have been far better if they just gave all the money they poured into this flop and donated it to a worthy charity do yourself a favor read the book it is almost certain that you will enjoy it a thousand times more than trying to sit through this excruciating production,0
2681,i discovered the patriot in a dvd store and thought it could be a real action thriller no it s instead a low budget movie with a ridiculous story it s no doubt a cable movie and not one for the theatre fortunately after 90 minutes the movie stops otherwise the audience should have taken an anti virus against sleep one thing came over it was the nice country the film has been shot you can really feel the american air but that s all i hope for steven seagal that he finally succeeds in a big hit it is not a must see because i and my wife voted average 4 10,0

doing in the new boy free they were told facilities the only solution miss whitchurch and pond their teachers and their students concoct a split second shifting of classes to give the allusion that nutbourne has no girls and that st swithen s has no boys after the parents inspect a dorm and leave for a class the girls in the beds duck under and the boys who d been hidden under leap up into the beds just as the governors walk in the boys are observed at rugby and as soon as the governors turn their backs the goal posts are taken down nets for lacrosse are put up and just then the parents walk over to observes the girls one parent spots her daughter in a science class then moments later sees her in a choir practice then moments later there s angela again she says to miss whitchurch why so it is she replies hustling the parents out to avoid the governors who are approaching just around the corner the child s quite ubiquitous when we leave nutbourne everything has been discovered the students are milling about the teachers are dazed except for two who are kissing the education ministry has just sent several more busloads of students the parents are speechless but the governors are not we re waiting for an explanation one says sharply pond holds his head and shudders can t you see i m trying to think of one the film moves from one complicated and ridiculous situation after another braced by a very funny script and two hugely comedic performances by rutherford and sim sim s droll exasperation and rutherford s implacable determination are so well matched that s it s a shame this is the only movie they ever made together joyce grenfell as gossage st swithen s tall awkward loping sports teacher gives them some competition if you keep your eyes open you ll also find some amusing references director frank launder works in including a gong at nutbourne that looks just like a midget version of j arthur rank s a faint echo of the zither theme from the third man and a shot stolen from david lean s oliver twist except this time the little boy walks up holding his porridge bowl and says please sir i don t want anymore frank launder and his partner sidney gilliat were responsible for some of the best films produced in britain during the thirties forties and fifties they wrote produced and directed sometimes doing one sometimes the other in one way or another they were responsible for such first rate films as green for danger with a masterly droll performance by sim i see a dark stranger the lady vanishes night train to munich wee geordie the belles of st trinian s the rake s progress and many others with the happiest days of your life launder wrote and directed while both produced it s one of their best,1
6905,this series is formulaic and boring the episodes are the same thing every week simply with slightly varied settings some purely evil character does some dastardly deed walker goes after him and it ends in a karate match the villains are super clich super stereotypical evil villains the good guys are all pure honest and saintly and the story lines are simplistic and unrealistic after about 2 episodes the show becomes totally unwatchable by all but the least discerning fans certainly not norris s best work his other work may be clich but it usually does not drag on for weeks if you enjoy formulaic boring repetitive clich d snooze fests then this is for you,0
19461,this was a great movie and the sequel should know our socks off the action will be nonstop and i just bought the special edition dvd with the animated background story similar to the animatrix this will put vin diesel back in the spotlight and hopefully get him the coveted role in spider man 3 as venom he would be the most logical choice for the role back to pb this movie even though it is a indie thriller it has a great story and characters with backgrounds that scream for you to want to learn more if they were to do books or comics it would be a great read there was one thing that i felt was a little under done the ending it needed a little work but not every movie will have the best ending,1
6776,while traveling by train a woman st phane excoffier mistakenly gets out in a remote station when the train stops in the middle of the night sooner she finds that a weird lonely pointsman jim van der woude that does not speak her language is the only person in that area and that that was the last train in that track the man lodges her in his house and they develop an unusual wordless relationship between them de wisselwachter is an overrated boredom with a different but uninteresting story that goes nowhere i like movies off hollywood but this story is too absurd and has no message in the end the sexual tension between the two lead characters is funny in a moment but too repetitive i saw this movie in an old vhs and the image is too dark i do not know whether on dvd the image would be of better quality in the end i was absolutely disappointed with this feature my vote is three title brazil o homem da linha the man of the line,0
19224,lifeforce starts in outer space where the hms churchill tracks haley s comet it s equipment detects a 150 mile long alien spaceship in the head of the comet unable to contact earth because of interference colonel tom carlsen steve railsback decides this is the one only chance to investigate it going outside in spacesuits carlsen some of his crew enter the mysterious spaceship find the remains of a bat like race of creatures three perfect looking humanoids two men chris jagger bill malin a beautiful woman mathilda may all of whom they take aboard the churchill thirty days later back on earth the churchill is detected on radar a rescue mission is sent up only to discover the spaceship is burnt out all the crew supposedly dead the rescue team do find the three humanoid aliens though take them back to earth where in a space research center in london they come back to life start to literally suck the lifeforce out of human victims who then in turn need to do the same to stop themselves turning into dust things look grim as the epidemic spreads throughout london this english production was produced by the notorious menahem golan yoram globus who during the early 80 s were responsible for lots of cheap low budget action flicks under their production company cannon usually starring chuck norris they wanted to move into the big time signed director tobe hooper up on a three film deal which were this lifeforce the invaders from mars 1986 remake the texas chainsaw massacre 2 1986 a sequel to hooper s own classic all of which flopped basically bankrupt both golan globus cannon was no more anyway despite being a commercial flop at the box office i have to say i think lifeforce is a highly enjoyable if rather silly sci fi horror when originally released into theatres back in 85 lifefore was cut down to 101 minutes by golan globus but over the past few years the longer 116 minute cut has all but replaced it on dvd vhs laserdisc tv although apparently hooper s original cut of the film ran for 128 minutes so there s even more footage out there somewhere i will be basing my comments on the longer 116 minute cut the script by dan o bannon don jakoby uncredited rewrites by michael armstrong olaf pooley was based on the 1976 novel the space vampires by colin wilson has many extraordinary ideas it s scope is truly ambitious one felt that it ends up being a bit of a mess but a hell of an entertaining one it moves along like a rocket at heart there s a really interesting story here although the film gets itself into a tangle there are also some hilarious moments in lifeforce the scene when the security guard tries to convince the naked female vampire to surrender by offering her a half eaten biscuit is a true camp classic the horribly overwrought hypnosis scenes including the one where railsback ends up kissing patrick stewart many many more besides i don t know call me weird but i just thought lifeforce was tremendous fun highly entertaining in just about every way from silly character s odd dialogue strange ideas that never quite come together some terrific visuals lifeforce certainly isn t a film that will bore you director hooper had just about more money here to play around with than he ever has double what he had for poltergeist 1982 even he uses every bit of it to bring this spectacular film to the big screen john dykstra the guy responsible for star wars 1977 star trek the motion picture 1979 more recently spider man 2002 was brought in to handle the visual effects generally speaking they look fabulous the sequences set in outer space with spaceships in particular look great there s also some really good visual effects back on earth including the destruction of london as 100 s of blue souls fly around everywhere there s some nudity but not much gore there are some withered corpses a few gunshot wounds the skin on someones hand peels off blood spurts from someones eyes nose ears there s a severed arm as well as some zombies the special make up effects are also generally very good i wouldn t say lifeforce is scary as such as it s more of a sci fi film than horror i loved the way hooper shoots the outer space sequences as he keeps rotating his camera to effectively capture the feeling of weightlessness that there is no solid floor as it were with a supposed budget of about 25 000 000 it made less than half that in it s theatrical run hasn t set the world alight on video or dvd either which is a shame because although it s a bit of a mess it s very enjoyable to watch shot on location in england well filmed in 2 35 1 widescreen the 4 3 cropped image is horrible cuts huge chunks of information from both sides of the screen this is most noticeable during the opening scenes set in outer space where sometimes it s hard to make out what s going on the sense of the vastness of space the alien spaceship is lost the acting is ok in a very silly film patrick stewart replaced sir john gielgud nancy paul replaced olivia hussey frank finlay replaced klaus kinski while anthony hopkins turned the role of caine down lifeforce is a bizarre film no two ways about it really anyone looking for something simple straight forward should look elsewhere anyone looking for something a bit different in the sci fi genre than give lifeforce a go as it s one of those so bad it s good films with some impressive effects it isn t your average run of the mill film by any means,1
20462,i found this movie to be quite enjoyable and fairly entertaining good characters good actors and enough suspense to keep your interest throughout the plot twists might have been a bit much but overall a decent thriller if you liked this film i would recommend the spanish prisoner the house of games and no way out,1
984,i saw this movie considering this as a normal hollywood movie but then came to know that its a movie made for tv channel on my dvd cover out of 2 critics comments one of the critic stephen farber from moviline reveiwed it as a best movie of the year all the character were simple and decent performances except the brain s character which never gets scope which director wanted to keeps mystery till end there was suspense till end but when you see the end that lady police officer and main culprit had a lesbian affair seems to be totally stupid idea god knows what happens to dave the male lead character the other critic from mr brown s movies said that shocking and effective but doesn t quite live up to all the hype which i saw after watching the movie for which i was partially aggree i should have read this first before taking the movie,0
6809,this movie could have been summed up in about 10 minutes i don t know what everyone else was smoking calling this a beatiful film i feel that a couple hours of my life were stolen from me and i want them back i would put this in the category of a battlefield earth yes folks it is that bad you would do just as well to watch a two minute clip of this movie over and over it would have the same effect do not waste your time,0
21801,the movie was excellent save for some of the scenes with esposito i enjoyed how it brought together every detective on the series and wrapped up some plotlines that were never resolved during the series thanks to nbc it was great to see pembleton and bayliss together at their most human and most basic persons braugher and secor did a great job but as usual will get overlooked it hurt to see that this was the end of homicide memories tapes and reruns on courttv just aren t the same as watching it come on every friday but the movie did its job and did it very well presenting a great depiction of life after al retired and the family relationship that existed between the unit i enjoyed this a lot,1
12997,the last frontier is a superior western that overcomes numerous deficiencies in weaving its tale of trappers jed victor mature gus james whitmore and mongo pat hogan and their relationships with the army particularly captain riordon guy madison colonel marston robert preston and corrina marston colonel s wife anne bancroft hired as scouts after losing their supplies to the indians jed gus and mungo adjust to living the civilized life within a fort on the edge of the last frontier jed who has been raised by gus both inspires and looks up to the older gus and mungo and has an especially difficult time dealing with civilization his real problems start after he becomes strongly attracted to the colonel s wife corrina colonel marstonis a reckless man who endangers every one around him with his dreams of ruthless victory over any opponent corrina a woman repressed by her station and sense of responsibility loves her husband for what he could be and jed for what he is caught in the middle is captain riordon a brave and likeable man torn among his duty to the army his strong friendship with jed and his fear of the likely disastrous consequences of the colonel s recklessness what makes this movie so interesting as well as entertaining is that in most cases the weaknesses and the strengths of the last frontier are exactly the same elements forget the insipid title and dated music first the screenplay almost all of the subplots particularly the reckless colonel have been done better elsewhere but have rarely been assembled with such eccentricity just when you think you know what is going to happen next this one takes off in a different direction possible spoiler the last frontier being a production code movie back in the day the word virgin was taboo it s very surprising that the adultery factor was handled in such a mature tolerant manner i expected either jed or the colonel s wife to reap some retribution for their sin i was surprised and a little disappointed the movie didn t exploit that expectation to create a less predictable ending second the casting mature is at least ten years too old to play the part of jed the wild eyed innocent raised in the woods james whitmore who plays gus the man who raised jed is actually five years younger than mature nevertheless mature is very endearing playing a character who is innocent of civilization but is in no way stupid although there were several actors who could have played the role at the time most notably burt lancaster and kirk douglas none could have played jed better preston also mature s junior plays colonel marston missing the tics and affectations one would expect from such a driven man however preston perfectly captures the sense of honor someone must have seen in marston to promote such a reckless fool to colonel s rank bancroft is an especially shrewd choice as corrina bancroft s dark hair has been died blonde and this achieves the same effect as it did for winona ryder edward scissorhands and christina ricci sleepy hollow that is i felt conflicted about the character without knowing exactly why i believe the answer is that blondes and brunettes have considerably different skin tones and eye shades further bancroft has always projected a toughness that borders on hardness here the blonde hair softens her up a bit though this enables the 24 year old bancroft to stand toe to toe with both the 40 year old mature and the 37 year old preston yep she could be a colonel s wife madison walks a careful balancing act as riordan handling a complex role and sometimes ackward dialogue playing a role similar to that of john wayne in fort apache madison does a more skillful job at it this movie has a silverado type camaraderie that alone makes it worth seeing it also has memorable performances beautiful scenerary and great action and direction i just hope a letterbox version is available many have been lost because this movie takes full advantage of that format,1
9207,gordon goes over the top in typical full moon fashion but that s to be expected combs is surprisingly low key keeping his performance at a more realistic level than we are used to seeing also gone is the usual stuart gordon tongue in cheek black humor the film is quite effective in showing combs break down and his final heroic act to save his wife daughter you actually feel sympathy for his character despite his short comings personally i was more surprised at the nudity and borderline porno sex scene than i was shocked by the graphic violence gore not classic gordon but certainly something you might enjoy if you ve seen his more famous films,0
8120,i walked into heart of gold thinking i was going to watch a documentary about neil young instead i witnessed a self serving tribute to the arrogance of aging baby boomers who have lost their edge and forgotten their roots highly rated by aging baby boomer critics directed and performed by more aging baby boomer artists heart of gold is a bore fest from start to finish that is if you can manage to sit through the entire near 2 hour movie neil young and crew have long lost their edge and want the rest of us to join them on a cushioned rocking chair of middle of the road mediocrity what happened to the raunchy guitar of his earlier solo efforts i guess all of his fuzz boxes rusted out and his over driven vacuum tubes exploded in the hot air of his generation as far as demme goes this is the daring director of something wild melvin and howard a student filmmaker could have made a more daring film than this poorly visualized surface performance film don t waste your on heart of gold and go straight to the last waltz and gimmie shelter and if you really want to dig deep into the personality of a rock and roll icon scrounge up a copy of chuck berry hail hail rock and roll which is sorely out of print and baby boomers don t bother squawking about how this review is jaded by someone younger i too am one of those baby boomers who listened to cinnamon girl on acid and danced in the streets to the stones street fighting man go back and watch don t look back or gimmie shelter and then come back and tell me that heart of gold has any worth as a document,0
3440,spoilers oh sure it s based on moby dick totally obsessed and it destroy s him it s a total folly the movie starts off rather well but by the end of the film everyone else is destroyed and the main star s mind is a blank the supposed half sister is never convincing some very poor lighting effects music is interesting but little else it took me over a month to finally finish the darn thing i suppose if you like being john malkovich you might like this but where as bjm was a great movie that i just didn t want to watch again pola x is a movie i just hate to high hell the only possible excitement in the film is the gratuatious incest sexual scene towards the end of the film hopefully yer not thinking of catherine either this movie is severely boring depressing and poorly directed not highly recommended if if you like french movies go watch crimson rivers instead 4 10quality 5 10 entertainment 1 10 replayable 0 10,0
23089,brilliant work marvelous actors dissolve as brave and courageous characters all unforgettable parts in a more than intriguing and capturing action thriller the casting is perfect both from the side of the stars like armand asante bernhardt kier denier but as well for new faces i was very impressed by the young actor who plays the boy gang member mustafa you trust each one from the turkish gang very convincing is michael barral and all white power followers i admire the music beat of the main theme of children of wax this sound track is a charming mixture of turkish hard rock and udo kier s humming and in the same time children of wax a tale focusing on racial conflicts the intolerance and brutality between the skinheads and the turks,1
1604,if i could rate it a zero i would coming from someone who likes shock exploitation films of the time and waters overall i must say this is useless it does nothing serves nothing an idiot with a camera and a urge to prove his cleverness by rebeling against social standards is all this comes off as its entirely amateur both in principle and execution it doesn t have a point its digusting for the sake of disgusting obscene with the wit of a neanderthal its useless someone said waters was probably chuckling over all the bad press and disgust others gave with this film but why if i made a short film depicting a man in a bathroom taking a sh t for ten minutes straight surely it would receive the same accomidations but why would i be proud or chuckle at that would it be because i am so unintelligent that i have to resort to this so i can say ha take that censors and mainstream im so rebellious ill do whatever i want and film it no waters shouldn t be proud of this mess fans of waters shouldn t watch it its useless that is without any use its doesn t even fit under the criteria of art for arts sake to like or defend this movie is to defend something that was designed purposely as being anti culture to be pushed for the mainstream audience in modern terms this film is the hot topic of films useless and obsolete a poser film that demands it be acknowledged as rebellion,0
11041,my blurred childhood memories have kept the echo of the cult serie of belph gor in the french 60 s so i was eager to see the big screen adaptation i should have kept my money and gone for a stroll in the louvre the idea of the scenario is still very apt and interesting the fantom of le louvre but the adaptation is ridiculous the dialogues hesitate permanently between french irony and serious american business without achieving neither but not without sounding asinine acting leaves somehow to be desired and special effects are meager compared to what one could expect low budget what is left of all that not much outside a few good shots of paris which is seldom a disappointment belph gor was worth more than that,0
8958,i m sorry but i just honestly cannot see why anyone would actually like this it s stereotypical and real homeschoolers are nothing like they were on this show personally i m glad it got canceled after the first few episodes i mean this kind of show would certainly be alright if everyone knew that homeschoolers weren t really like this and the whole story was just for the show but unfortunately not everyone is aware of this if anyone out there that watched this actually believed this is what goes on in the life of a homeschooler then i honestly feel sorry for them this reminds me of the kind of portrayal they have of homeschooled kids in mean girls it s sad really that people think this way this is complete garbage imho,0
9007,the only reason i checked this film out was to see the early kim bassinger that and the fact that my tv guide said it was a gripping suspense and it was three star rated the rating must have come from the man who wrote this drivel because the only suspense in this movie was whether i would finish it or not robert culp turns in what has to be the disaster of his career as a cop who is not even close to being believeable at one point everybody is a suspect including a frail old woman if you want to deliberately set out to watch a badly written badly directed badly acted movie then go for it it may make you appreciate fine films by comparison i wish i had that hour and thirty six minutes back,0
21929,as roger corman has said in an interview low budget film making enables film makers to take chances on offbeat ideas well you d be hard pressed to find a film that thrives on the offbeat as mightily as george barry s death bed the bed that eats the film does have a back story to it and it s an interesting one at that i ll forgo relaying any sort of details so you can hear them for yourself if you take a chance on watching it suffice it to say the title item of furniture has an insatiable hunger consuming the unwary with a bubbling yellow foam that dissolves its victims like acid death bed is an eerie haunting little flick that plays out its absurd premise in such a way that it transcends the usual assortment of schlock fare it occupies its particular dream world in such a way that it was possible for me to take it seriously it s a truly strange and unconventional horror flick it dabbles in exploitative ingredients there s some tasty dollops of female nudity and yet is also art albeit art with a completely skewed sensibility the special effects are not too bad for a film with a microscopic budget and barry gives the film a good and atmospheric midnight movie quality the acting from the cast is as uninspired as one could imagine although patrick spence thomas lends a reasonable amount of gravitas as the artist narrator and one definite point of interest is seeing one familiar face on hand future boy meets world father william russ this film might not have even found the small cult following that it does have were it not for pirated copies making the rounds this certainly has to rank as one of the instances where such a practice ultimately ended up helping the film even if the exposure took years to take hold if you have a taste for truly bizarre obscure items death bed may be just what you ve got in mind 7 10,1
2479,this is a pretty pointless remake starting with the opening title shots of the original was a real mistake as it reminds the viewer of what a great little period piece chiller that was the new version that follows is an exercise in redundancy brian kerwin plays a city boy photographer who returns to a semi abandoned desert town populated by a scattering of underdeveloped clich d stock characters the lollipop sucking daby doll lolita the ornery old coot prospector the crippled vet and his asian wife etc kerwin s character witnesses the crashing of something into a hillside and shortly after strange things start to happen as pieces of weird blue rock are scattered around the temperature starts to rise all the water in the area vanishes people start to act weirdly things explode kerwin s character gets in and out of his car more often than is humanly possible in one movie the film develops no sense of place no character development no humour no tension everything that made the jack arnold s original a creepy little cold war paranoia classic has been abandoned it just runs through its minimal hoops and then just ends the special effects aren t very special the interior of the ship looks like bits of cling film wrapped round some ropes which were then dangled in front of the camera to frame some of the most uninspired and clumsy wire work ever put onto the screen the script is repetitive everyone says everything at least twice kerwin gets to say let s get out of here at least three times during the movie twice in one scene loads of things are left unexplained at the end why do the aliens need all the heat and water for example not that anyone watching would care if the film makers didn t care why should we the acting is adequate better than the script which at times has an under rehearsed improvisational quality deserves though often the actors look like they just want to get the thing over with as quickly as possible a notable example of this is when elizabeth pe a registers the briefest token moment of frustrated despair hands to face gesture before following sulking son stevie outside to watch him do angry sulky teenager smashing something off a table gesture continuity errors include the gb sticker on the back of kerwin s jeep appearing and disappearing a double action of the gas in the exploding car a towns person being in two places simultaneously once in the alien stevie s pov shot then immediately afterwards in a reaction shot elizabeth pe a appearing to shut a car door twice you can tell i was gripped can t you the movie commits that greatest of errors it s boring,0
24761,i remember disliking this movie the 1st time i saw it but it has grown on me i love the costumes and poses the actors make the humor the cinematography the soundtrack the scenes are very rich and it moves very quickly every time i watch it there is something new that catches my eye aaliyah as akasha is probably the only thing that ruins it but not enough also the lestat in this movie is different it is not the same character you can see that the character armand has been given lestat like qualities because i m assuming anne wanted it in but there is no reason to trash this movie just because it s not like books it s a fascinating by itself,1
4804,so we re supposed to find it funny that this woman travels all the way to the jungle to the warzone just to find out why her fianc e didn t travel to switzerland or are we supposed to take it seriously it s not even remotely funny clever or entertaining it s stupid and so is the movie the lead actress is one of the most annoying characters i have ever seen in a movie even worse than jar jar binks dialog tries very hard to be funny almost all the time but it never is the number of funny jokes is somewhere between zero and nothing and as for the plot did they even once bothered to explain to us what are the rebels fighting for other than being anti government i guess that didn t matter to anyone neither to the rebels nor to the characters who just blindly flew to the battlefield don t waste your time coronado is neither funny nor entertaining,0
24841,this landmark film can now be seen in two different versions on the grapevine video release which also includes the english translation of selma lagerlof s novel which she based on a swedish folktale the first version is the swedish edit under the title of the phantom carriage the second version is a reconstruction of the way it was shown in the united states under the title of the stroke of midnight as released by metro before it was m g m the actual us release has long vanished but a detailed review in the new york times lets us know how the scenes were reordered for domestic release and both are fascinating to see each version of this film was presented at the organ loft in salt lake city with live theatre organ scores provided by artist blaine gale a live recording was made of these performances and are included on the grapevine video dvd along with the novel and notes about the two versions while the phantom carriage follows the order of lagerlof s novel the stroke of midnight is in some ways easier to follow seeing the two different edits is an education in how silent films could be changed effectively for release in different countries some viewers look at this film as a horror film which it certainly is not this is a morality play with shades of the supernatural used to hit home its stark message the directing and lead performance by the great victor sjostrom were way ahead of their time it s easy to see why m g m brought him to hollywood to direct such films as lillian gish in the scarlet letter and the wind as well as lon chaney in he who gets slapped in america he was known as victor seastrom he would also star in the lead role of ingmar bergman s wild strawberries giving a masterful performance bergman was greatly influenced by korkarlen or the phantom carriage in his earlier days this is a powerful film that is well worth taking some time to discover and study the grapevine video release is an excellent way to do this,1
1757,the most irritating thing about dies d agost august days is not simply that nothing happens in this film but that director marc recha has the nerve to pretend that this film is some sort of homage to leftist catalan journalist ramon barnils unless mentioning barnils name a few times constitutes an homage this pretense is an utter fraud you will learn virtually nothing about barnils in this film nor about the spanish civil war 1936 1939 nor about the special role of catalunya in that war you also will not learn about the collective punishment inflicted on the heroic catalan people for years afterward by the victorious and vindictive franco the footage of the catalan countryside is very beautiful of course but dies d agost does not have an extensive and varied enough collection of such scenes to qualify as a travelogue the large number of stills shown not very illuminating images of the forest floor for example is the clearest indication of the paucity of ideas here the aimless drift of brothers marc and david during their camping trip does not produce compelling cinema on the contrary one s strongest impression is of a film made by and for spaced out middle aged hippies don t waste your time read a good book about the spanish civil war instead i recommend felix morrow s scathingly anti stalinist revolution and counter revolution in spain which contains a gripping account of the 1937 barcelona uprising barry freed,0
22192,ok ths film like segal s last few films once again goes beyond the knock em down kick em in the groin shoot em in the face get revenge against the bad guys for hurting my sister s niece s cousin stuff seagal was into for a while geepers steven started thinking and using his bucks to make movies with actual ideas in them sure there is plenty of action in this flick but also some thought and heart it s not an oscar flick but well worth the effort unless the viewer is so into brain dead violence that it hurts to have to think for longer than a second it s worth a rental or two,1
20379,combining the conventions of both western and gothic horror and often directed as if it were an art movie this is one of siegel and eastwood s best collaborations eastwood plays a yankee soldier who after being wounded during the civil war takes refuge in an isolated southern seminary for young women shut away from the world the women project their romantic fantasies on to him and he responds with callous male manipulation but jealousy and resentment raise their heads and he finds himself in a world of brutal revenge and boy is the revenge brutal beautifully shot by bruce surtees and carefully paced the beguiled is a haunting elegant work that seems to have influenced the troubled sexuality of eastwood s own play misty for me and tightrope the film is a gripping depiction of a fierce battle of the sexes and oozes a dreamlike mix of horror and sexuality all the characters are ambiguous displaying traits of both good and evil leaving it up to us to choose whom we should root for don siegel left quite a legacy of fine films behind everything from invation of the body snatchers to dirty harry but though his early black and white pictures have aged well the majority of his colour films seem grainy dated and badly shot his gritty realism must have seemed fresh and kinetic 40 years ago but when viewed today i just don t think they ve stood the test of time the beguiled however is in a different league mature ambiguous and starkly shot it s a shame it isn t more widely known while evolving technology and technique have rendered the majority of siegel s tough masculine action thrillers obsolete the beguiled still entrances audiences today due to it s surreal atmosphere and unique subject matter 8 5 10 better than the similarly themed black narcissus this is in my opinion siegel s best film part horror part drama part sexual odyssey the beguiled is a surprisingly arty film especially when considering that siegel viewed his films to be quote meaningless a large part of the film s artistry is due to clint eastwood who would from this point onwards make an effort to choose mature material,1
15855,an interesting comedy taking place on a train from stockholm to berlin december 1945 one can t help to feel sorry for the poor writer critic who quits his job and jumps on the train to berlin his ambition is to make a difference and to participate in building the new unified europe after the war has ended i like the black and white format of the movie as well as the closed scenery of a train in motion robert gustafsson makes a classic gustafsson role in this movie if you re a fan of him this movie is for you the philosopher wittgenstein through his saying one can never assume that anything is what it seems to be is referenced several times in the movie,1
10231,this movie really is that bad and i m normally a sucker for bad movies but this was too much seeing this is like od ing on pure suck now you may think you ve seen the bottom of the barrel you may have waded through every title from full moon and troma all the movies of edward d wood jr uwe boll albert pyun and direct to dvd flicks from faded men of action you may even have seen death tunnel ghost lake and a vast array of the movies that mst3k covered but in their original form but you do not know truly awful film making until you have seen darkhunters and if you haven t you shouldn t don t bother not only is this movie amazingly poorly written directed shot edited acted and splattered in crude cheap aftereffects first of all it s a pretentious mess but not good greenaway or lynch style pretentious or hilariously messy in an ittenbach or early waters sort of fashion it s the kind of pretentiousness that comes when someone incredibly stupid thinks they ve come up with something incredibly smart sort of like m night shaymalan sp only that man seems like a freakin messiah when compared to this trainwreck and this coming from a rampant shaymalan hater it s also boring not heavy going type boring which is okay if the movie awards your patience darkhunters does no such thing it s boring in a oh my fu king god if i see another shot of a cat set to an obnoxious audio cue i am going to fu king kill myself kind of way btw anyone who claims to like this film is a boldfaced liar and anyone who claims this film is complex or deep knows what their mother is like in bed,0
1167,czech movie goers may have enjoyed and rated this film highly because it was czech but i found it to be trite tedious moronic boring and insipid again i suspect ramping in order to increase sales of this dog of a film amazon describes this film as being about a couple of fellows that refuse to grow up but i will go one further i think it is about two fellows that have entered a state of dementia and perform actions that make no sense to anyone i have been told that one of the actors in the film committed suicide after the film and i would believe it when he saw his performance he probably realized what a gosh awful job he had done and realized that the only way to avoid terminal embarrassment was to make the big exit which i am sure was much more dramatic and a much better performance that he had done in autumn spring don t waste your time or money on this pathetic performance it s nothing but a dog in a manger,0
24902,this is possibly the most perfect film i have ever seen in acting adaptation and direction it is self contained and of a kind so there is no point in saying that it is better or worse than other great films just that it can stand by itself as a perfect work of art and it was fun watching confused horror fans getting up and walking out,1
5569,the actresses are cute and the sets while simple quite ok apart from this there is nothing to save from this movie incredibly bad acted dumb to tears dialogues all too expected plot a lot of goofs and inconsistencies for instance a pretty young girl gets hits in the head by a morning star and not only she survives but barely with a scratch to make it short because it does not worth more even the fans of the genre can avoid it,0
1802,ho hum rich good looking kid gets in trouble poor girl falls in love with him jealous ex boyfriend causes tension yadda yadda i actually laughed out loud in many parts of this movie because the next scene was so predictable and just plain stupid as one scene moved on to the next i often found myself wondering just how we got there like i had skipped a few chapters in a book the script was pretty pitiful and didn t have me or my wife caring much about any of the characters except the jilted boyfriend now if the ex boyfriend had gotten an axe and hacked apart the girl and rich kid then then we would have a movie and all the stupid dialog and leaps in plot could be acceptable but since this movie attempts to be touching and totally misses the boat and ends up resorting to the romance equivalent of divine intervention to try and jerk a tear it just falls very very flat avoid this movie clip your toenails instead you will have more fun,0
15058,making this short and to the point this movie was great i loved it i actually picked this up at a hollywood video for 3 bucks on vhs and watched it about 5 times in the last couple weeks i m a big bogart fan and i just latched onto this movie i thought the song was funny and now have it as a ring tone on my phone robert sacchi is great and pulls off a good bogart his nose is a little big his voice is a bogart columbo mix and he does a few things that are awkward but otherwise he was fantastic and this film was wonderful no one can be a perfect bogart but he was great remember sam marlow is a fan of bogart and isn t going to do everything he did he mentions a lot of other movies and does some things that were never part of the real bogart s character s but it s so funny and hilarious and has a great cast including some beautiful women watch it and have fun,1
10453,are you kidding me the music was so loud in this show i could often not even hear the dialog and the music was nothing great anyone know what jake s mother said when he walked in the door and the mushroom cloud looked pretty close to have so little instant devastation anyone research the effects of nuclear fallout before writing this one i felt like a bunch of sit com actors were sent on location and didn t know what to do with dramatic dialog and what does a kansas teen know about shopping in soho couldn t we have had a better line here was bored to tears and only kept awake by the jarring blare of the over mixed way to loud music,0
12428,a remake can be successful an adaptation can be successful it isn t relevant whether its a remake or an adaptation a good movie is a good movie and a poor movie is a poor movie regardless sarkar i am afraid was a very poor movie first of all just by making characters look dangerous or macho they don t bring in an aura about them what was so brilliant about nagre amitabh bacchan s character that we should have been in aura of his power and what showed the benevolence of the character nothing this fact was said by a commentator and amitabh kept giving facial expressions now amitabh can give brilliant facial expressions but why should it mean any thing if there is no history or story to go with it there wasn t proper charecterisation of the characters who worked under sarkar too just because a man had spectacles why should we assume he is wise the flow of the movie was generally dullbecause scenes from the godfather were created like the policeman slapping abhishek bacchan the older brother being killed by abhishek like fredo was killed on instructions of pacino but too much was sought to be packed into the movie with too little story and depth to go with it that was indeed the problem if you try to pack 3 hours of intricate detail like a godfather in 2 hours and that too with few dialogues what you get is a highlights show from a cricket match never making the full impact watching a full match will make,0
13032,if you want to see a true thriller rent this it s not from the director or screenwriter of scream doesn t feature overacting overpaid tv actors passing off as stars and is not a run of the mill special effects bonanza instead you ll get a top notch edgy very strong in violence yet thrilling nailbiter,1
6988,first of all ed wood jr is not the worst director ever plan 9 from outer space not withstanding coleman francis deserves that title i present exhibit b glen or glenda the first half of the movie consists of a surprisingly thoughtful exploration of crossdressing especially since it was made in 1953 the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well this is not to say the movie doesn t have problems bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines poor bela looked like even he wasn t sure what was happening at times the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie the long dream sequence that makes up the middle of the film was totally bizarre more like a vaguely menacing stag film than a dream sequence the alan ann story the supposed original focus of the film has a tacked on quality about it no ed wood jr is not the worst director ever he was able at least for part of this movie to make an earnest social statement when coleman francis tried to do that in night train to mundo fine aka red zone cuba it just ended in chaos glen or glenda is at least watchable without robot help,0
18267,i was blown away when i saw the best years of our lives the acting script and master william wyler s direction winner of best director in 1946 is brilliant this film is about three wwii veterans who come home from the war and are reunited with their loved ones but have to deal with the hardships of coming home from the war the first man al stephenson played by fredric march in his oscar winning role comes home to find his wife millie played by myrna loy and children peggy and rob played by teresa wright and michael hall are more grown up and different than before he left for the war the second man fred derry played by dana andrews has to find a good job and come home to a wife he had only been married to 20 days before he left for the war he begins to find out that she is not the same homer parish played by harold russell in his oscar winning role has lost his hands in the war and must deal with his family s and fiance wilma s played by cathy o donnell reactions to the hooks he has instead of his hands all of these men and their families are reunited in the film in different scenes the stories of these men are all interwoven beautifully together this film truly defines the meaning of a classic this unforgettable drama winner of best picture in 1946 is a film that everyone should see if i was asked to pick a favorite film this would be it out of 10 i would give the best years of our lives an 10 so next time you go to your local video store rent this movie you won t regret it no objectionable material a good family film,1
17765,wallace and gromit are the main characters in some of the best cartoons ever crafted the excellent mix of visual humor and claymation makes a grand day out the wrong trousers and also a close shave some of the best animated footage ever put on television winning several oscars and also countless other awards nick park became quite the popular man in the u k yet his impact on the united states has not been big after the third wallace and gromit short there was all this speculation about a full length wallace and gromit movie yet for years nothing had happened then in 2000 instead of a full length wallace and gromit film we get another brilliant claymation film from nick park which was chicken run which almost got nominated for best picture in the academy awards perhaps it was the success of this film that ultimately drove park to finally work on a wallace and gromit project 5 years later these kinds of films do take long you know and a lot of anticipation wallace and gromit finally hits the big screen despite the rather weak trailers and marketing campaign this movie delivers in so many ways this film will be a delight for both kids and parents with tons of adult humor hidden beneath the brilliant animation wallace and gromit curse of the were rabbit is one of the few films that perfectly manages to equally appeal to both kids and adults this rather difficult technique is one that only pixar has already perfected and dreamworks has had a lot of trouble doing lately despite the dreamworks logo slapped onto the poster this film is mainly from the very creative staff of aardman animations wallace and gromit are first seen running a business that protects the townspeople s crops from being ruined by rabbits which apparently had been running around wild and in great numbers lately their business has gotten them plenty of respect from the others living in the town because a gigantic vegetable contest was rapidly approaching and the crops needed protection complications arise when wallace attempts to manipulate the rabbits into not liking vegetables and then a great eating machine is unleashed on the area it is up to wallace and gromit to find the gigantic animal and stop it from eating away through gardens and also their approval from the townspeople to add to that wallace wants to impress lady tottington which also captured the attention of a snobby suitor by the name of victor simple plot yes but there is more than meets the eye be prepared for a few fun surprises along the way kind of like in the other wallace and gromit cartoons in animated films with little dialogue it is the animation that has to set the pacing and the mood of the film despite requiring 5 years to produce only 85 minutes of footage the payoff is fantastic there is a massive amount of detail that requires more than one viewing to truly notice even more incredible than the detailed and nearly flawless animation is the truly unspeakable amount of visual humor put into the film whether it is a creatively placed shot or normal labels put into the funniest position possible or it is the oh so adorable rabbits that is constantly shown in the film most curse of the were rabbit s humor comes strictly from just watching the movie itself and catching all the references before it is too late just picture the movie madagascar except funnier much fewer pop culture references and better animation casting was great even though in a film with not much dialogue it was not that important peter sallis yet again does a wonderful job as wallace even though in this movie there was no stand out quote that can be used anytime the wrong trousers it s the wrong trousers gromit and they ve gone wrong ralph fiennes does a superb job as the lead villain victor and also helena bonham carter known as the crazy female lead in the cult hit fight club lends her lovely voice as she plays wallace s love interest even though nothing could top the final chase in the wrong trousers curse of the ware rabbit did have plenty of action scenes including one fantastically done chase scene between gromit and victor s evil dog last but not least the rabbits really steal the show at some moments whether it is their cute expressions their funny movements or their howling the rabbits in the film even take some of the glory from the main stars the funniest rabbit in the movie is the cursed rabbit himself to the very end of the movie he had the audience rolling in laughter bottom line despite not being as memorable as the wrong trousers this film is just as good and entertaining as chicken run unlike almost every movie to come out this year the movie does not drag at all clocking in at a short 85 minutes yet containing so much joy and fun it will leave everyone watching it asking for more there is very little wrong with the film it was a pure delight to watch this film is a total contrast of the decent yet vulgar uncut raw movies that have made a surprising amount of money earlier this year 40 year old virgin wedding crashers and sin city and for families and those who want harmless entertainment that is a good thing highly recommend this is the top animated movie to come out this year and among the best we have seen this decade wallace and gromit curse of the were rabbit totally harmless fun from second 1 to second 5

3561,plankton or creatures from the abyss as i m positive it s more commonly known as filmed under as the title creatures from the abyss appears over a moving image in the same font type as the rest of the credits starts with five 20 something kids mike clay rogers his girlfriend margaret sharon twomey sisters julie ann wolf dorothy loren depalm an annoying idiot named bobby michael bon whom decide to all fit into a small rubber boat head out to sea don t ask why as i don t know oh the complete idiot bobby left the petrol behind never thought to tell anyone so it comes as no great surprise that they end up stranded out at sea without any petrol for the motor to make matters worse they become trapped in a thunder storm discover a dead body floating in the water shortly after their luck seems to change when they come across a yacht potential safety in a flash everyone boards the yacht begin to explore first of all they find a scientific lab with various fish specimens computer equipment then down below they find fully furnished luxurious cabins they find a chemist deran sarafian who appears mad can t talk they eat fish from the fridge which makes dorothy puke up green vomit beetles slugs they learn that these fish are living fossil s 1000 s of years old have been contaminated by toxic waste dumped in the sea that they fly mutate bite are generally unpleasant to be around i really can t be bothered to go on with this plot outline so i won t here s what i think this italian production was produced directed by massimiliano cerchi under the pseudonym al passeri i d hide under a different name if i made a film this bad too i think plankton is quite simply one of the worst films ever there are so many things wrong with this film it s difficult to know where to start first the script by richard baumann is total crap it makes no sense whatsoever is so slow dull it was torture for me to sit through why would five people just simply set sail for the middle of the ocean on a rubber dinghy barely big enough to fit them all in what were they planning on doing exactly why do we often get point of view shots from these fish creatures but they seem to be totally invisible to the characters as they are never shown on screen even though they are right next to a character how do these fish get around the boat as there is no water for them to swim in people s actions reactions to things are all wrong they constantly split up they make bizarre decisions that simply don t make any sense in the situation they find themselves in some of the dialogue is as awful as anything i ve heard i could go on all day about all the plot holes ridiculous goings on but i ll run out of space if i do the fish creatures themselves look awful a mixture of rubbish rubber puppets some really bad stop motion animation at the end the scenes where they interact with the human cast also look terrible with some bad super imposition i have heard a lot of comments saying that plankton is gory don t make me laugh forget it there is virtually no blood or gore in plankton whatsoever there are a couple of slimy scenes when bobby transforms into a fish monster while having sex with julie but it s pretty brief he doesn t kill her he just sort of drips slime on her grows a couple of tentacles a fish head comes out of his mouth later on julie s vagina starts to drip some dark slime but that s it we never get to actually see what happens to her or what the slime is dorothy has a fish creature come out of her back off screen control her but again we never get to see what happens to her while margaret commits suicide a very brief shot of a plastic harpoon stuck to her forehead easily the grossest scene is when dorothy pukes up that green stuff with what looks like beetles slugs in it that s it only one person actually dies on screen for the most part plankton is quite tame as exciting as watching paint dry i nearly fell asleep it s so boring i can t see how anybody can like this total crap i just can t the acting is awful the dubbing is awful the characters are awful i hated all of them tecnically plankton is predictably crap as well with an estimated budget of only 250 000 all i can say is where did the money go the sets are monotonous dull with one lab a few cabins the special effect s are bottom of the barrel stuff including the most fake looking exploding boat ever the cinematography is bland the music sucks there is zero atmosphere or tension as a whole plankton like it s name sake is as low in the food chain as it could possibly be i hate plankton it s awful in every single aspect of it s overlong 86 minute duration do yourself a favour avoid this one at all costs unless your either a masochist or insomniac,0
6986,there s a part of me that would like to give this movie a high rating considering that it was made in 1953 this is a very courageous movie about transvestites tackling the issue fairly seriously and sympathetically and offering the viewer a lot of information on the subject and trying very hard not to stereotype the movie clearly makes the point that transvestites are not homosexuals and that aside from wearing women s clothing they lead a relatively normal life it deals with the pain of not being accepted in society the plot revolves around a police officer lyle talbot desperately trying to understand the issue because of the recent suicide of a transvestite so you have to give everyone involved with this movie credit for taking on such a controversial in the context of 1953 subject having said all that i m also sorry to say that this movie is absolutely dreadful in trying to portray glen glenda s edward d wood pain the movie falls into silly and at times surprisingly again given the era sensual fantasies that make the story very hard to follow the acting is wooden at best none of the dialogue comes across as real the actors look and sound like people reading speeches written by others and worst of all there was no point to having bela lugosi in this movie this was another of the increasingly embarrassing roles this poor man took on in the latter stages of his career pull the strings pull the strings poor lugosi s character called the spirit in the credits but really coming across as more of a mad scientist kept crying and nothing he did really seemed to have much connection with the rest of the movie for artistic merit the movie doesn t really deserve much more than 1 10 however for the courage involved in just putting it out i ll give it a 3 10,0
1353,it s about time for a female boxing flick but this one ain t it though the acting isn t too bad the predictable storyline and silly dialogue pretty much ruin this one from the get go to top it off the boxing scenes display zero tension come on how hard is it to make a boxing match seem exciting,0
12473,i could crap a better movie this is a waste of time and money it makes me sick that movies like these are actually getting made and the people making them actually think they re good i happen to like teen comedies when they re done well this movie however takes this genre to a new low with movies like this people think it s actually okay to make this filth and ask unsuspecting people to pay money to sit through it it s sadism,0
7987,i m a fan of judy garland vincente minnelli and gene kelly but this movie just left me cold i was expecting another american in paris from minnelli so perhaps i was expecting too much the movie was short on songs and short of impressive dance numbers i was impressed by the very expressionistic kelly dance as mococo on the ship i was also impressed by the nicholas brothers in be a clown too bad the song was so annoying i also enjoyed judy attacking kelly with bric a brac check lorna luft s autobiography for some interesting information on that scene actually the movie has what must be some of cole porter s most annoying songs especially nina also judy and gene yell constantly like screechy children the plot is thin which is par for the course for musicals but it is not saved by impressive dance numbers or by memorable songs i suspect the best parts of this movie were left on the cutting room floor please some movie restorer find those bits of film and show us what the movie could have been,0

19922,i just watched this movie for the first time after finishing the book last week what s the problem here folks admit that the performances are great i mean lange is stellar and that the film is good looking but it s got less than a 6 i don t get it come on the writing s not that bad having read a lot of pulitzer winning novels and having seen a lot of the films based on them i think a better than decent job was done in bringing the screenplay together i thought the paring down of all the dialogue in the novel was executed almost perfectly this story had a pretty hefty amount of dialogue in it and the story really came through on the screen despite the fact that only a portion of it was used book spoiler part i was however a little disappointed in the ginny tries to kill rose subplot s being omitted i thought that was one of the more emotionally jarring parts of the book but it was probably a good bet to leave it out avid movie goers more than avid readers i think tend to be less forgiving of protagonists pulling antagonistic stuff it s apt to confuse johnny lunchpail and joe sixpack if you loved the book you will like the movie if you hated the book you will likely hate the movie rog,1
395,i watched this last nite with an open mind sorry to say it is still bad first the movie is too noisey and you can t hear what people are saying the accents are bad especially richard masur what is the french chick doing in this film miscasting at its worst walken s makeup is strange the harvard scene is useless and not needed kristoferson s character is unlikeable and i wanted him to get killed and go away meanwhile the walken character gets killed too early and easily despite the makeup the settlers are all stupid get organized you bunch of hicks people are coming to kill you john hurts character provides some humor buts thats all i have nothing good to say about this excessive piece of crap the only good thing is it ruined the director s career and killed united artists still crap after all these years,0
23501,this game has cartoon graphics not much violence and really short levels then why do people say it is so brilliant because it always holds your attention it captivates you and refuses to let go you will try for hours to try and find that damn flight recorder try to work out how to get into the room without alerting the guards etc the levels are short only when you know what to do until that you will spend hours trying to figure out where to find correspondences where to find helicopters and so on and you ll have fun all the while you are doing it well worth a rent,1
18307,tom fontana s unforgettable oz is hands down one of the greatest television series ever created brilliantly written acted and directed it is as close to perfection in any art form film television literature music as it gets haunting in it s extreme brutality it creates a prison world filled with diverse characters that range from compassionate to flat out terrifying it is a show that no matter how brutal it is get through one cannot take its eyes off of the combination of professional trained theater actors with film and television actors allows for a range of diverse and all original performances and while the show is universally praised and has had a loyal fan base one cannot feel that it was under appreciated during it s television run because of other hbo dramas such as the sopranos sex and the city and six feet under and while all those shows are fine and borderline masterpieces in their right many people forget that it was oz that was hbo s first entry into one hour television drama series it was a brave risky first entry and with it hbo hit a grand slam with it this is as good as it gets,1
2923,rented the video with a lot of expectations but it was a disappointment the story didn t make sense the plot was very weak and the special effects well i think even i can do better with my home computer sorry missed a change here,0
918,i m a huge fan of both emily watson breaking the waves and tom wilkinson normal and was amused to see them upstaged by rupert everett dellamorte dellamore in this shockingly rather minor movie that had all the ingredients to be so much more the too brief scenes in which he portrays a languid infinitely entitled worthless son of a rich lord are spot on and entertaining but for a love triangle there was remarkably little chemistry to speak of between anyone the music was annoyingly movie of the week quality and the voice over jarring and totally unnecessary clearly the work of a first time director with a small budget who either lacked or didn t sufficiently heed good advice too bad i can appreciate how the people you kind of hate at the beginning are the ones you kind of like at the end and vice versa so there is some sort of character arc at least in terms of perception for example watson s character while refreshingly honest to her husband about her feelings for another man began to grate on me near the end particularly when she announced to her husband that she simply had absolutely no control over her actions and later when she simply declared that she would be moving back into their marital flat with no asking of permission no apologies offered and i went from disliking wilkinson s control freak moral relativist character to sort of understanding him and not really wanting him to change unlike his wife this movie awkwardly morphed from a whodunit to a love story or steel magnolias illness drama without sufficiently informing me of the fact so i was left distractedly guessing what the next plot twist might be long after they had all been revealed was it the lord driving the car the lord s dog the scene where the lord visits wilkinson and relates how brave watson is the bestest nurse any dying boyfriend could ever ask for florence nightingale incarnate etc was ok until he started over the top sobbing like a baby good god if you ask me she s just another flitty rich person with way too much time on her hands and so she drives her hard working well providing spouse crazy with unnecessary drama her screwing around was just another way to occupy her empty life the dying guy thing was an added bonus for her as it somehow made her previous actions completely above reproach look everyone would have been better off if wilkinson had just left her for his secretary who seemed to appreciate him for who he was instead he acted like an abused dog his open craving for his wife s affection increasing with every kick she gives him i m not anti pc or anything it just didn t ring true even after taking into account all of the harsh realities of middle age we all tend to face the ending for me was and not the director s intention i am certain depressing the movie spent the last 80 minutes convincing me that these two people just don t belong together so i found no joy in the promise of their relationship continuing i m not above wanting my emotions manipulated by a story it just has to be somewhat plausible and not hackneyed is that asking too much my score 4 10,0
12589,s epatha merkerson shines as nanny in this touching and vibrant look at the life of ruben santiago jr marcus franklin while growing up under the guardianship of nanny the film gives a good character study of both nanny and ruben and manages to capture life s ups and downs in a realistic fashion unlike so many memoirs that are made into film the supporting cast adds much spark and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles including mos def macy gray terrence dashon howard rosie perez louis gossett jr liev schreiber jimmy smits ernie hudson delroy lindo and patricia wettig loses some steam and vibrancy towards the end and the ending sequence leaves a bittersweet feeling but overall a great film with a truly outstanding performance by merkerson,1
7734,i bought the dvd to get julia ormond well i got that in spades she was lovely in the romantic scenes too bad bill paxton was flying on autopilot for the whole effort i almost lost my lunch when he popped his big fat white behind out of his flight suit to shall we say engage with julia i realized julia was very proficient in french while watching her in sabrina i watched sabrina with the french soundtrack to see if julia dubbed her own dialog they used someone else in any case julia was chosen for this dutch film over a native french speaker with sufficient english to communicate with the american flier perhaps they wanted at least one familiar name for the british american market to my unfamiliar eye julia s features could pass for belgian the whole film had an odd nature it was a dutch film about belgium in world war 2 i would imagine that national pride would have required a theme of heroic dutch resistance to the german invaders the belgians were much more passive during the occupation period than were the french or norwegians the most savage fighting of all came in the balkans where tito s communist partisans gave the germans fits i noted in another review that dbdumonteil believed julia ormond to be an american instead of the actual british nationality perhaps julia s acting skills were great enough to carry off that impression after watching this film several times it suddenly dawned on me how out of season the film is it is set on junuary 16 1944 when the american plane crashes in belgian farm country the trees look to be in mid fall with lots of leaves and the weather is warm people walk about in light clothing and the grass is still green there is not the smallest trace of snow or ice this must have been the mildest winter in belgium ever the actual plot of the film was a mess where to begin for anyone interested in world war 2 history the film came across as farce the reconnaissance plane used was a huge 4 engine converted bomber such aircraft did exist but they would have required massive fighter escort to have any chance of survival in reality smaller and swifter aircraft were readily available and would have been far more suitable for the task the vital code books in the film would never have been carried on the plane the crew had no need of this information to complete their mission while compromise of this information would have been a huge intelligence defeat even given the premise of the film the first items to be stripped from the aircraft would be the code books they would have been on their way to berlin within 10 minutes of the arrival of german troops at the crash site the daussois home where major brice took refuge was a farm where no one had the least interest in farming food would have been very scarce in belgium at this time the germans would have required substantial quantities of locally produced food to support their forces the family truck would have been expropriated long before the arrival of the american flier there would not have been any fuel available to run it anyway the plot twist where henri daussois turns in the american out of jealousy is pathetic he would have had to reveal all he knew about the resistance in order to be allowed to live he would have had to function as a double agent to frustrate any effective opposition the woman with the secret radio would have never survived the war major brice was caught in civilian clothing toward the end of the film that made him a spy under the laws of war and liable for execution with no defense he would not have meekly surrendered to face interrogation unhindered by the geneva convention better to force them to kill him and spare his friends if possible i have not read the novel upon which this film is based if this film is a faithful adaption it shows an abysmal lack of development in the novel regardless of the novel the screenwriters could easily have produced a superior script that would not waste this opportunity to deliver a much better film,0
17218,i had the pleasure of witnessing this brilliant film at a preview screening in sydney although it was a pleasure to see it pleasure is not the emotion you are left with as the credits roll 2 37 is a film that tackles not just one stigma felt by young individuals but all of them chief of which is isolation it is not just to place the films final galvanising scene on a pedestal above the others but rather it is important to see it as the culmination and from that it is important to realise what it represents to both you as the viewer and to the people directly effected by it 2 37 is not a soft picture but the manner in which mr thalluri handles it s subject matter with a profound dignity and it s no holds barred approach acts as credit to it s message i do not believe films such as 2 37 should be scaled by votes of favour rather it should be recommended to those looking for purpose in their viewing a brilliantly crafted portrait of innocence lost and a master stroke for a as of yet untaped talent not to be missed,1
12994,the sort of little film which studios used to excel at but seldom make anymore sort of a soul version of the more well known the last of the blonde bombshells ian mcshane is excellent as a dj and aficionado of soul music who becomes obsessed with the idea of re uniting the members of a classic soul group and the film follows his exploits as well as those of the group members a cast which includes such genuine musical talent as isaac hayes as well as acting stalwarts taurean blacque derrick o connor and antonio fargas not meant to be an epic by any means this is nonetheless a chunk of solid gold,1
6168,hmmmmmmm cheerleader massacre let me think high school girls get sliced up except the cute one survives got it next movie i was actually surprised this one was made in 2003 i really thought they quit making these movies in the 80 s this was truly your run of the mill slasher movie with teenage eye candy dumb male horn dogs even dumber male adult and hot teacher it continues on the list of dark and stormy night and abandoned cabin in the woods we have seen it all before however this one had a few interesting plot twists that places it above the normal me too slashers so if you have got a few brain cells to fry and 2 hours to kill you could do worse,0
12631,it took a loan out film to columbia for gene kelly s home studio mgm to realize his creative talent and give him some control over what he did in his own films cover girl also became rita hayworth s signature film for the gis and their pinup fantasies during world war ii kelly plays the owner of a small nightclub in brooklyn where rita is a featured dancer and phil silvers the comic of course kelly does a bit of hoofing himself there hayworth comes to the attention of millionaire otto kruger when it turns out that kruger had loved and lost hayworth s grandmother in some flashback sequences from the gaslight era hayworth also plays her own grandmother with jess barker playing the young kruger you might remember jess barker was the husband of that other legendary screen redhead susan hayward broadway producer lee bowman also is attracted to hayward but he s not interested in nostalgia he wants her for his ziegfeld follies revue and in fact the biggest number of cover girl is the title song of the film it s nicely done in follies style hayworth also gets to sing a sure thing in a gaslight era number and in the only song in the show not written by jerome kern and ira gershwin hayworth also does an old english music hall number poor john when i say sing as everyone knows rita mouths words singing here is done by nan wynn the biggest hit of the show is long ago and far away which is introduced by gene kelly it was one of the biggest hits of the world war ii era and one of the biggest sellers jerome kern ever wrote it happens in fact to be a favorite of an aunt of mine who with my uncle will be celebrating 60 years of marriage this september long ago and far away was nominated for best song but lost to swinging on a star what really sets cover girl apart and what makes it a milestone film for gene kelly is the two numbers put me to the test and the alter ego number harry cohn decided to do what louis b mayer had refused at mgm to give kelly creative control of his own material kelly later said the alter ego number was one of the hardest things he ever attempted in his career in it he dances with a pale reflection of himself and the choreography is dazzling and intricate in fact after one more loan out film christmas holiday at universal louis b mayer never loaned out gene kelly for the rest of the time he was at mgm and he did get creative control from then on with that dazzling technicolor cinematography and rita s red hair and gene kelly s boundless creativity cover girl was and is a classic and will forever be so,1
22175,this is the best french movie of the year i saw it twice and i found it great both times i didn t think it boring at all even though it is very long 3 hours i m seventeen so i obviously didn t get to live the events of may 1968 that marked an extremely important turn in french history but it doesn t really matter since i still really enjoyed the film it s actually quite universal people of my parents age can identify to the characters and so can people my age garrel seems to perfectly understand young people the way they think and the complications of love as well as the loss of illusions concerning the possibility of changing the world maybe that s because the character played by louis garrel his son is actually meant to represent philippe garrel himself well anyway great movie no action have to be honest on that point but so strong feelings that you can t possibly stay indifferent to it if you re looking for a relaxing sunday evening movie don t waste your time on this you ll be disappointed but if you like cinema you ll like les amants r guliers which is a bewitching movie close to those made in the 50 s and 60 s by the nouvelle vague artists,1

4555,this is a poorly written and badly directed short film pure and simple what is interesting and keep me watching to some extent was the production values shot on video it appears with a bad script and bad direction one would think it would also have horrible production value that is what the viewer expects when they watch a film that is terrible and shot on video but not in this case they spent some money and it shows it keep me very mildly interested to see what was coming next just to see probably the worst short film i have seen that looked big budget hollywood even though it was shot on some sort of video format instead of spending the sum of money they must have spent for some rather impressive set design it would have been nicer to see a better executed story with some good direction but then again how can we expect new filmmakers to do this when even hollywood won t,0
6943,the female cast of this movie is terrific you ve got linda blair maturing nicely julie strain who doesn t get too many speaking lines that s a good thing rochelle swanson equally convincing as a sweet innocent girl or as an evil possessed girl toni naples and the most beautiful of them all imo the simply stunning kristina ducati how the goofy male lead larry poindexter deserved to get sexually involved with any of these women remains a mystery however beyond the chance to watch these beautiful and in some cases talented women the movie has little to offer the plot is disjointed and doesn t really get going until the last 15 minutes or so and when wynorski finally manages to create some suspense a ludicrous twist ending comes and ruins everything 1 2,0
1077,this movie is very much like every other modern horror movie it s predictable in the way it gets build up and progresses and just never succeeds in bringing anything original or shocking to the screen that s really the biggest disappointment of the movie that overall still had a promising main concept for a movie of its sort you can call this movie a big walking modern horror movie clich it has all of the elements in it that make modern horror movies often not so very great ones to watch one of these aspects is a moaning and very naive little kid why do they keep putting this sort of stuff in movies same goes for the sort of drama aspects that involves the family it just doesn t work out for the movie and is far from interesting or effective it often instead causes the movie to drag in parts and become an annoying one to watch so it has all of the clich s present but it also doesn t succeed at bringing any of these clich s well to the screen as an horror movie this simply is a very poor one it doesn t handle its horror or tension very well for the fans of the genre there is very little to enjoy the movie its story isn t too well connected and build up within the movie too often the movie sleeps in at parts and it doesn t ever allow its horror to fully kick in the movie is also often way too dark no doubt as an attempt to hide its fairly low budget and it shows very little gore as well mostly due to the fact that you simply can not always see things so very well you can just tell by looking at this movie that director j s cardone doesn t has much talent for the genre and doesn t know how to handle its present ingredients properly he did some attempts in the past but all of his movies have failed so far he just keeps trying unfortunately who knows perhaps with the right people behind the camera s like tobe hooper who was initially attached to direct this movie still could had been something decent it s a poorly cast movie with mostly big unknowns in it biggest name of the movie is ben cross but his role is just way too small and in a way also not really relevant enough for the movie and its story it didn t even seemed like he had much fun playing just skip it 4 10,0
22352,it is great to see a new batch of puppets creating havoc in this series i found this chapter a lot of fun in fact it would probably be my second favorite in the series this movie has very little violence and is only rated pg 13 this is notably different from the other r rated puppet master movies which were loaded with gore and violent mayhem the lack of violence does not diminish the fun though this film also has notably better special effects than the last movie in this series good,1
24230,this was an excellent movie i saw this at the karlovy vary iff in the czech republic and it won an award there this is the first film i ve ever seen from jan the director and i was impressed it s a great story about love and family the movie has a great balance of comedy romance drama and suspense all in one i will not give away any of the plot but this is a well made film and i would watch it again if i had the chance the cinematography editing is great the film simply flows and the characters are warm and they are the kind that one can relate to i hope you can enjoy this film as i did if anyone knows where i can find this in the united states or if they plan on releasing it on dvd anytime soon please let me know,1
7312,this comment may technically contain spoilers but it sure doesn t contain surprises my cousin and i rented this the other day hoping to get a good laugh at a typical amateur crappy excuse for a horror movie unfortunately we didn t get too many laughs and we certainly didn t get too many scares either plot outline a plane containing a company head s daughter and some weird piece of technology crashes in an area where our furry friend lives so the company head assembles a team of personalities rather than skilled hunters to recover it for the first 3 4 s of the movie things get pretty boring it mostly consists of shots of big foot lurking in the trees with the party members occasionally hearing him and passing it off as nothing we also see several shots of the party through big foot s point of view and he apparently sees in thermal vision to set up the plot we have to watch sequences of the group sitting around the campfire talking about possibilities to justify the sasquatches existence and actions maybe he can dodge bullets if he sees them coming sure enough we later see he can there are many uncharted lands that the sasquatch may live in maybe this is one of them that was over looked and obviously it is maybe the sasquatch is angry because the plane hit one of his family members and sure enough thats the case along with those scenes there are a couple of oh my god its the sasquatch oh wait its just you scenes and sadly they are among the scariest then finally people start dying well 2 people at least plus the bodies of past victims are discovered the death scenes are pretty lame it mostly just leaves it to our imagination by showing the sasquatch grabbing them then cutting to a different scene but first we are treated to some horrible screams off camera then at last we get to see the protagonist s final showdown with the monster i gotta admit i found it pretty exciting while it lasted but alas it s pretty short lived and after we are treated to an ending that makes a half assed effort to seem cryptic then some closing text with a rather boring conclusion i can t say i recommend this movie it s not quite bad enough to give the mystery science theatre 3000 and its definitely not scary enough and boring to enjoy as a horror movie just don t bother with it,0
24507,i haven t seen this in years but when i was about 6 i first saw this on vhs and i must have watched it at least 10 times now like i said its been awhile so i might screw up the plot but i remember some columbian terrorists taking a prep school hostage with demands for the head terrorist the wishmaster father to be released from prison now i could just check the plot here on imdb but i m pretty sure thats right any way a group of boys at the school decide that they re not gonna just sit around and wait to die so they decide to fight back this film has always been stuck in my mind there are so many images that i haven t forgotten like joey s i think death scene or billy spitting in the terrorists sandwiches or the one kids no idea of his name fake asthma attack just a great film it may be films like this that have given me my tolerance for film violence because if i remember right this movie is pretty graphic guys getting mowed down by helicopter machine guns a special forces guys hand getting blown off by a grenade not sure about that but i seem to remember something like that towards the end and the most bloody being the lead terrorist getting capped in the head in gory detail great action great humor good acting wonderful film experience i ve got to watch this again after all these years,1
17658,this film is one of the historically most accurate war films ever made in that it displays the reality of soldiers in a battle situation as well as the particular circumstances of the battle of stalingrad obvious when one compares this film to works such as anthony beevor s book stalingrad unlike the better known enemy at the gates where the plot diverts into a sniper hunting story this film shows what war can do to individuals although filmed by germans stalingrad is anything but a nationalistic apologetic film it shows that war films can be something beyond flag waving jingoistic distortions of the grim truth of war like so many hollywood war products seem to be the scripting acting direction and other film techniques in stlingrad are of the highest caliber it s a must see film for anyone contemplating to join an army and to obey orders from any type of fuehrer,1
6970,this movie wasted 2 hours of my time and just make me wanna scream lame nicholas stoller write the movie yes man but direct this maybe he should stick with writing i am so disappointed because i heard all the great review i was expecting something like knocked up they say this is from the maker of knocked up why can t i see the resemblance but this just felt like a shallow overdone theme kind of movie for me i am so disappointed actually it s not bad if you consider it as your average chick movie but that character of the band guy just get on my nervesmaybe i was just not paying enough attention to the movie but yeah they have some funny lines and scene but i don t felt the originality and the ending make the movie a little bit better at least the ending is not some boring clich one,0
18259,this may actually the finest film of 1999 no i m not kidding this documentary directed by chris smith captures the very spirit of artistic compulsion smith does the smart thing any documentary filmaker should do he keeps invisible and refuses to judge his subject as the viewer watches mark and his efforts no matter how funkily aggressive they may prove to finish his films he refuses to compromise and suffers repeatedly as a result but lest we forget remember speilberg scorsese and others started just as humbly and what a great subject he chooses mark his family and friends are all fascinating characters far more than any character created in last year s fictitious cinematic products this film oscillates on the dime between comedy tragedy touching sympathy and leads us ultimately to inspiring any viewer with an urge to create despite talent issues to get off their butts and make something the film is about maverick artists and their passions it is also about families no matter how co dependent and disfunctional they may be and how unique and beautiful that organism truly is mark proves in the film to be utterly devoted not only to his dreams but also to his family as well and they to him why this film was not nominated for documentary of the year is beyond me and criminal that is assuming it was eligible last year this film is to be sought out and treasured,1
14628,the third film i got to watch at the philly film fest was this outstanding drama from japan after breaking out of prison nine escaped convicts plan to find the key to the universe that a tenth convict who didn t break out told them about along the way we get to know each of these men fairly well each has their own dreams for much of the movie it seems to be mostly a comedy but a shift takes place that the film ends up a tragedy all of the actors give great performances i can t say much more without spoiling the film but suffice it to say that you end up feeling for some of these individuals at 2 hours this film is a tad to long but good none the less i have no qualms recommending it with the warning that it does have a bit unsettling violence for the tender hearted toshiaki toyoda hit a home run this time out and it makes me want to search out his prior films as well as look forward eagerly to his future ones my grade a,1
2105,this is a perfect example of the 90 s mainstream horror crap nothing is scary here and the film is almost bloodless yes there is some violence but everything is politically correct like in a tv movie this is not a completely bad picture i can safely say that i found it quite enjoyable however a lack of the originality really hurts voodoo all in all if you are a part of the mainstream audience and pseudo horror movies like scream are your favourite then you ll love voodoo but if you want something very gruesome avoid this film,0
1734,oh dear oh dear oh dear my lifetime was drastically wasted by this pile of stink i would rather chew off my arm than watch this film again painful story line painful characters and a painful two hours the best way of describing this movie is a follows i would rather stick pins in my eyes and cut out my brain than watch another minute of this tripe advice is to stay well clear and let your local dustman do you a favour of removing this rubbish lin you told me this was good goodaleebyeload,0
11414,such a bs movie it s just some stupid anti russian propaganda with a completely bs plot not in any way related to the book it looks like the production team got more money from the people who ordered the movie than they will ever be able to get from selling the movie the plot of the movie includes references to some of the real recent events in russian and other parts of eastern europe but puts them in such way that has nothing to do with reality it looks like the movie is a brainwashing instrument which helps to portray russia as a place populated by evil people that always dream about killing someone an of course there are hundreds of stupid mistakes like using the map of ussr instead of russia when running news reports showing a crowd with ukrainian flags and commenting that it s russian elections etc also there are many bizarre episodes i e a character runs though the red square in moscow and in a second he is in downtown sophia bulgaria,0
24830,much said without words this is an excellent movie it was made in color not color as in today s films but a special mono color use with shadings that portrayed meaning mood sense and time it should be seen in color as it becomes an entirely different film the story by nobel prize winner selma lagerl f is effectively presented one never has a clear sense of real memory or phantom changes going on in swedish society at the time are subtly layered most highly recommend try to rent it or find it on line i saw it in a swedish film class and i want to add it to my film library,1
1063,wicked little things has an excellent synopsis empty house beside abandoned mine in woods with tragic past family moves into house and strange things begin to happen little creepy children begin to pop up here and there doing creepy little children things but that is where the cleverness and potential fun ends this group of kids was sealed in the mine many decades earlier and now appear roving the woods poor make up with weapons looking for flesh to eat oh i get it this is a ghost zombie movie hmmm while i can appreciate someone trying something new with this genre this just didn t work what was the children s motivation in seeking to devour flesh why did they need weapons did anyone else imagine the filmmakers all gathered around the daily footage giggling because they felt this was going to be a cool scary movie i found that after thirty minutes i felt the familiar resignation that i had just wasted my time on another modern crap fest while the acting was good and the setting cinematography of good quality as well the script itself suffered from what seems to be a lack of knowledge about the supernatural horror genre altogether a bunch of kids walking down the mall is scarier than this pack of poorly disguised rodents this movie is not scary and while i can appreciate the story perhaps have even enjoyed it if i had read it instead of watched it i still have to say that wicked little things is more accurately called wicked little turd,0
20396,during the civil war a wounded union soldier hides out in a isolated confederate ladies school where the head mistress and the teacher of the school decide to care for him and keep him about until trouble starts brewing between the lonely and sexually frustrated women and girls the soldier decides to take advantage of this situation but it all comes at a price in the end dirty harry 1971 which was made about the same time of the beguiled might be my favourite collaboration between eastwood and siegel but after seeing this i tend to think this to be the pairs finest work together a very atypical savvy and stylish vehicle for eastwood is always on the mark with richly controlled direction by don siegel and a hauntingly rousing music score by lalo schifrin standing out strongly is its sultrily lurid and bleak nature that s intrusively planted into the film s psychological makeup and manipulative strangle hold in sexual depravity it s assiduously played out and makes it more the brooding and blood curdling when those random shocks and saucy intentions take hold with gripping tension the way siegel illustrates john b sherry and grimes grice s alluring bold slow burn screenplay taken from the novel of thomas cullinan is effectively done through stark emotions and the script s tight lyrical context siegel s strong direction captures the idyllically southern victorian setting with such potently garnished photography and he sets up some strangely piercing imagery with great clarity and restrained while the performances are truly commendable and high of quality clint eastwood as the smoothly suave sweet talking chameleon union soldier is very impressionable and delightfully assured a profoundly eminent geraldine page steals the picture as the hardened head mistress and the elegant elizabeth hartman adds a delicate sincereness to her innocent character mae mercer is strongly tailored as the black maid and jo ann harris is the pick of the crop from the young pupils with her seductively sly persona honestly while eastwood s charismatic character plays the field for his own selfish needs there s still mixed intentions there that the one s being played where rivalry between the women creep in turn out to be no better than their guest at the end throughout there s a perversely dark sense of humour and ironic touch settling into the material what s demonstrated here is simply more than your basic little minded shocker but one that s thickly layered with intrigue and a sense of realism that s hard to shake that also goes for its extremely eerie title and closing song a effectively chilling low key item that s hard not to be tempted by it s swinging hospitality,1

14278,i see alot of movies at the cinema 103 so far this year and i have to say that this is by far and away the best film i have seen this year even though it was released back in 1954 i sat in awe and watched this work of genius and felt quite ashamed that i had never even heard of it before my local art house cinema decided to show it for a week on what looked like a new print the best part of the whole movie has to be the 28 minute break in where there is no speech and no music merely the sound of the men carrying out the heist pure quality although really dark in places it is lightened with the dry humour not many films score 10 out of 10 but this does and also gets a gold star for effort if you ever get a chance to see this movie please do not hesitate it s a classic,1
15287,i resisted watching 15 park avenue despite of recommendations discarding the movie as a clich d topic of extreme emotional dramas and over the top acting once in a while movies like 15 park avenue come by and sweep you off your feet the movie grasps your attention pretty early on and there is no moment to rest after that aparna sen has done a wonderful job of gluing the audience to every line of the movie the impeccable character development just right amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to match it all i have a renewed respect for konkana sen sharma who convincingly plays the schizophrenic mithi she beats expectation yet again after page 3 and mr mrs iyer prof anjali s role is very well developed and shabana does full justice to the character rahul bose shefali chaya waheeda rehman add incredible flavor to the movie i define shower moments as thoughts of scenes from a movie that you ponder over in your shower endlessly till your wife girlfriend mom bangs at the door 15pa delivers many shower moments especially the conversation between anjali and her mother where the mother is cautious when talking to anjali about her thoughts it immediately brings out anjali s personality to the audience the end is a very bold statement by the director probably too westernized for the indian audience yet delivers the elements to promote the movie from a good to a great status,1
20704,this movie was the second movie i saw on the cinema as a child it scared the living crap out of me so much so that i asked my father if we could leave halfway through nowadays the only people leaving halfway through are the ones who have a good taste in movies i however still have fond memories of this flawed masterpiece of awfulness doug mcclure and peter cushing in the same movie great monsters made of polypropylene substitute scary stuff a rubber monster is when you think about it is even scarier than a real monster the astonishing thing about this movie is how good the score is truly rousing stuff there s also plenty of prehistoric tit on show too nice,1

14303,yeah i read david lee roth s autobiography crazy from the heat which by the way is an amazing read and dlr says this was his favorite blacksploitation movie as a kid in fact he says he always imagined himself as a black guy in southern cal mr roth is quoted as saying we saw every blacksploitation picture and those movies were a huge influence on me trouble man superfly foxy brown shaft cleopatra jones blacula rudy ray moore doin his dolemite vibe i saw all of those he goes on to say dolemite rudy ray moore was one of the originals he was a blue comic doing blue humor like redd foxx did on early party records so he was the most perfect to play a new secret agent his answer was not bonds james bond his answer was dolemite motherf we would wait for that line in all of his movies get whitey would show up in every single movie at least once and we would wait for that too they had the cars they had the shoes they had the guns the haircuts the slang and the scams and we all knew that all those beatific resolves at the end of the movie were white bull he s trying to feed hungry children but he s actually a pimp bull that was designed to make it palatable to our moms and dads so they d let us go see the picture spoken like a true genius so upon reading about dolemite in mr roth s book i immediately bought in on dvd and i really like it yeah it s super low budget and yeah i hate rap but as a fan of tarantino movies i can see many similarities especially some of the 70 s fusion funk ala jaco pastorius music throughout the film i also love the scene where the two cops bust him for coke and then one of them snorts a whole bunch of it like he d done it a thousand times before and says something like aww yeah that s the real mccoy and then he continues to talk and has a little bit of coke still on his lip classic some of the violence is a little over the edge but shocking which i would consider to be a positive quality not as predictable as i assumed it would be definitely going to pick up the human tornado very soon 10 out of 10,1
24403,fourteen of the funniest minutes on celluloid this short parody is at least as much a part of the star wars saga as phantom menace and far more entertaining if you ask me hardware wars was the first in a long line of sw spoofs which form their own subgenre these days i hate to describe it too much it s so short that the premise is just about the whole thing suffice it to say that many of the most popular and familiar aspects of star wars have fun poked at them household appliances such as toasters and vacuum cleaners portray spaceships and robots the princess anne droid character wears actual bread rolls on her head instead of the famous coils of braided hair and fluke starbucker is even more of a dork than his original if that s possible ernie fosselius is one crazy son of a buck he s also the source of porklips now the apocalypse now spoof,1
5917,i lived next door to the author in 1980 when he first moved out to portland from downer s grove ill with two of his high school buds he seemed like a normal enough guy though he had a lot of artistic pretensions within a few years he jumped into portland s post punk music scene with buddy phil and a few others and a band that definitely wasn t headed anywhere although it got him a lot of action including a fling with courtney love in her portland groupie days he seemed to think his musical prospects were good enough to move to san francisco then n y c i was surprised to hear that he got a publishing deal in 95 after the band crashed and burned courtney love s name seemed to be the clincher i have no idea how the movie came about especially with this cast but i doubt that gus van sant was involved anyway the reviewers here seem to be unsure whether the lack of narrative focus is intentional or not so i would just say that this is the work of a fairly intelligent guy who wants to be a writer or artist or something but doesn t have anything to say like kerouac without the benzedrine,0
3391,this dvd is barely 30 minutes long and has dull interviews that reveal that the average slipknotian has an iq of around 30 but these aspects are the least problematic here the real trouble is that slipknot is one of the least talented metal bands to ever sell over 100 000 units of their crap the only reason i say one of the instead of the is because system of a down are even worse much like ed gein s girlfriends this band s music is pieced together from age old metal clich s which are to be found in both their image and their ultra dull music in fact their image is kind of fun their videos are like snippets from cheesy horror films hence they fulfill at least some purpose as entertainment their music however consists of nothing of quality whatsoever just a bunch of gimmicky heard them a million times before played solely at the guitar neck riffs that are in no way related to each other and yet are randomly grouped together to form songs that have no cohesion no highlights no nothing but if the riffs are truly bad then the vocals are even worse slipknot s singer has a stereotypical hence uninteresting evil growl the kind 90 of all metal bands today have but that is nothing compared to when this deluded hick starts trying to sing still what could one expect rule no 39 of the nu metal handbook says quite clearly you will alternately growl and sing ignore the fact that the two styles don t mix well because most of your fans are so tone deaf they will love you even if you into the microphone slipknot are at their absolute worst when their singer starts belching out melodies but back to their image it s stolen copied ripped off nicked borrowed taken without asking from none other than mr bungle you ve never heard of them of course you haven t you only listen to nu metal and mr bungle is quite far from that and beyond any categorization anyway they too wore masks grotesque horror ones similar to those of slipknot i might add in the late 80s and early 90s this band whose frontman is mike patton from faith no more never hit it big because their music wasn t directed toward the average music fans to put it mildly so basically slipknot aren t even original in the image department they have nothing at all new to offer hence will be forgotten in several years once the masks become boring to the legions of their zit faced fans which is when slipknot will be forced to compete in the music market solely with their generic music speaking of mike patton it s interesting that a number of nu metal bands often site his singing as a major influence predictably and thankfully patton is not flattered by this and has denied being in any way proud to have been an influence for one of the worst metal sub genres ever having said that enjoy this short dvd and the cheap thrills it might provide to the untrained ear and bored eye and then polish those slipknot posters because in a few years no one will be taking care of them the poor dears having seen corey in the documentary get thrashed i finally understand why he wears a mask he is a blue eyed baby faced ginger looking like dave mustaine s younger brother not exactly scary for more of my music world rants go to http rateyourmusic com collection fedor8 1please punish me hard very hard by clicking no below that ll teach me,0
15775,brilliant film i am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like pulp f but thats how it is with post pulp era many pictures get automatically likened to it for only being a gangster flick but this one is well written funny coincidences ordinary gangsters who are family men resemble something from tarantino which is a good similarity anyway the film s about a guy bloke in australia which is getting mixed up with a hard core crime gang and ends up in a debt and deep s it to his assistance is his deceased brother anyone remember val kilmer in true r to pay of his debt and escape from the gangsters who are on his trail the gangsters are cold blooded but take the time to play chess and focus on the upbringing of their children they also get served tea from their granny while planning a bank robbery and have trouble what to do with their kids during the robbery so a humorous gangster flick with heath ledger in good form though i m not a fan and bryan brown in great action as a gang leader,1
15131,this episode is not incoherent like another person said the source agreed to help because he was not going to keep his word if you pay attention he says after she phoebe agrees to stay down there in hell get rid of her and balthazor so i don t have to worry about them in the future and also he didn t let cole warn the sisters like phoebe asked in exchange of accepting the deal that s why prue died because she got hit harder than piper and on the head and there was no phoebe to call for leo this time and in the past leo said that she almost got herself killed pay more attention next time and there is not a to be continued after this episode it is the ending of season 3 and on season 4 they can t show anything from prue because she owns the rights of it prue so the producers would have to pay her for whatever they show this is the last episode she is in,1
11458,the selection of the bloated boring and racist cimarron ranks as the worst choice for best picture in oscar history poorly acted particularly by the justly forgotten richard dix whose performance as the self centered and irresponsible yancey cravat ranks as one of the most narcissistic characterizations in screen history and leadenly paced the film is truly shocking today because of the racist slant towards its one black character who is introduced by being shown sleeping in a chandelier other comments by imdb reviewers have dismissed the attitude towards this character as being merely dated but many films that appeared during this period did not depict blacks as shuffling lazy mental deficients in the manner that this behemoth takes great delight in so that argument seems weak to say the least but whether you regard this demeaning characterization as in shockingly bad taste for anyone at any time or merely the forgivable ignorance of a less educated era it is very painful to watch with 21st century eyes but even this might not matter if the film weren t the overlong bore that it is voted the best picture oscar at the 1930 31 academy awards when such enduring classics as city lights the public enemy dracula the dawn patrol and the blue angel failed to be nominated cimarron is by far the worst selection to join the oscar pantheon,0
24072,greetings again from the darkness director alejandro amenabar creates life against all odds in this based on a true story version of one man s struggle to control his destiny the great javier bardem is fascinating to watch in his role as ramon his eyes and head movements leave little doubt what is going on in his mind the dream and fantasy sequences are not overused so prove very effective in explaining why he wants what he wants rather than force us to answer the euthanasia question the real question posed is what is love at every turn we see people in love looking for love or dying to be loved the script is tight and keeps the film moving despite being filmed mostly in one room the supporting cast is wonderful and we truly feel their pain and how each family member deals with ramon s decision this is a gem and deserves to be seen,1
15507,i give this film 8 10 overall visually a great deal of it is nothing short of stunning an art director s dream mix of hieryonomous bosch salvador dali frieda kahlo and georgia o keeffe and a valid testament to the power of film as a serious art form beautiful use of color form imagery environment and fabulous set decoration combine with state of the art computer graphics so 10 10 for that wow the plot line is well more predictable you know they ll save the girl and get the killer in the end but the story is still interesting and pacy enough to pull you in and keep you there 6 10 for that squirm factor i won t give this a rating but the film certainly made me squirm and i was watching it on video on a tv screen it would of course have a great deal more impact on a big screen graphic violence of a twisted erotic nature in a surreal landscape even if beautiful is highly unpredictable the world inside the killer s head is not thank goodness my world because i watched this film on video i was able to replay a couple of sequences and found much to admire the second time around when i wasn t so nervous about where the scene might be going and i suspect the whole film would be worth seeing a second time just for the visual art general suggestion don t take the kids or conservative grandparents to this one but if you re keen on the visual look of films like surrealist art don t mind a bit of kinky gore and just want to take a bit of a mind trip this one s a winner oh and if you re keen on babes jennifer lopez is pretty hot,1
2738,fellow noir devotees be not deceived this is a stinker poorly filmed poorly acted and there is nothing nothing here for the film buff looking for yet another solid b movie from the goldmine of the 40 s 50 s era of classics i gave it a try based on the relatively high rating on imdb there s no accounting for taste but i found nothing in this movie to recommend to other imdb members this is a classic example of having watched a movie and feeling like you have been cheated out of x number of minutes that it took the movie to get to its thankful demise to have alan ladd on the cover of the dvd tape is nearly fraud he is on camera less than two minutes and has almost no dialogue this isn t this gun for hire folks it is a classic in the lousy sense of the studios cranking out fodder on no budget we all search for the great ones save your time on gangs inc paper bullets it is lousy,0
4079,you re in the navy now is painfully bad very likely the worst movie gary cooper ever made it s supposedly based on a true story but the incident which inspired this film doesn t seem to have enough plot to sustain a feature length script i saw this movie on local television while i was house sitting for my mother in law in long island new york there was a raging blizzard outside and i was literally snowbound if i d been able to get out the door i definitely would have stopped watching this movie there are some interesting names in the supporting cast notably charles bronson under his original name lee marvin harvey lembeck jack webb and jack warden forget it everybody stinks in this movie even the usually reliable millard mitchell is awful lee marvin and jack warden are onscreen so briefly there s no point in your watching for them gary cooper plays an obscure naval officer who is assigned to command a ship which is powered by a new experimental steam turbine basically the whole ship is a giant teakettle cooper realises that the assignment is not a prestigious one if it were it would have gone to a better officer cooper was a good actor in dramatic roles but he simply had no ability for comedy he made several bad comedies and this one is his worst jane greer has always bored me and she bored me more than usual here this ship went down with all hands and sank without a trace have i mentioned that this movie stinks i ll rate you re in the navy now one point out of 10 toot toot,0
22287,where do i begin i first saw this film in 1995 and had no idea of what to expect i was actually at the time searching out films that elijah wood had starred in and this one had come highly recommended i sat down and watched the film once and didn t know what to think i watched it a second time a few days later and the floodgates just opened never before in my life had i ever really cried while watching a film and i was blubbing every high and low the film i was riding right alongside on an emotional roller coaster it struck such an emotional chord in me on many levels the intense sadness and elation we see in the film the wonder and innocence of childhood the yearning for a time that once was but is no more more than anything this film reminded me of my childhood except for the abuse during a time in my life when i d shrugged off my childhood some years before and not even really noticed i d given it up and moved on to a life entirely devoid of it the radio flyer made me wake up and suddenly realise what i d given up without really even noticing from that day forward i immediately set about to change my life and myself and i did this is going to sound corny but basically i rediscovered my inner child i started down a path that has been ongoing over the past 6 years and has changed me so much so much for the better embracing and living that part of myself i ve been finding out who i really am i don t think it was simply a case of the right film coming along at a crucial moment of my life the radio flyer really did something very special and i still look upon it as an incredible piece of work in all respects an incredible film in closing i cannot fail to mention the music i am a great fan of hans zimmer and this is among his very finest works the sheer breadth and depth of emotional expression he has put into the score of this film is a huge part of what makes the film what it is to me like subtitles to a foreign language film his soaring music is a crib sheet to the intense emotions this film will take you through find the soundtrack at all costs it was sadly deleted long ago i never expected to find it but amazingly did after chatting with someone i met on a hans zimmer fansite guest book watch this film let yourself live the emotions don t get bogged in trivial nitpicking of the ending be that child again,1
15699,there won t be one moment in this film where you aren t laughing this is mel brooks at one of his high points and cary elwes carries off the part of robin with convincing humour every time you watch this film you will discover a new joke but the ones you have noticed before will never grow old highly recomended,1
2976,when a stranger calls belongs to the group of this year s remakes with movies like poseidon just over the horizon director simon west con air helms this updated version with plenty of relative unknown casts which signals either the death rate is high it isn t or that established stars are steering clear from a potential turkey clocking in at a relatively short 87 minutes it s primarily made up of two acts the first which takes a full one hour is the setup our heroine jill johnson camilla belle chalked up 800 minutes of talk time on her mobile phone do the math and as a lesson in responsibility her parents had confiscated her mobile and grounded her to pay off her debt she works part time as a babysitter and looking after the wealthy mandrakis kids is her first stint the huge mandrakis mansion gets a full tour treatment as it is where all the action will take place plenty of rooms makes for good hiding an indoor pool sized aquarium pond to get wet in for the wet t shirt treatment and check this out motion detector lights which you just know will contribute to the scares with the manipulation of lights and shadows naturally prank calls red herrings are aplenty which chalks up this act s runtime but most of them fall flat in the suspense department there s a minor trend emerging with actors being the unseen providing and acting through their voice instead recent attempts include edward norton in kingdom of heaven and hugo weaving s v for vendetta here lance henriksen does the honours for the anonymous nameless psychotic killer but it just falls flat why the script doesn t give him much dialogue most of the phone calls made were of the silent mind masturbatory nature which i felt was a waste they could have also casted some unknown instead and the job will still get done the second act where the main action takes place is too little too late and the bogeyman well is purely a bogeyman those expecting blood and gore will be disappointed as basically it s a one woman show to hold your attention in the first hour eye candies always succeed and this act will have her resolve everything in double quick time ala rachel mcadams in red eye don t expect any form of character development nor subplots that will engage the ending tried to be too smart for its own good and came across as a cheap way to end the movie there s not much of goodness to highlight from this movie no scares no thrills no enigmatic villain and plenty of security flaws especially with that door alarm the only thing it s good for is to provide a number for 4d,0
5575,this is a stupid movie like a lot of these karate movies it is badly written awkward and sometimes just stupid the action really isn t all there and the movie overall leaves much to be desired everyone here is talking jive doing bad karate and doing a very bad job of acting watch for scatman crothers in a small role he is too good for this movie overall jim kelly is good at karate but he is a terrible actor gloria hendry is real bad all of them are there are just so many parts to this film that make absolutely no sense the supposed love running away scene with hendry and kelly what the hell was that they destroyed that man s guitar for no reason and then there was the mandatory girls on trampolines now what was that they were in the movie for five seconds then you never heard from them again then there is the whole racially charged element of the movie which is cool and all but in this movie it goes absolutely nowhere like i said this is good for a laugh one time but don t watch it again,0
21350,this film had a distinct woody allen feel about it so if you re not a fan of dry humor dark humor or back handed humor you probably could find something else to do if you are however this is quirky with some nice twists and a flowing natural dialog the story itself is quite engaging not quite like a train wreck from which you cannot disengage your eyes but close i mean that in the best way possible the intrigues are plenty the twists are enough to fully engage the senses and the characters are downright lovable i had a great time with this movie it rates an 8 3 10 from the fiend,1
12313,the title doesn t make much sense to me i m not sure what door in the movie shouldn t have been opened the movie starts uneventfully with a conversation between a man and a woman in a room that looks like a richly furnished train car complete with the sound of the train traveling in fact the man s house is a train car and he has a cassette of train sounds the woman leaves and calls a young woman the young woman tells her boyfriend a doctor that she s been told her grandmother is ill and she needs to return to her home town she hasn t been there in thirteen years flash back to thirteen years ago a shadowy figure enters a house he caresses a sleeping young girl then goes into another room and stabs the girl s mother the girl wakes up and enters her mother s room and finds her dead with a knife in her she screams and an arm comes out of nowhere and claps a hand over her mouth she looks up in fear that early scene in the movie of the killer muffling her scream and the girl s look is one of the few effective shots in the movie it doesn t have much going for it in the visuals department occasionally there s some strange use of sound and there s some weird lighting in an attic scene where many of the panes of glass are red and blue back to the present day the young woman arrives in her grandmother s house an old doctor is there who she doesn t trust along with the man from the opening scene judge and kearn the town s museum operator she doesn t trust any of them and it s true they don t inspire any trust she s rather crabby throughout the whole movie she wants to check her grandmother into a hospital the men in the town want her house and the museum operator wants the things in it his museum is already filled with many of the grandmother s things inexplicably the woman wants to keep the house the young woman starts getting phone calls from a man speaking in a sinister whisper he makes various threats and wants her to do things to arouse him such scenes recur often unfortunately there are so few characters in the movie that the possibilities of who it could be are limited worse still we see right from the beginning who is making the phone calls so while the young woman doesn t know even though the caller occasionally drops into his normal voice the audience always knows no suspense each call rattles her more and more the ending was unexpected for me so maybe gets points for not going with the obvious but i m not sure i cared for it,0
1585,a friend of mine who is even more into 1970s cult films than myself recommended this one to me and in fact gave me the copy of it that i watched however i was not as enthusiastic about the result as he or for that matter michael elliott was the film is a hybrid of house of wax 1953 and the texas chain saw massacre 1974 indeed i would venture to say that it served as the basis of the 2005 remake of the former much more than the original did so we have a remote and derelict wax museum of incredibly lifelike dummies guess why that is with its apparently harmless curator a hammy chuck connors being invaded by the obligatory group of stranded teenagers among them tanya roberts he also has a mad brother shades of psycho 1960 incorporated for good measure down to the self same twist who is supposed to be a mechanical genius showcased in a poltergeist which unaccountably accompanies the first murder the film does benefit from a pino donaggio score but being so derivative and not especially well made to boot essentially ends up merely a redundant and fairly muddled genre effort,0
3672,this is a children s tv series about a mary sue who is at the same time mean and bitchy i couldn t bring my self to sit through 3 episodes of zoey101 not to mention that jamie lynn spears can t act to save her life what message does this show bring to kids if you re not perfect like zoey you re unworthy rollseyes it s absurd how zoey s character is exactly the type of person who would be despised in real life yet she manages to become so popular then there is chase who is basically a lovesick puppy who worships the ground zoey walks on then there is the fact that all the other characters seem to have been dumbed down in order to stop them from outshining zoey i m sorry but the characterization in this show extremely unrealistic,0
19079,dogtown and z boys is a documentary about the zephyr skateboarding team and their influence on skateboarding it also focuses on the history of skateboarding it was directed by stacy peralta a member of the original zephyr team and was written by stacy peralta and craig stecyk another member of the team the documentary stars the members of the zephyr team and is narrated by sean penn the documentary talks about the beginning of skateboarding and how it evolved from surfing it discusses skateboarding s popularity in the late 60s and the 70s its decline in the 80s and its rebirth in the 90s skateboarding was introduced in dogtown the nickname of the poor side of santa monica california the zephyr team originated from the zephyr surf shop which manufactured the first modern skateboards the documentary mainly consists of the original zephyr team members talking about the past in the zephyr team the competitions they won and their popularity and prestige it focuses on three particular members of the team peralta tony alva and jay adams three virtuosos of skateboarding and probably the best three members of the team the interviews in the documentary were usually voices over archival footage from dogtown in the late 60s and 70s very rarely to you actually see the people being interviewed but when you do they are shown in black and white while the archival footage was in colour i think stacy peralta used this technique to show that the documentary was about the past i e the glory days of the zephyr team and not the present the documentary is very fast paced in that we often see clips of impressive skateboarding over up beat music of the era such as jimi hendrix led zeppelin and david bowie and the interviews tend to be quick and to the point knowing nothing about skateboarding i e not even knowing how to ride one straight along the ground i was very surprised that i found this documentary so interesting the reason is that this doco was more about the zephyr team than the actual sport of skateboarding so while i couldn t relate to skateboarding i could relate to the boys in the team because it was made by actual members of the team it gives it a little more depth and authenticity all in all i would have to say this is one of the best documentaries i have ever seen it gave me a whole new insight not just into the zephyr team but into skateboarding as a whole for those who love skateboarding i can only imagine how it must be even more interesting seven and a half stars out of ten,1
15914,even for sci fi this movie is movie is a little out there alright more than a little my first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind don t watch this movie expecting another darko darko fans are never going to like another richard kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards donnie darko is a thing of the past get over it richard kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the deeper meaning the first time you watch them to be honest i had to watch the box twice before i liked it the deeper meaning to spare you a bunch of sociological psycho babble humans are self serving we make decisions that can destroy our lives and don t open mail without a return address summary creepy old man tells cammeron diaz if you push the button i will kill someone you don t know and give you a million bucks of course she pushes it and as promised by the creepy old gets a case of money then the movie takes a dive into the unusual to spare my fingers the typing for pushing the button diaz and her husband are cursed by supernatural alien beings in an elaborate experiment to gage the morality of the human race i liked the willingness of the movie to ignore the generic movie guidelines its different its intense it has a deeper meaning although its philosophy 101 material it leaves you guessing not a hollywood ending i disliked why would any being with the technology to inhibit another life form devise such a ridiculous scheme what god like alien has the patience for that diaz was good but was there a need for the country accent they live in virginia i give it a 7 because kelly didn t put as much attention to detail as with his other movies overall good flick,1
17006,one cannot help but admire mike judge for his hands on i ve experienced that approach with office space almost anyone working a job could associate with the characters idiocracy has exactly the same feel to it one can easily appreciate the 505 years later experience of our heroes because again the director has tried to put things on a very human level somewhat similar to woody allen s sleeper this movie is very funny do not miss the deleted scenes as the museum of fart is a classic imaginative comedy is a rarity and idiocracy is wildly imaginative extremely funny and a solid 8 0 movie experience merk,1
11279,comparing this movie to anything by almodovar is an insult to almodovar the best thing i can say about it is it tries desperately to be like an almodovar movie and fails miserably the script is dreadful the characters are one dimensional and the performances are the quality of high school drama except marcia gay harden s which is pretty good given the material she has to work with furthermore the cinematography does absolutely nothing to convey the whimsical beauty of gaudi s architecture or the infectious charm of barcelona if you enjoy the grit pathos and dark quirky comedy of almodovar s movies you ll find none of them here spend your money on something other than this waste of celluloid,0
1917,heart of darkness was terrible the novel was difficult enough to understand but when a production company decides to release a film loosely based on it then that just messes everyone up not only did those in charge decide to change certain characters and completely eliminate others but the acting was horrid and the overall impression i got from the movie was that it was a complete dud i watched the film in hopes of understanding the novel a bit better but it just threw me and my fellow classmates off completely i think the movie was a waste of time and i was disappointed to see tim roth in such a disappointing film especially when he has awesome flicks like pulp fiction and resivior dogs under his belt same with the very cool john malkovich,0
2590,why is it that such romantic movies that never actually go anywhere always start and probably end with crappy jazz it s not clever and it makes it look like a bloody tv movie this film was sappy slow paced boring unoriginal wooden and did i say boring harrison ford was probably trying to be mysterious and crude but he was just a crawling mumbling cop that seemed to walk into the congress woman s home like everything was fine when he behaved like a pervert staring at thomas with a pervy glare hardly ever bothering to speak and why the hell do they always get british actors to put on crappy accents they re casted because they re famous and everybody knows they re british precisely because they re famous,0
12824,apocalypse now redux francis ford coppola s war opus is probably the most beautiful war film i have ever seen capt benjamin willard martin sheen is a vietnam soldier who is tapped to head a very dangerous and highly classified mission into cambodia to terminate the position of col kurtz marlon brando a highly ranked and highly regarded army man who seemingly has gone completely insane and defected from the army setting up his own little society and helped by a cultish following of soldiers escorting him up the river to cambodia is a handful of navy men and along the way they encounter several interesting people most notably is robert duvall s kilgore a badass lieutenant colonel with a few screws loose and some horrifying situations apocalypse is less historical war film than a philosophical and psychological study it is more full metal jacket than platoon the running time of apocalypse is over three hours but the film is so wonderfully paced and compelling that when the end of the film arrived i was actually surprised at the amount of time that had passed the beautiful cinematography is surely what stood out the most for me however after seeing this film i am convinced that coppola is one of the masters of light and photography in film history the godfather films were all tinged with an almost sepia tone and shadows created the feeling of a baroque composition with apocalypse there is an incredible usage of natural light and the shadows particularly in the scenes involving brando and sheen almost become a living character they are so pervasive and effective another gorgeous scene was when cpt willard and jay hicks frederic forrest were in the jungle looking for mangoes and come across a tiger the sheer enormity of the surrounding foliage leaves as big as a house made the characters almost lilliputian but the colorization of the scene was incredible while everything else was almost a muted grey the leaves were an incredibly vibrant green an effect that was particularly striking another really minor positive moment in the film was the great scene when the helicopters carrying duvall and company attack the small village while playing wagner this could have just been an ultra dramatic underlying soundtrack to the scene but instead coppola turns the song into an actual part of the scene with duvall mentioning that he likes to play it while they are approaching to scare the hell out of them the performances in apocalypse are first class much has been made of the amount of money brando earned for the film and the amount of trouble he caused regardless of this he turned out a powerful performance for a relatively short amount of screen time sheen is completely outstanding this is the first time i have seen him really unleash in a film and duvall is a lot of fun to watch as the loony kilgore apocalypse now is a film that is so pervasive in pop culture by now most know several choice lines from the film i love the smell of napalm in the morning et al but i knew little enough about it that there were plenty of surprises left to experience i have not seen the original cut of apocalypse now so i cannot compare it to this newer cut but this is a film that should most certainly be experienced 8 10 shelly,1
5986,in the 1930s hal roach studios was on top of the comedy world with such stars as laurel and hardy charley chase and the little rascals most of these films are exceptional and have withstood the passing of time however a lesser known roach product was the pairing of thelma todd and zasu pitts later todd was paired with the equally untalented patsy kelly try as i might i just can t stand these pictures they just aren t funny plus unlike laurel and hardy there was not an ounce of chemistry between todd and her two co stars before you just think i am a crank understand that i have seen and reviewed several hundred roach films as well as many other early comedies so i am well acquainted with the genre and within the genre this team is among the worst part of the reason i think i am right about the team is that as a lower tier team at roach they were given all the scripts no one else wanted if stan or ollie hated a given plot idea it was often given to todd and pitts kelly and usually it showed in this film however the team is at their absolute lowest it s hard to imagine a comedy with less laughs and a more contrived plot the film begins with zasu in the jury and thelma as a defense lawyer as for zasu she s a completely annoying moron not the lovable type moron like stan laurel or lou costello but just a totally annoying and grating person who is pushy and obnoxious as for thelma as usual she s the rather bland straight man and as such has little to do but react to zasu s boorish behavior the plot involves thelma defending a client who is accused of selling exploding diet pills considering that the pills are highly dangerous when the attorney asks zasu to try swallowing one it just seems dumb and while they were called pills they were more like giant black blobs that were larger than golf balls swallowing them only seemed contrived and made no sense even for a low brow comedy when they find she has swallowed the pill and it really is explosive everyone panics and runs about like idiots until the film ends as i said i am not a fan of this team however even for those who want to like the film there isn t one legitimate laugh in the entire short when i talked over this review with my wife who also saw the movie with me she thought my score of 2 was overly generous,0
2645,ya know what family guy started out as something fresh funny and more original the random humor used to be funny i actually used to think it was the best animated sitcom next to the simpsons after watching the new episodes that aired for the past few weeks i grew fed up with the show relying too much on random humor to be funny south park was right about fg dead on when they brought up the manatees and the idea balls and watching the show itself i don t understand why my parents like it so much there s nothing great about it the intellegent humor is funny and would ve been funnier if the show didn t rely on randomness,0
22084,this two disc set is incredible if you re like me and never had the opportunity to actually see the band live then this is the next best thing jimmy page who in my opinion is the second best guitarist ever to walk the face of the earth second only to slowfingers himself he puts on an amazing show in every piece of footage in this film john paul jones although not as up front as page puts on one hell of a show although in the live atmosphere his rythmic bass lines aren t as defined as they are on studio recordings except of course in songs like dazed and confused or what is and what should never be but his wide array of instumental talent is well displayed in these dvd s john bonham is john bonham what can i say there is no comparison his beats stand out like no other and this dvd is proof last but not least robert plant wails like no other can wail if you ve ever read hammer of the gods you ll be wondering the same thing as page was when he first met robert plant why the hell isn t this guy already famous and so concludes my review sorry about and spelling or grammar mistakes zeppelin rocks,1
18906,in a sport that prizes quirkiness and treasures it s characters one of the greatest of them from the 1930s was pitcher dizzy dean he was so colorful a personality he was probably elected to the baseball hall of fame on the strength of that as opposed to his pitching statistics after all part of the dean story is that early end to his career in the pride of st louis dan dailey successfully captures the character of dizzy dean at least the dean i remember i m not old enough to remember him pitching but i do remember him broadcasting baseball game of the week during the 1960s for that s part of the dean story as well being a pioneer broadcaster on radio and later television now that announcers are in the hall of fame there s no question dizzy belongs there jerome herman dean was one of a tribe of sharecropper s kids who had very little schooling but an amazing talent for throwing a baseball at blinding speed in fact he had a younger brother paul dean who was a pretty good pitcher himself richard crenna plays paul in this film and it s one of his earliest film roles paul dean in real life was a quiet retiring sort who s career was also cut short by injuries because of that crenna isn t given much to work with during the dean heyday sportswriters tried to pin the nickname of daffy on paul but it never took joanne dru taking a break from playing western gals in gingham dresses and corsets is first rate as the wise patient and understanding patricia nash who met and married dizzy while he was playing for houston in the texas league in the 1937 all star game dizzy started for the national league facing cleveland s earl averill dean was hit on the foot by a line drive smack at him refusing to listen to medical advice dean came back to pitch too early he d broken a big toe and put too much of a strain on his arm he was never the same pitcher and his refusal to accept that is part of the story had he had a career of say ten to fifteen years who knows what pitching statistics he might have rolled up dean was the next to last pitcher to win 30 games in 1934 and after denny mclain who was something of a character himself did it 1968 it hasn t been done since dean went into broadcasting and while he was not the first former player to go into the broadcast booth his colorful game descriptions made him an instant hit he started broadcasting for the other st louis team the browns and the browns were a pretty miserable team with not much to cheer about dean became a star attraction there of course part of the dean story is the trouble he got into because of his lack of education and his colorful way of expressing himself on the air that s part of the story i won t go into but in the film it s handled with tact and humility and your eyes might moisten if you tend to the sentimental a fine baseball film a real tribute to an american success story,1
23748,from a bare description of the toll gate s major plot elements one might think it s a revisionist western of the 60s or 70s our hero is a robber killer and arsonist the love interest is a single mother whose shiftless husband abandoned her and their child twice our criminal hero is unofficially released by authorities in return for some good deed and this is presented as a praiseworthy act the only acts which are presented as truly evil are the betrayal of one s family and the betrayal of a criminal associate the hero tries to go straight but turns back to a life of crime after he can t get a job the hero is on the run from both a sheriff s posse and a criminal gang the hero s final redemption is accomplished by strangling a man with his bare hands and tossing his body over a cliff and the good bad man ends the film by sending the young mother and her child back to civilization and riding off alone into the mexican desert never presumably to pay for his life of crime just goes to show you that there is nothing new under the sun of course the toll gate doesn t display quite the cynicism or moral nihilism of its successors the hero s redemption is set up when he surrenders to the posse after reading a passage from the bible can t quite imagine clint eastwood doing that the toll gate an excellent movie by any standard and hart was a very fine actor not given to the broad histrionics often used to convey emotion in the days before sound 9 10,1
10589,seagal fans beware he does no action scenes until almost an hour into this mess instead seagal runs away from numerous fights letting ja rule convincingly lose every battle actually ja rule could be an up and coming action star but hollywood needs to let him at least hit puberty which should happen in a few more years also what sort of commando terrorist wears a bare midriff outfit the chick in this atrocity looks like a backup singer for christina aguilera back to seagal when he finally does cut loose it s his stunt double heavily padded to resemble the bloated seagal doing a lot of the work taking the falls i don t remember any aikido either it s just your standard kicks punches you d see in any straight to video martial arts turkey not even so bad it s funny either just plain dull,0
4612,if you like me enjoy films with plots and convincing actors then alien vs predator requiem is probably not the way to go in summary alien lands in typical american town predator lands in american town both have a bit of a fight us government blows up town some people get away i m sorry i think i might have spoilt the ending its easy to criticise someone who s being critical people cry out i bet you couldn t do any better i bet i could having made this film watched it and then turned to congratulate each other with a pat on the back and a job well done there must surely have been the spectre of lunacy in the room,0
11016,ok if you are a fan of mystery science theater 3000 and love to mock movies then you will have a lot of fun with this otherwise it may really be too painful to see plot obsessed cryptozoologist sneaks a huge crate containing a chupacabra onto a cruise ship apparently not having to declare it at customs or even mention that he s bringing aboard a live animal no really it s research equipment the air holes are just an accident some dipsticks he hired to lade it open the crate figuring he paid bunches of money maybe there s something to steal once the wood crate is open the chupacabra breaks through the steel bars inside and goes on a killing rampage yeah whatever by a stroke of sheer coincidence a marshall i assume a u s marshall since he was in the gulf war not just some guy named marshall is on board investigating some money that went missing from the ship s safe he s posing as an insurance salesman lady i m the best insurance you ve got other scintillating characters include the captain john rhys davies and sadly his dignity is the first victim of the film his tae bo instructor daughter snicker tae bo an annoying old stuck up lady with a tiny dog which should be fed to a cat guess what eats it and an incredibly unpleasant gigolo who might have been believable in a movie made in 1964 not in anything more recent much of the acting was really bad and the characters were just there so that you can laugh hysterically when they died overall screamingly bad bad on many levels bad bad bad what bullets don t even make chupacabra flinch but the tae bo bimbo can punch him and scare him away hey sci fi channel you desperate for scripts or what,0
1581,thanks to silly horror movies like troll and the indescribably atrocious cult favorite troll 2 it has become practically impossible to take movies with kobolds gnomes and various other types of little green hobgoblins seriously these days only just recently i watched the 70 s made for tv movie don t be afraid of the dark which is basically a quite terrifying and serious toned film about domestic little goblin monsters and yet i still couldn t help thinking back about the laugh inducing potato headed critters dressed in garbage bags that were running amok in troll 2 same thing happened to me now as much as i tried going into inhabited with a clear mindset unconsciously i kept comparing the supposedly creepy and menacing garden fairies with the badly sculptured goblins of nilbog still even without all the prejudices inhabited is a remotely entertaining albeit unmemorable straight to video horror flick it s a cheesy soft and politically correct pastiche of family drama and northern europe mythology the annoying and murderous little creatures in this movie aren t your plain average goblins they are the huldre wicked little norwegian demons that live underground and attempt to chase happy families out of their houses through influencing the youngest children this overcomes the russell family as they move into their ramshackle dream house in a remote little town the cherubic blond daughter of milf actress megan gallagher starts to behave strangely whenever she hangs out in the cute play house in the back of the garden she claims her friends are fairies and even though the sinister handyman also warns for strange occurrences in the past gina s parents simply think the girl has troubles adjusting to her new neighborhood when she keeps rattling about fairies they arrange an appointment with the acclaimed psychologist dr werner whilst the huldre are slowly coming out of their botanical shelter not much special to mention here the pace is acceptable and the attempts to build up suspense are pretty cute you understand this is a family friendly horror movie so no bloody murder sequences are graphically being shown here heck even the cadaver of the family s pet cat is kept off screen this is the umpteenth nonsensical horror movie in which malcolm mcdowell pops up and he practically always depicts an unreliable greedy and self centered authority figure,0
20876,while i agree completely with drvn below about mary mccormack flopping a milk bag out on tv the rest of the show is fantastic phil hartman was great in a professorly way teaching the celebs the ins and outs foley s a nut but in a good way you never know what self depricating humor he s going to come up with next as for the game play it s entertaining filled with witty banter and great for any newbie that may have even a passing an interest in the game too bad it isn t on anymore i just checked the schedule all the way to august and it doesn t appear to be scheduled for any time in the future bad bravo you deserve a beating,1
24887,for his last film john huston directed his daughter anjelica in this adaptation of the story from james joyce s dubliners and he gave us one of his finest achievements to remember him by joyce is about as impossible to film as anyone but the dead at least presents a traditional narrative to work with much indeed almost all of the important information in the story lies in the spaces between the lines in characters thoughts and expressions there are big moments but they re cerebral they re not the stuff of which movies are made but somehow huston gets it right and he manages a nearly flawless adaptation anjelica is magnificent and the movie is haunting and powerful grade a,1
17861,a terrific comedy drama about the powers of friendship despite it s a remake of a 1939 film of the same title it would probably be compared to sex and the city i would not compare to it totally the story starts with mary meg ryan who seems to the life most women would envy she s happily married has a good daughter great friends and a great home but marys perfect life isn t what it seems when she discovers her husband is cheating on her with crystal eve mendes from zach s mary is puzzled and doesn t know what to do but her four good friends sylvia annette bening edie debra messing and alex jada pickett smith try to be there for her in anyway they can i really don t want to give anymore away but i found this enjoyable and i m a man meg ryan is great it is nice to see her in on the screen again after a series of flops and the rest of the cast are also great including eve mendes as crystal just an enjoyable lighthearted comedy,1
10429,i disagree in calling this a stoner movie just because weed also makes an appearance i can t imagine this as even approaching stoner classic that would be like calling singles a grunge film the movie definitely plods along with a murky plot at times i wondered if the script had either been dropped and shuffled or if they lost it entirely and just tried to wing it watching this movie reminded me of watching children play acting and making the story up as they go along the characters are wooden the dialog is taxed and the whole story seems to be completely disconnected who got killed when what and this is how you act when your friend overdoses complete lack of emotion and utter disconnect from reality as for the droning guitar soundtrack that accompanies each scene enough it was like watching the opening menu screen where the same track loops endlessly in the background neither moving forward or back i kept watching and hoping that the plot would somehow fall in to order the acting and dialog would improve or something somehow would focus this mess in to a coherent movie after 112 minutes it never happened,0
814,italian rip off of mandingo and the drum is a badly dubbed italian life on the plantation yarn lots of people who don t look like they belong in the american south wear badly tailored costumes and wander around locations that look nothing like the american south the plot has something about the romance between a rich man and a certain young woman the jealousy that ensues and the tragedy that follows the film promises hot steamy sex and lots of twisted violence but nothing ever really comes of any of it its all tease its all probably racially insensitive i couldn t notice since its artistically bankrupt the final twist is at best laughable a major turkey,0
14831,i like this movie cause it has a good approach of buddhism for example the way buddhist use to care all kind of living things combining some fancy and real situations in some parts the photography is very good and a lot of messages about freedom as the hawk episode staying always focused in every moment even in tough situations it has also funny situations as swank s birthday and talking this two times academy awards her acting show us how the people who use to live in this kind of culture is trying to have a resistance behavior when miyagi is taking her to a buddhist temple and how she slowly is changing her mind and of course pat morita has been always great,1
16721,i saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it since then i ve searched for a video but never found it until now 33 years later when i ordered it from moviehunter sorry to say it doesn t hold up this glamourized version just can t rise up to the 1937 production level i love burt bacharach s musical score that is if listend to by itself and i even bought a cd of it but for my taste it doesn t lend itself well to this mysterious and compelling story just doesn t fit michael york is lost here sally kellerman tosses off a fine performance but olivia hussy is just ridiculous and not worth lugging through the himalayas the best performance is charles boyer as the head lama,1
9762,the book gets 10 out of 10 stars probably contains spoilers of both the book and the movie if you ve never read geoffrey household s rogue male the source material for man hunt you ll likely enjoy fritz lang s treatment of the story on the other hand if you re in my camp and have practically memorized the book the movie will be a crashing disappointment i ll assume you ve already read a synopsis of the story and proceed to my complaints household s little novel is one of the all time great suspense classics taut and spare with only a bare handful of characters to propel the action fritz lang and his screen writer dudley nichols feel the need to throw in the protagonist s brother and a sympathetic floozy the latter of which reduces the depth of the story by injecting an extrinsic motivation into the screenplay where the novel needed none in fact the true climax of the book was not the nameless narrator s escape from his underground lair but rather his self acceptance of his true motive for going on his hunt in the first place and that s another thing if david fincher and quentin tarantino can get us all the way through fight club and kill bill 1 without revealing the names of their respective protagonists why can t lang thorndyke what hat did they pull that out of which brings me to my bitterest complaint household s hunter is so quintessentially british he would bleed a union jack if you cut him but walter pigeon who plays him is canadian he can barely sustain the accent which is only slightly deeper and more convincing that kevin costner s in robin hood he looked about right in the role and was a fine actor for the 1940s but as rogue male s reluctant hero let s look to the sceptered isle itself for a more convincing version remake soon with subtlety and with please i ll direct it for free,0

18987,in 1850 in yorkshire a boy chimney sweep is falsely accused of theft by his crooked master and runs away he falls into a treacherous local river and is transported into an underwater realm where he makes many friends and rescues the mythical water babies from an evil shark based on a book by charles kingsley this is a lovely children s film half live action and half animation which is both a grim and evocative depiction of victorian times and a terrifically enjoyable undersea adventure it really is two films in one which somehow complement each other and combine into a much richer whole the animation by tony cuthbert jack stokes and miroslaw kijowicz is wonderful as is the photography by ted scaife and the music by phil coulter and bill martin pender has a great rough diamond quality as the literal fish out of water i love the moment when he s on top of the mansion sees all the chimneys and shouts blimey at the top of his voice mason and cribbins are the filthiest nastiest bullies you could hope to see in a costume drama if you want to see real victorian values don t watch sense and sensibility watch this and whitelaw pertwee who does umpteen voices and percival are all excellent this is how a good children s movie should be good old singalong fun but also just a little bit thoughtful sad and frightening high cockallorum,1
18266,this is one of the great movies of all time the story is fascinating and the actors are convincing your really identify with the characters william wyler proofs with this movie that he is a great director his craftsmanship is unsurpassed,1
16164,let s be fair there are no rules for scriptwriting so i won t say the movie should be something other than it is i ll just state my opinion ok i really liked the script the way things are told and characters are introduced however i think when a play is adapted to the silver screen it could maybe try and fit this other media since this movie was directed by jo o falc o the same man who directed the play it s not too much of a surprise that the film turned out a bit too theatrical it s the man s first movie for cryin out loud what i m saying is there are parts in the film like the city of nordestina which slightly resembles the set of hoje dia de maria that feel like we re not at a movie theater we re at the theater lines are spoken too formally characters are moving choreographically and the lightening is clearly meant for a stage sure maybe that was the intention but that s been done on stage wonderful things have been made when adapting a play into a movie the beautiful closer for instance when i went to see this one though i didn t feel like i was watching a movie but overall it was a good one worth watching it s a nice love story funny at times and sad at others my vote is a 7,1
20312,watching some of the sequences err the entire 1 3 of the film devoted to the battle on the ice in alexander nevsy a film directed by the russian legend sergei m eisenstein co directed by dmitri vasilyev in his only significant credit made me realize how much must really go into directing at least on a scale such as this if i were a member of an awards group at the time of this film s release i probably would award eisenstein with the director s award of the year posthumously it is such a mad stroke of cinematic genius to pull off some of things that are pulled off in the film though for someone like this director after coming off of his best work battleship potemkin and october it could have been something he scoffed at at first but amid a film that is sometimes a little frustrating with how little grays come in to the black and white subject matter it s still a marvel of celluloid almost 70 years later lord of the rings fans meet the films grandfather so to speak to say that something is a propaganda piece already puts a connotation to it and often a bad one it is something that has a full blown message to it and a point of view it s still a matter of hot debate see the swarms of argument over moore s films for proof about whether great art can come out of something that is point blank meant to rouse the audience in a specific manner in this particular case the russians against the germans at the time it was nearing ww2 and russia once again faced the german invaders and it s interesting to note that eisenstein was actually commissioned to make this film as a rallying call for the russians to never forget a crucial piece of their history the end result comes out as being something that is actually slightly common from seeing battleship and october however if nothing else comes through those films it s that eisenstein is most concerned about how the image and the content can come together finitely for the viewer that style can completely envelop the viewer without fail on those terms alexander nevsky is fearless but even with the whole idea of russia great germans bad there are some small moments where things are made a little less stringent a little less strict to these ideals for example when we first see the germans in privka they re not some faceless blob who are totally barbaric and have a blind conquering intent not that they aren t out to take whatever they can they have their own national pride going too that it would be nothing less for them to go forward with whatever their christian led masters tell them to at the least the evil of the picture has a face however kept at a low minimum for the more prevalent side to kick in there s also a brief scene before the ice scape battle where the russian troupe has a joke that s being told and laughed about and it adds a little extra depth where else there might be precious little because more often than not in alexander nevsky with its battle songs loaded with a pride in warfare there aren t any complexities to characters most notably nevsky himself played in ultra heroic fashion only questioning near the start by nikolai cherkasov who perhaps has to be this way in eistenstein s intention of having him as the one infallible force to be reckoned with in the tale after all to be looking for naturalism in an eisenstein film is like trying to find non kosher pig s feet at a deli but the real reason to see the picture isn t the acting anyhow but for the look of the film how it moves and takes in such an expansive environment that eisenstein lays out on the epic scale it s just as ambitious as his 20 s films with a number of extras not just in the main battle scenes but also in the scenes in the cities of the hundreds of people rolling on through in fact i d say that any director working in hollywood or elsewhere thinking of doing some kind of huge epic particularly war would do very well to take a look at this film even with just the sound off it s even better if thought of as a silent film with the visual strokes accentuated fantastically at times one could spend a whole month analyzing the battle on the ice how it starts with the german soldiers far away and then coming forward like bugs and then how eisenstein inter cuts between close ups of the actors fighting and then to wide shots and with sped up editing and of course one can t discount the power of the music as well sergei prokofiev delivering one of the great rousing scores of any epic work all the while the director s editing keeps our eyes moving along with this frantic action at breakneck speed if this was just a short film it would surely rank with the greats much like the odessa stairs sequence if i did find it a little less than totally magnificent it would be because of the faults that do come in from a director who is much more suited to the silent medium than for sound while i have yet to see ivan the terrible my one negative criticism would be of his direction of actors which is really as broad as can be with the melodrama at such a high pitch its staggering the sub plot of the two soldiers vying for the olga is the best example i can think of but even this considered alexander nevsky overall is too extraordinary to ignore and ratchets up an engagement in the action and the film making to a level that puts a benchmark for films even today to try and live up to grade a,1
924,i think downey was perhaps inspired by french new wave who wasn t unfortunately what he ended up creating here was more along the lines of crackhead new wave a synapse is obviously a terrible thing to lose and downey appears to have lost plenty just say no indeed in more ways than one including to watching this film i couldn t bear it after a while and began fast forwarding through it it would have been wiser to have just skipped it altogether,0
22714,excuse me helloooooooooo cuba gooding jr should have won an oscar for his portrayal in this film he was the film while the film may be lacking in some areas cuba was awesome and for me this is the best role that he has ever played the scene in the movie where he finds out that his mother has died made me break down and cry in the theater i guess i could really relate to this film because i saw the same treatment of people just like that at my own school growing up what a tragedy getting to see the real radio and coach at the end of the movie was really special too if you can watch this movie and not be moved to tears you need a heart check if you liked simon birch and the mighty you ll love radio too i wish they made more movies like this radio is the real deal,1
126,this is a pale imitation of officer and a gentleman there is no chemistry between kutcher and the unknown woman who plays his love interest the dialog is wooden the situations hackneyed it s too long and the climax is anti climactic i love the uscg its men and women are fearless and tough the action scenes are awesome but this movie doesn t do much for recruiting i fear the script is formulaic but confusing kutcher s character is trying to redeem himself for an accident that wasn t his fault costner s is raging against the dying of the light but why his conflict with his wife is about as deep as a mud puddle i saw this sneak preview for free and certainly felt i got my money s worth,0
7648,roger spottiswoode isn t the worst director and he did a good job on the underrated sci fi thriller the sixth day a k a the box office downfall of mr schwarzenegger however air america has to be one of his most inept projects it comes across as an amalgamation between drama comedy and war film it s not a very convincing mix in fact i found it to be overbearing robert downey jr during his heyday stars as a pilot recruited into a top secret cia organization operating during laos in the vietnam era mel gibson plays his co pilot and he stumbles upon the knowledge that they re trafficking drugs and what not the movie was hyped on release because it starred two famous faces and aerosmith had re recorded the doors classic love me two times for the soundtrack the redo of the song is pretty poor which suits the film,0

24326,the best romantic comedy i ve seen in years not the kind of slick over the top hollywood stuff by ben stiller or adam sandler and a lot less syrupy than a hugh grant epic julianne nicholson and jay mohr are perfectly cast and both deliver smoothly professional performances as the engaged couple who decide to spend a little time sowing their sexual oats before marriage instead of playing it strictly for laughs the writers and director concocted a nice blend of human feelings and comedic action nicholson is just great as the awkward seductress and mohr does a great job as the man who reluctantly enters into the game but soon finds himself enjoying his flings a little too much we see just enough of the supporting characters to nicely round out the plot without distracting from the main story andy richter earnest friend and helen slater distraught single mom are particularly good there is enough meaning and emotional complexity to make this a lot more than a standard boy girl farce indeed with just a little better pacing and a tiny bit more cutting this film would be a top ten comedy,1
22280,this movie was a heart felt piece of cinema that helped show the darker side of childhood and the little things that shaped who tom hank s was using a very cryptic story they were able to give you an idea of what truly happened to tom hank s character as a child and while scenes like the flying machine may have never happened it helped to show how even denial can help tell the truth in all good conscience i could not rate this lower then a 9 out of 10 great performances from all the actors and while many may not have understood the cryptic ending in which the brother is murdered by his step father and tom hanks covers it up using a far fetched story about a flying machine pay close attention to the little details such as the turtle that he still has even though his brother flew off with it truly a beautiful piece of cinema and every actor deserves recognition for it,1
5104,what is wrong with curacao also known as deadly currents though what the reasonn for the name change is i have no idea can probably be summed up where a woman says to her lover keep it down baby i m trying to sleep it s not the dialogue that s the problem or the way it s delivered it s the fact the actress has has a central european accent nothing wrong with that until it s revealed her character is from philidelphia in the united states this what struck me about this thriller while watching it the way accents don t match their characters apart from the philly woman with a german accent we see a south african with an english accent a local police chief who sounds like he s an irishman impersonating a gestapo officer and worst of all george c scott playing someone who s either dutch or british with an accent that sounds like it might be american tinged with south african you soon give up following what s on screen and end up concentrating on what nationality a character might be due to the strange way they speak it s interesting to note that this site hasn t given this movie a country of origin with so many different actors from different countries you do feel that this was produced by the united nations even if you re not curious about accents or dialects you ll probably have to give up following the action anyway because curacao is plot less things happen like a boat exploding and a hostage situation and the hero being recruited as an agent for south african intelligence but you re left scratching your head wondering what the heck this is all leading to i was lost,0
5029,frankly i m amazed to see that this movie is getting relatively good reviews i ll be completely honest and say that the only reason i even got through it is because of ryan phillippe and not for reasons particularly connected with his abilities as an actor though i think over the last years he has proved himself to be a better actor than his first major roles in the late 1990 s indicated as far as action suspense movies go this movie fails in nearly every respect the acting is ok i guess but the script is absolutely horrible and makes very little sense a fact which the filmmakers try to cover up by adding absurd references to chaos theory as if it would convince anyone that the film is actually clever but then again judging from other reviews some were don t be fooled the script is a boring derivative mess and no other element of the movie makes up for it wesley snipes has probably never had a less interesting role in a film and statham is a thoroughly dull actor not recommended,0
10167,movies about u f o s are always a nice way to kill some time so on a rainy sunday evening i picked up this flick expecting what can be expected from a direct to dvd u f o mystery boy was i wrong at about halfway in the movie it becomes very apparent that the u f o theme is just a deceptive way of attracting unsuspecting viewers to this christian propaganda and this is not just a christan movie from an average christian no this is christianity of the extremist fundamentalist kind the scary kind in the end of this movie the non believing lead is tricked by their colleagues using a practical joke in thinking that the rapture has started which is believed by christians to be the happening in the end of time where true believers are going to heaven and non believers are left behind when the joke is explained it is suggested that it is always better to become a true believer just in case we christians are right now that s a lamest excuse ever to become a christian if you ask me this movie still tries to convert non believers using scare tactics believe in god or you will go to hell is the message here simple but quite offensive really especially because this movie is being sold as something completely different now let s assume you re a christian fundamentalist yourself and you re not likely to be offended by the themes in this movie is this a good movie i m afraid it isn t no actually i m lying i m glad it isn t the acting is horrible the pacing is horrible the plot is horrible especially the ending is laughably bad as soon as the movie starts you immediately sense that this is going to be worse than you expected and you will be right in the first half hour it seems to at least attempt to set up a passable u f o mystery but then suddenly they bring in this count dracula look alike that starts babbling about the devil at first you just think this dude is just a crazy maniac but as it turns out he actually represents the real views of the makers of this movie as soon as you start realizing this you know how this is going to end up but actually it ends up worse avoid,0
17182,they don t make movies like this anymore though some may say that s a good thing although this was amongst the first of disney s pg rated films it has more of the feel of the g films their studio turned out in the 70s i e freaky friday the world s greatest athlete than the pg films that came out in the early 80s i e watcher in the woods tron something wicked this way comes because of disney s backing midnight madness obviously had a large budget a huge cast and a ton of diverse locations go to show that but zaniness a madcap scavenger hunt and spectacular visual style weren t enough to save the film from being an enormous flop a failure at the box office most of us were introduced to the film on hbo in the early 80s back in the days when the same films would be shown 29 times a week oh wait they still do that essentially hbo did for this film what cbs did for the wizard of oz they created an enormous cult audience for a sugary sweet mega flop the biggest problem that makes this a bad film is that there s too many characters and very few of them are fleshed out eddie deezen s squad don t even have names the blue team although they re the villains are the most endearing and have the most work put into their characters with the exception of the girl who can t act doesn t have enough to do harold perfectly played to the hilt by stephen furst is really the only one whose character is fully realized in the film the other standout character is goof off melio played with tons of charm by now director andy tennant although then dr pepper spokesman david naughton was supposed to be the star his character often comes off obnoxious particularly when pitted against his brother adam michael j fox while everyone has favorite characters i don t think anyone who loves the movie could disagree that furst and fox are the only two characters that you really learn anything about despite the film s many flaws and bad actors most of whom fell off the face of the earth after this movie it still works because the actors appeared to be having fun and fun on the set equals fun on the screen come on what college jock doesn t dream of floating around in a beer vat and what zoftig girl doesn t dream of stealing the show at the local discotech er i guess it would be at a rave nowadays campy squeaky clean fun for anyone who was young in the 70s 80s it s only fitting that this has finally gotten the massive video release that it deserves but where the hell s the widescreen dvd release with the commentary trailer and the full version of the song that plays in the disco,1
19155,i love aaron carter but even i expected pop star to be predictable but i was so wrong aaron carter was really funny in it and a great actor also the actress who played jane was a brilliant actress every one who i no who watched it loved it the music in it was also really good the my favourite lines from the film is you cant send me to a public school mom im a celebridee and take your time it l come to you although the endings kind of cheesy all the good chick flicks do this film is great and a proper good chick flick that i can watch over and over again,1
6295,first of all the title daily is a lie every daily show program opens with an on screen visual of the date it was made followed by a pause and the opening announce on the many days when they are re running a daily show they slip cue the tape and omit the date and begin with the opening announce giving the false impression that the show is a new one that s a lie there is no mention of it being a rebroadcast and that kind of crap is just a small indicator of how sneaky and deceptive this show is furthermore it s only on 4 nights a week that s not quite daily meaning monday through friday another shortcoming but one i am grateful for it s sad to think that many clueless young people use this fake news program as their main often only news source this leaves them woefully ignorant and much worse badly misinformed although it leans liberal left politically this show can be amusing at times however its veracity is low facts and information are often cleverly twisted to fit the writers agendas it s often hard to tell where the facts leave off and the fiction and comedy writing begin the result is pre digested reinterpreted information designed to persuade and influence this is called propaganda the remote interviews are heavily kluged in editing it really loses me when it bashes god and christians which it does all too often however you ll never hear anything vaguely anti semitic if jon stewart and company attacked anyone but christians it would be considered an offensive outrage the names in the credits explain the source,0
11150,barbershop 2 back in business wasn t as good as it s original but was just as funny the movie itself lacked little things which the original held which made it much more enjoyable back in business seemed to be just another worthless sequel made to bring in money with a very thin plot cedric the entertainer s terrible excuses for flashbacks ruined the movie and seemed to be a bad way to try and get the audience to adapt more with the character overall barbershop 2 back in business was a sequel not needed without the originals charm soul spark,0
11790,that this film has such a low imdb rating is not surprising in our post enron era do we really need any more reminders of america s obsession with the greed creed the topic has become so politically charged that a lot of viewers not only are not going to be entertained by movies of this sort but will respond with barely concealed rage it was all i could do to sit quietly through this cinematic memo of corporate corruption without extracting the dvd and smashing it into a thousand pieces what s really irksome with these kinds of films including purpose is their pretense that behind the glitter there s some meaningful message that makes the film worthwhile in purpose i found no such meaningful message what i did find was a story that idolized the materialistic trappings of capitalistic power and wealth the two main characters nauseating in their glibness do very little actual work instead they party they play golf they strut their coolness they sound hip with dialogue straight out of mtv culture speak rock my world and now get back to partying that s an order john is smug self important shallow and smirks a lot robert who wears funky little glasses is even worse the film includes two youthful garage geeks who look and sound like they re right out of the film antitrust 2001 stereotypes are played for all they re worth and in this film also include chic looking computer equipment and barbie doll chicks on hand for those occasions when our can do future billionaires need some relaxation after all that heavy duty partying and with the time bound images and dialogue that such a story necessitates can you imagine how dated this film will be in fifteen years about the best i can do for this waste of cinematic celluloid is to say that it does have some nice aerial views of san francisco the film would have been a lot more enjoyable a lot more entertaining if they had ditched those odious characters and that repulsive story and simply flown us viewers around in that little plane for the film s duration,0
24779,it s quite an accomplishment that three stories filmed by three very different filmmakers could be simultaneously so insightful about gay bi sexual relationships and their struggles pool days is about the awkwardness of adolescence and the mutual attraction between an older man and a younger one a story about experience and vulnerability a friend of dorothy portrays a common dilemma many gay and bi sexual people experience at some point in their life the intense attraction towards someone whom is heterosexual sensitively examined this story truly left me feeling moved the disco years shows another version of a no win situation getting involved with someone who is not only confused about their sexual orientation but is also terrified of being exposed as anything other than straight a very empowering story for those of us who have experienced betrayal at the hands of a sexually confused and frightened person while these three stories will appeal to anyone who has an iota of empathy towards others they will psychologically empower those who consider themselves gay bi sexual or searching each story is uplifting in its own unique way,1
14519,this film is so 1980 s and that is what i like so much about it it does an excellent job of conveying the feel of that odd decade the reality that russian nukes could wipe you out at any time reagan in the white house telling everybody that things were great while more and more social programs were slashed young people dropped out but not as far as their parents of the 1960 s did young people still went to school they just smoked so much dope that their sensetivities were all but dead nothing effected them not even the death of one of their classmates at the hands of one of their friends how weird is it to realize that the murder was wrong but you are not sure why watching the characters deal with the crime is fascinating and telling of a very sick society glover is great keanu is great hopper is incredible one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen,1
3385,the incomparable paul naschy horror film icon of spain lends his talents to this entertaining if not scattershot film what begins as an action flick ends up a horror story all i can say is just sit back and enjoy the ride paul naschy plays a cold hearted hit man hired by some shady japanese diamond hunters one of which is his flame who is carrying his child to swipe a cache of diamonds from a belgian businessman when the deed is done the allure of the diamonds is too tempting for paul to dismiss so he kills his japanese cohorts his girlfriend whose brother paul killed vows revenge and chases paul through the forest shooting him up and leaving him for dead however paul is found by an egghead with two horny daughters and brought to his estate to recuperate at the estate the two daughters silvia aguilar and azucena hernandez fight for paul in his weakened state with the busty silvia aguilar determined not to lose out to the sweet and prim azucena but things get hairy for mr naschy who begins to see the ghost of the daughter s long dead mother on the estate grounds couple this with the japanese lass looking to finish the job of killing paul and he gets pulled from two sides story the story goes a number of ways and doesn t fully satisfy the script builds up a fight for paul between the daughters but silvia whose character seems assertive and volatile simply lets azucena win in the paul naschy sweepstakes without putting up a fight personally i would have preferred the ghostly apparition story to the revenge seeking of the japanese woman violence you get gunplay a blown up babe and pigs eating some poor schmuck alive gore hounds will not be letdown with this naschy flick acting paul naschy as always is fun to watch but he does spend a bit too much time in bed recovering from his wounds starring with him again are the luscious silvia aguilar and the beautiful azucena hernandez who teamed with mr naschy in the little gem the craving both girls do a fine job nudity you get very brief glimpses of both aguilar and hernandez but they are strategically placed keeping the naught bits covered full nudity is supplied by the two lesser appealing actresses the japanese woman chasing paul and the african maid that works for silvia and azucena,0
8155,bela lugosi is a real enigma in the early 1930s he was on top of the world after appearing in dracula yet again and again he made lousy decisions regarding his career perhaps he had a bad agent perhaps his drinking and drug use had a part in it or maybe he was just crazy regardless he ruined his reputation by appearing in pretty much any film ranging from excellent horror films such as the raven to big budget flicks like ninotchka to grade z flicks for the cheapest and shoddiest of studios interestingly enough although he agreed to do this terrible film he actually turned down the role that later went to boris karloff in frankenstein as for this movie it is a very silly an horridly produced wwii propaganda film that featured a dumb plot and wretched editing lugosi spends much of the movie murdering saboteurs not a bad thing at all but at the end we find out that he is himself a nazi plastic surgeon and all the american looking men he killed were actually japanese the funniest part of this is during a flashback you see lugosi talking to a group of japanese men before he changes them to american like men when the camera scans them the men are clearly asian but on all the other non close up shots they are all very western looking many with bald heads they looked absolutely nothing like japanese men i suspect the plot must have undergone a re write and this might account for the obvious mistake or it could just be shoddy production values and editing in fact early in the film they show a street scene in the city and all the cars circa 1942 are old model t fords obviously from stock footage the bottom line is that the film is bad but also very dull unlike plan 9 from outer space it s hard to laugh at the ineptitude just be put to sleep by it,0
15556,the lone ranger tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three indians for what appears at first to be no apparent reason that is until the lone ranger discovers from a conversation with the indian chief tomache that each man possessed a medallion the five medallions given by tomache to his friends as gifts we later learn when combined will provide the mastermind behind the hooded raiders with a map to a legendary lost city of gold can the lone ranger protect the remaining two individuals in possession of the medallions before the hooded raiders get their hands on it is there really a lost city of gold somewhere upon native land watching this i kept knowing what was going to happen beforehand and everything seemed really familiar until eventually i realized i had seen this exact same movie when i was but a little kid suddenly the memories flooded back and i remembered having quite a fun time as a child enjoying this one with a bunch of my friends as an adult though the plot is somewhat predictable but you know this while not quite in the same league as the 1956 film remains a lot of fun to watch clayton moore is perfect as the lone ranger and jay silverwheels as tonto steals a lot of this movie as he s probably in more action scenes than even the lone ranger there s some very familiar faces on hand here including douglas kennedy as ross brady headman of the hooded raiders gang charles watts as a bigoted sheriff and ralph moody as a kindly padre,1
15624,i viewed the reader at sugar which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything and the movie was by far the highlight of the evening the technical elements were well meshed and it was obvious that duncan rogers had chosen his designers and crew well but it was the story and it s delivery that truly made this short shine duncan rogers tight script was just what this evening of shorts needed it neither meandered as several offerings did or preached to us the reader was simple story telling in it s best form well cast by rogers and beautifully acted duncan rogers is obviously a director with the ability to put all the pieces together i m looking forward to his next finished project k,1
846,i say this if you want to see art you go to an art gallery if you want to see a movie you go to a theater trying to intertwine art and film proves disastrous in where the heart is an interesting cast is totally wasted in this embarrassment you like dabney coleman see short time you like crispin glover see bartleby you like uma thurman see kill bill above all if you like christopher plummer see the silent partner because his character here is a terrible embarrassment in fact this entire production is an embarrassment sure the human artwork is intriguing for a few minutes so make a short but do not subject an audience to pointless nonsense masquerading as filmed entertainment merk,0
22055,though not a greek i have had a lifelong interest in the eastern empire its fall in 1453 was the greatest loss to christianity in its entire history yet while the easter empire is not a topic much discussed in american intellectual circles the us did not merely mimic golden byzantiums public architecture the us is much absorbed in the fated byzantine historical cycle and now has faced many of the crises involving certain people of a middle eastern extraction about whom it is said that there is a slight tendency for excessive exuberance on religious matters which humbled great byzantium i wonder if the loss of the ability to speak plainly was the first sign post on the road to disaster john romer is to be credited not only for his excellent production but also for his joyful enthusiasm for the subject which is most refreshing not recommended for americans who like political correctness,1
15308,the king of queens could be divided into two eras the first era constituted of the first few seasons portrayed the issues of everyday life of a man and his wife making it through life in the city paycheck by paycheck the second era increased the scope of the show addressing current popular culture and marital issues with a humorous spin but besides all of that this show was freaking hilarious kevin james when not doing crap comedy films with adam sandler is a genius of laughter and his chemistry with leah remini was unparalleled on tv jerry stiller as the psychotic live in father in law added his own unique style of quirky humor and patton oswalt as the man child spence ulchin was amazing he s a great comedian too the king of queens was the final sitcom of the 1990s to go off the air and it s a damn shame now all we have to watch are the idiotic sitcoms full of untalented actors and actresses whose only appeal is their physical appearance i like many fans of actually funny tv shows am now in a state of mourning,1
4186,if you make a suspense movie it is kind of important that the villain not be more sympathetic than the victim and this fails miserably it was so terrible and frustrating to watch that i was actually moved to register and comment ok so the husband is rich and cocky there are worse vices and the cabana boy and wife display plenty the husband is a jerk because he um didn t approve of the cabana boy physically assaulting that woman the witch one which had absolutely nothing to do with the plot btw the cabana boy threatens the husband and repeatedly attempts to seduce the wife he then forces himself on her which the woman finds so hot she stops thinking rape and starts thinking she wants him uh huh the misogynistic inferiority complex thoughts the director displays are just revolting it is one thing when a fine film like american psycho deliberately tries to get us to empathise with the villain but in survival island i felt like i was watching a movie about ted bundy but the director failed to make him unlikeable and instead made us hate his victims what was he thinking,0
17915,captivating tale of backstabbing behind the curtains the movie follows the plight of david letterman and jay leno as they struggle for the elusive tonight show spot letterman led by his desire for the coveted time slot and leno led by his agent and little devil on the shoulder helen kushnick kathy bates kushnick is excellent in this movie alienating herself from such top dogs as bob wright warren littlefield and howard stringer towards the end of the film you are so entranced with how she handles every situation from guest bookings to delayed taping that you find yourself wanting more john michael higgins letterman plays his part to the tee at times i found myself wondering if he was any relation to the real letterman i highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in entertainment or the world of corporate negotiations,1
12828,this movie changed the art of film making telling a complex story in a powerful new way the film mixes brutal realism with fantasy intercutting a modern war with strange scenes full of technicolour smoke the film uses music not as a score laid in later but as a practical part of the scene playing from speakers radios etc coppola uses a classic piece of literature as inspiration taking scenes and characters and putting them into entirely different surroundings that is a tricky and brave thing to do then he takes a superstar brando pays him a fortune and films him so that you can barely see his face the pure guts that such a move requires is astounding and it works beautifully this movie belongs in the top ten,1
4018,if you want to see how to ruin a film study this one very closely in fact it is so bad that people should buy it for that reason alone especially note how most of the scenes look as if they were knocked up in about 5 minutes realism escapes this movie on every level the overall impression is that someone was given a below average script wannabe actors an average director and absolutely no budget whatsoever with a formula like that it just had to be doomed i rented this once and i swear i got stupider watching it if you are a humanitarian buy this horrible horrible movie and burn it unwatched as a favor to the world it has no discernible plot bad acting and then tosses in something about evil ugly women just to really cap the whole thing off i would suggest watching paint dry before this stupid waste of a tape seriously the paint would be better i wish i could give this negative 10 stars,0
6833,i remember seeing this film when i was about 10 one of my friends had it at the time it was just a film as i was about 10ish and just thought of it as another action film when i look back now as a complete film buff this is quite a shockingly bad film whoever produced this film i am sure had a short hollywood career although the lead actor seems to have done a few films according to imdb albeit i haven t seen any and don t really remember him too much anyway just to say that this film is really bad in all ways it could be i would love to see it again though od,0

21879,sherlock holmes basil rathbone begins this story in disguise helping to smuggle famous physicist dr franz tobel william post out of switzeralnad and under the watchful eye of the nazis who want his bomb sight plans the allies obviously want it too and sherlock is there to help dr tobel has invented an instrument which greatly aids in the accuracy of aerial bombardment holmes and dr tobel arrive safely back at baker street but the scientist would rather be alone for some mysterious reason although he had promised the english to help them not the germans he stays true to that promise but there are some desperate moments for holmes and the english along the way it s an entertaining film and one in which our famous detective uses not one but three different disguises he needs all the help he can get when he goes up against his arch rival professor moriarity one complaint if moriarity was that evil he would have dispensed with holmes without batting an eyelash instead of giving him openings to escape it s pretty sad too when the usual dim witted dr watson nigel bruce has to rescue his boss from certain death a couple of times yes there are some credibility issues in this story but if you can put your brain on hold a few times it s a fun film to watch and it looks beautiful thanks to the great restoration job done on this dvd it makes the old print come alive with some wonderful visuals particularly the night time shots one other note whoever did the english subtitles in here misspelled or misinterpreted at least a half dozen words it s very sloppy work and not the first time i ve encountered this watching the entire series on the restored dvd set,1
18500,i saw this film when it first came out and have never forgotten it my uncle antoine is much much greater than the sum of it s parts the movie loosely is about a pre adolescent who is sent to live with a relative in a small town in canada there are adventures that seem more or less typical but underneath there is a current building mua has a leisurely pace but have patience the reward is coming i believe the film was sub titled and as with all non english speaking movies i ve seen it is well worth avoiding any dubbed version inevitably dubbed movies reflect the attitudes of a new director and actors with the additional necessity of lip synching lines that don t quite fit the english speaking amarcord is a travesty for example while the sub titled version sings my uncle antoine is well worth the time to find and watch it in french,1
17301,this movie is a fascinating example of luis bunuel s storytelling abilities this is a comedy that is not a comedy and a social drama that is not a social drama even though i don t think it was particularly funny it made me laugh also despite the fact that you can never take bunuel too seriously the movie made think about religion and its importance in some people s lives bunuel tells the story of a catholic priest devoted to his faith like no one else and the viewer witness what happens when the priest s undying commitment to serve others is put to test as usual bunuel s target is catholicism but i don t think he tried to mock the church as he often does at least i didn t take the film as a mockery of the institution i think he is trying to make an interesting point about how religion could be a nuisance in today s modern society not because faith in itself is bad but because people always mange to bastardize the concept message aside i think this is one of bunuel s most clever works francisco rabal is superb as the priest definitely one of the filmmaker s best movies,1
1531,i went to see this movie mostly because it looked so good in the trailers robin williams and barry levinson should equal greatness instead it just continues williams bad streak of movies lately what s wrong with the movie more like what s right the ensemble crew does a pretty good job around robin and like usual christopher walken is fantastic that being said this movie just plain wasn t good i really only recommend seeing it if you want to see what it would be like if jon stewart ran for president and won saying he won isn t a spoiler since it was in the trailer the concept and idea is really amusing but that s all most of robin s jokes are just recycled from old comedy bits of his and there are very few laugh out loud moments and most are just dumb like most comedies that turn out to suck all of the funny bits are put into the trailer really no surprises there but come on some of the movie reads like a tom clancy or vince flynn novel people were expecting this to be robin s return to greatness instead it s more a flubber,0
11938,this film started off really tense when a poor young boy is set upon by a pack of savage dogs after a tense chase he is saved by said grandpa with magic whip we are then introduced to a string of annoying house mates including one tart who is always half dressed during this stage the film heightens tension with strange plinky plinky background noises that had me on the edge of my seat i stopped paying attention for a while but when i looked back on the screen there where weird creature type things going around grunting and killing one word of advice if you are ever trapped in your home by some nutter get some cardboard boxes and a tray although we did skip half the film because it was totally non interesting or memorable we are now at the stunning conclusion the last surviving creature thing fights a whip duel with grandpa and his magic whip i wont say what happens here but i can say the whip battle is full of tension with aerial fights split level fights and all manner of drama i am now going to shove this film through the door of a neighbour i don t like,0
24143,serendipity i thought i was off to a bad start bringing home the wrong dvd in the case of the intruder rental stores staff so i did not want to see this film but i am glad i did in all probablility my chosen movie would not have been as superb a slice film as this delectable and delicate taste of what independants in both us and europe can do together seven years apart two heroine sisters embark on fantastic journeys through early 1970 s post student demo baader meinhof europe sumptuously shot in the algarve portugal and in berlin paris and amsterdam reminiscent of the feel of the exterior shots in paul verhoeven s early masterpiece the fourth man it s touchingly acted by brewster diaz and especially christopher ecclestone the story unveils itself along an abstracted plot capturing the ephemeral emotions of these characters as they confront their relationships and see idealised images of each other and themselves shattered a movie with great refinement and taste not for arnie commando fans which is probably why the reviewer upstairs is so wide of the mark in his claims that this is a girly film daft criteria wrong too well worth experimenting with,1
7513,slow odd film that drags and plods i mean really plods along to its disappointing climax you may expect some sort of punchline at the end but there is none both milland and snodgress give awkward performances in fact the film s weirdness may actually be the only thing it has going for it the generally atmospheric score has some absurd parts like the music that plays during the first appearance of a monkey and there is a truly awful fantasy scene involving a gorilla,0
19321,near wonderful mixture of comedy romance and medical chaos has a 50 ish swinging single doctor tired of going to rock concerts with nubile airheads dating a patient his own age whom he met on his rounds screenplay by julius epstein shows a fair amount of sophistication though he doesn t have enough material to fill out the picture s last third and one can almost feel the movie slipping the subplot about the hospital being investigated for its shoddy business affairs isn t worked out satisfactorily and it feels highly concocted anyway still walter matthau and glenda jackson are a terrific team richard benjamin and art carney very funny in support director howard zieff keeps it all popping and even when epstein s one liners feel like neil simon rejects zieff zips right along happily the results are dryly engaging and occasionally quite sweet followed by a failed tv series from,1
3510,hi y all i bought this on dvd from england you see i have one of those multi region players i thought it would be fun to get a cool movie to show to my friends well surprise to amy jo johnson she s barely in the movie although she is on the cover it s really difficult to imagine how a film this bad got made in the first place perhaps someone has a trust fund oh it s about vampires who live at the beach,0
24217,crackerjack is a simple but feelgood movie where the good guys are very good and the bad guys are very bad and the central character is tempted by both sides the combination of the central character being played by mick malloy and the central setting being the local lawn bowls clubs drew an unusually broad crowd ranging from large numbers of teenagers to large numbers of senior citizens and all laughed at the comedy as would be expected of a movie with mick malloy and judith lucy there was quite a bit of swearing but it was not overdone and the audience i sat with certainly enjoyed it mick malloy did a good job as the lazy bloke who joined the bowls club three times simply to get parking spaces one for himself and two for leasing to others at a premium but who has everything fall down on him when he is required to play or lose his membership judith lucy does a fine job as his local journalist love interest and there are fabulous performances from bill hunter frank wilson monica maughan lois ramsey and many others john clarke s dour role as the bad guy is not one of his funniest but he gives a solid performance the not so subtle swipes at pokies provide a bit of a serious note to this otherwise light comedy i m sure that those who enjoyed the castle and the dish would also enjoy this movie,1
14679,this particular title is very interesting the whole movie was like watching a ninja rpg which is really cool three magical swords three clans a horrible demon a political power yotoden has it all the animation is decent but a little grainy the story is top notch and the fight scenes are real cool one thing that really looks good in this movie are the monsters they are pretty freaky if you liked blood reign and ninja scroll yotoden is the one to see,1
13649,just as a reminder to anyone just now reading the comments on this excellent bbc mini series published in 1981 it was not available on dvd until the last few years since then it has become available but initially only in the british format for which i bought an international dvd player which you have to hack illegally i suspect to see it but the series is now available through amazon com 3 discs for between 19 21 to be viewed on dvd in the us format no hacking there were 41 reviews average 5 stars this mini series is one of the very best on oppenheimer or the manhattan project or virtually anything produced by the bbc,1
2141,the greek locale for parts of the movie were very beautiful and the photography get all my votes and that s about the extent of my raves for this movie i found that all the characters were narcissistic archetypes found so often in the american culture and were shallow and uninteresting susan sarandon and gena rowlands are easy to look at but i found their characters very narcissistic and unlikeable for many other reasons when gena rowlands sings at a party it made me wonder how this woman could think of herself as a competent star of the stage i was tempted to hit the mute button until she finished singing molly ringwald was herself and raul julia s character was so lecherous he was downright creepy the movie was much too long for my liking and i could not sit through it again even at the point of a gun,0
24330,i happened into the den this morning during the scene where ed was engaged in the 3 way and thought my wife was catching up on some early morning porn much to my surprise it grabbed my attention and i rewound it and we started watching it at 4 30 in the morning what a very entertaining rich funny and well developed plot line and script we both thoroughly enjoyed it my wife so much that she shared the experience with her girlfriends at work going on to recommend it and say what a kick she got out of it i am in my late 40 s and she in her early 50 s i think this movie would have appeal to both young and old an unexpected very enjoyable surprise nice work thanks two thumbs up,1
21132,there s a sign on the lost highway that says major spoilers ahead but you already knew that didn t you since there s a great deal of people that apparently did not get the point of this movie i d like to contribute my interpretation of why the plot makes perfect sense as others have pointed out one single viewing of this movie is not sufficient if you have the dvd of md you can cheat by looking at david lynch s top 10 hints to unlocking md but only upon second or third viewing please first of all mulholland drive is downright brilliant a masterpiece this is the kind of movie that refuse to leave your head not often are the comments on the dvds very accurate but vogue s it gets inside your head and stays there really hit the mark david lynch deserves praise for creating a movie that not only has a beautifully stylish look to it cinematography wise has great acting esp naomi watts a haunting soundtrack by badalamenti and a very dream like quality to it but on top of it all it also manages to involve the viewer in such a way that few movies have before after all when is the last time you saw a movie that just wouldn t leave your mind and that everyone felt compelled to talk and write about regardless of whether they liked it or hated it allright enough about all that it s time to justify those statements most people that have gone through some effort to try to piece the plot together will have come to the conclusion that the first half of the picture is an illusion a dream sequence of course that s too bad for all those trying to make sense of the movie by expecting traditional methods in which the story is laid out in a timely logic and linear manner for the viewer but for those expecting that i urge you to check the name of the director and come back again md is the story of the sad demise of diane selwyn a wannabe actor who is hopelessly in love with another actor camilla rowles due to diane s lack of talent she is constantly struggling to advance her career and feels she failed to deliver on her own and her parents expectations upon realizing that camilla will never be hers c becomes engaged with adam kesher the director she hires a hitman to get rid of her and subsequently has to deal with the guilt that it produces the movie first starts off with what may seem as a strange opening for this kind of thriller which is some 50s dance jitterbug contest in which we can see the main character betty giving a great performance we also see an elderly couple which we will see twice more throughout the movie together with her and applauding her no wait this is what most people see the first time they view it there s actually another very significant fact that is given before the credits the camera moving into an object although blurry and the scene quickly fading out if you look closely the object is actually a pillow revealing that what follows is a dream the main characters seen in the first half of the movie betty diane selwyn s imaginary self used in the first half of the movie that constitutes the dream sequence a positive portrayal of a successful aspiring young actor the complete opposite of diane betty was chosen as the name as that is the real name of the waitress at winkies notice that in the dream version the waitresses name is diane rita the fantasy version of camilla rhodes that through diane s dream and with the help of an imaginary car accident is turned into an amnesiac this makes her vulnerable and dependent on diane s love she is then conveniently placed in betty diane s aunt s luxurious home which betty has been allowed to stay in coco in real life adam s mother in the dream part the woman in charge of the apartment complex that betty stays in she s mainly a strong authority figure as can be witnessed in both parts of the film adam the director we know from the second half that he gets engaged with camilla his sole purpose for being in the first half of the movie is only to serve as a punching bag for betty diane since she develops such hatred towards him aunt ruth diane s real aunt but instead of being out of town she is actually dead diane inherited the money left by her aunt and used that to pay for camilla s murder mr roach a typical lynchian character not real appears only in diane s dream sequence he s a mysterious influential person that controls the chain of events in the dream from his wheelchair he serves much of the same function as the backwards talking dwarf which he also plays in twin peaks the hitman the person that murders camilla this character is basically the same in both parts of the movie although rendered in a slightly more goofy fashion in the dream sequence more on that below now having established the various versions of the characters in the movie we can begin to delve into the plot of course i will not go into every little detail neither will i lay it out chronologically but i will try to explain some of the important scenes in relation to lynch hint sheet as i mentioned above camilla was re produced as an amnesiac through her improbable survival of a car accident in the first 10 minutes of the movie which left her completely vulnerable what i found very intriguing with md is that lynch constantly gives hints on what is real and what isn t i ve already mentioned the camera moving into the pillow but notice how there s two cars riding in each lane approaching the limo only one of the cars actually hit the limo what about the other even if they stayed clear of the accident themselves wouldn t they try to help the others or at least call for help my theory is that since this is a dream the presence of the other car is just set aside and forgotten about since as rogert ebert so eloquently puts it like real dreams it does not explain does not complete its sequences lingers over what it finds fascinating dismisses unpromising plotlines shortly after rita crawls down from the crash site at mulholland dr and makes her way down the hillside and sneaks into aunt ruth s apartment betty arrives and we see this creepy old couple driving away staring ghoulishly at each other and grinning at themselves and the camera this is the first indication that what we re seeing is a nightmare although the old couple seem to be unfamiliar to betty i think they re actually her parents since they were applauding her at the jitterbug contest perhaps she didn t know them all that well and didn t really have as good a relationship with them as she wanted so the couple is shown as very pleasant and helpful to her in the dream they also represent her feelings of guilt from the murder and diane s sense of unfulfillment regarding her unachieved goals in her life a rather long and hilarious scene is the one involving the hitman diane apparently sees him as the major force behind the campaign trying to pressure the director to accept camilla s part in the movie from adam s party in the second half of the movie and he therefore occupies a major part of her dream because of her feelings of guilt and remorse towards the murder of camilla a part of her wants him to miss so she turns him into a dumb criminal this scene i think is also lynch s attempt at totally screwing his audience over since they re given a false pretence in which to view the movie gotta love that something just bit me bad line though the next interesting scene is the one with the two persons at twinkies who are having a conversation about how one of them keep having this recurring nightmare involving a man which is seen by him through a wall outside of the diner that they re sitting in after a little talk they head outside and keep walking toward the corner of a fence accompanied of course by excellent music matching the mood of the scene when reaching the corner a bum like character with a disfigured face appears out from behind the corner scaring the living crap out of the man having the nightmare this nightmare exists only in diane s mind she saw that guy in the diner when paying for the murder so in short her obessions translate into that poor guy s nightmares the bum also signifies diane s evil side as can be witnessed later in the movie the cowboy constitutes along with the dwarf one of the strange characters that are always present in the lynchian landscape diane only saw him for a short while at adam s party but just like our own dreams can award insignificant persons that we hardly know a major part in our dreams so can he be awarded an important part in her dream we are also given further clues during his scenes that what we re seeing is not real his sudden disappearance etc the cowboy is also used as a tool to mock the director when he meets up with him at the odd location the lights here give a clear indication that this is part of a dream also notice how he says that he will appear one more time if he adam does good or two more times if he does bad throughout the movie he appears two more times indicating to diane that she did bad he is also the one to wake her up to reality that scene is probably an illusion made to fit into her requirements of him appearing twice and shortly thereafter she commits suicide the espresso scene with the castigliane brothers where we can see badalamenti the composer as luigi is probably a result of the fact that diane was having an espresso just before camilla and adam made their announcement at adam s party in the second half it could at the same time also be a statement from lynch during the scene in which they enter diane s apartment the body lying in the bed is camilla but notice how she s assumed diane s sleeping position diane is seeing herself in her own dream but the face is not hers although it had the same wounds on the face as diane would have after shooting herself this scene is also filled with some genuine lynchian creepiness since diane did not know where or when the hitman would get to camilla and finish her off she just put her into her own home in real life diane s audition for the movie part was bad in her dream she delivers a perfect audition leaving the whole crew ecstatic about her performance also interesting is the fact that the money that in real life was used to pay for camilla s murder now appears in rita camilla s purse this is part of diane s undoing of her terrible act by effectively being given the money back as the murder now hasn t taken place when her neighbor arrives to get her piano shaped ashtray another hint is given she takes the ashtray from her table and leaves yet later when camilla and betty have their encounter on the couch we see the ashtray appear again when the camera pans over the table suggesting that betty s encounter with the neighbor was a fantasy the catch phrase of the movie adam is auditioning actresses for is she is the girl which are the exact same words that diane uses when giving the hitman camilla s photo resume the blue box and the key represent the major turning point in the movie and is where the true identities of the characters are revealed there s much symbolism going on here the box may represent diane s future it s empty or it may be a sort of a pandora s box the hitman laughs when she asks him what the key will open either way it is connected to the murder by means of the blue key which is placed next to her after the murder has taken place the box is also seen at the end of the movie in the hands of the disfigured bum club silencio is a neat little addition to further remind the viewer that what s he is viewing is not real it also signifies that diane is about to wake up to her reality her reality being a nightmare that she is unable to escape from even in her dreams during the chilling scene at the end where the creepy old couple reappear diane is tormented in such a way that she sees suicide as the only way out in order to escape the screams and to avoid being haunted by her fears anyway that is my 0 02 hope this could help people from bashing out at this movie and calling it the worst movie ever or something to that effect without realizing the plot as usual lynch is all about creating irrational fears and he certainly achieves that with this picture as well 10 out of 10,1

412,dolemite is the touching story of dolemite gotta love blaxploitation film titles an ex con who probably should still be in jail he gets in trouble with cops friends drug dealers women prostitutes and society in general he s just not that likable a guy neither is the movie though it s still hilarious and worth watching the flimsy premise is that dolemite played with as much enthusiasm as star rudy ray moore can muster is in jail for a crime he claims he didn t commit when a drug hit or a drug bust or drug something is about to go down the warden releases him to stop it or help it or just watch it not very clear all i know is that i was unaware that the justice system frees convicts in order to allow them to prove their own innocence my ignorance i guess the plot is convoluted and unimportant basically dolemite goes around killing people usually with very poorly choreographed karate having sex and cursing out people sometimes even rhyming too the joys of the movie are its total incompetence and its total indifference in the matter i stopped counting the number of times i saw the boom mike after it was in one scene for the entire duration about two minutes of film i stopped questioning why the warden was looking down at where dolemite was sitting even after he stood up and walked around when they cut back to the establishing shot and dolemite was inexplicably sitting down again i stopped wondering why dolemite dressed like that when he got naked on the street to change because he didn t want to get in his car with the ugly read normal clothes the jail gave him and i stopped wondering where he learned karate when he jiggles his hand on a guy s stomach and somehow cuts him open the only time i was ever remotely nervous and tense was when the disgusting flabby white mayor is walking around totally naked with nothing but a towel hanging around his neck which just barely covers him up you keep saying cut away cut away cut away but by the time they do you are already emotionally scarred the movie is ridiculous in every way imaginable moore as dolemite is either funny cool or both if you re on the lookout for a bad movie you have found it with dolemite,0

14516,a teenage film about angst friendship loyalty and growing up but this isn t a happy outing on its part due to the circumstances and life changing dilemmas surrounding the premise what eventuates is quite numbing haunting and downright cold however i was expecting something a little more powerful and effective and while engrossing and unforgettable it didn t entirely stir up much in the way of emotions the performances are reasonably a mixed bag but there s a brutal honesty to them all dennis hopper and especially daniel roebuck are amazing crispin glover eccentrically over does it and keanu reeves dead as wood turn seems to pay off in his custom slacker role joshua john millar is quite good and so is ione skye jim metzler chimes in with a short but highly engaging performance the story is dramatically confronting character laced and harrowing in its eventual breakdown where it infuses a gritty and painful punch j rgen knieper s swirling music score is simmering with anxiety tension and wonder as the morals and commitments are tested and learnt,1

1184,i rented this movie hoping that it would provide some good entertainment and some cool poker knowledge or stories what i got was a documentary type look at an average guys life who happened to be really good at cards do i want to see the romance with his wife no do i want to see about everything that went on in this guy s life except poker no well thats what you get with this film the acting is good for such a low budget piece of crap the film never tries to break the mold or do anything original it simply sleep walks its way through the script the ending is disappointing and never really looks deep into ungar s mind instead it focuses on what was already obvious he was a drugged out card player with an average life not unlike any other average joe in vegas the movie focuses on the aspects of his life that were un extraordinary rather than the extraordinary the poker scenes in the entire film add up to about 4 minutes of footage ungar s achievements of winning the wsop 3 times seem life after thoughts a 10 year old could do a better job directing this movie or maybe it was the script being a piece of crap from the beginning that doomed this joke of a movie if you want to see a film about gambling watch rounders it at least has style,0
22482,one has to be careful whom one tells about watching 12 hour long films it could become easy for people to assume that this is some kind of regular occurrence in fact even in the world of arthouse cinema such mammoth running times are extremely rare for obvious reasons this is one thing that hollywood and art cinema share in common the generally accepted running time of 90 120 minutes with a minority of movies that dare to approach but rarely exceed the three hour mark for this reason a film like out 1 runtime 729 minutes is a challenge for even the most hardened cinephile and it goes some way in explaining why it has only ever been screened on a handful of occasions and remains extremely hard to find originally devised as a tv series by maverick nouvelle vague director jacques rivette it raised little interest from the french networks and wound up being given a brief theatrical run instead peter watkins was forced to do much the same with his brilliant nuclear war pseudo documentary the war game although that had more to do with state censorship than issues with running time shown a couple of times in 1971 out 1 has re emerged at a handful of rivette retrospectives over the last two decades and many who have seen it including esteemed us critic jonathan rosenbaum have acclaimed it as one of the greatest films of all time is it well yes if you like rivette that alone is a big if as jacques rivette has never been a commercially successful director only two of his films were hits celine and julie go boating 1974 and la belle noiseuse 1991 both superb and many remain difficult to find on dvd today out 1 only recently became available over the internet after a rare videotape was uploaded nevertheless he is greatly respected within the film community and with good reason his playfully surreal narratives sense of pacing and use of improvisation set him apart as one of cinema s most unique and satisfying film makers out 1 deals with a theme that re occurs throughout rivette s work the nature of acting particularly in the context of theatre and improvisation his fascination with acting make rivette s films a far more collaborative process than many of his contemporaries as the improvisational aspects allow actors to have a far more active role in determining how the film comes together out 1 is roughly divided into four major narratives gradually intertwining and blurring as the film develops two consisting of acting troupes each trying to devise post modern theatrical adaptations of aeschylus plays the other two individual petty thieves played by nouvelle vague icons jean pierre l aud and juliet berto pursuing eccentric methods of making money and an overarching plot involving a mysterious balzac inspired conspiracy centred around an organisation known as the thirteen as with any rivette film featuring a conspiracy narrative the mysteries and secret organisations are little more than a red herring as the characters are slowly explored and revealed and their plans and interpersonal connections break down the film becomes increasingly symbolic of post 1968 ennui and the decline of the ideals of that era for a film made in 1971 these were remarkably prescient themes another french director in jean eustache would tackle this topic equally satisfyingly in his 1973 masterpiece the mother and the whore but this is not the limit of out 1 s scope comprised of eight episodes of roughly 90 minutes each the beginning of each episode has a brief abstract black and white still montage of the events of the previous chapter out 1 is no less watchable than any quality tv series and may even be better experienced on a one episode at a time basis this is not to say that it doesn t remain challenging even when viewed in segments like most rivette films it uses the first few hours to simply establish the characters before embarking on the plot of sorts and some of those early scenes particularly the sequences depicting the actors heavily abstracted exercises seem interminably long these scenes are important however not just as an exploration of the improvisational acting methods that play both a literal and a metaphorical role in the film but as a method of adjusting the viewer to the somewhat languorous pace of the film paradoxically long takes make long films far more tolerable for an audience and this understanding of pacing has led rivette along with more modern directors like michael haneke and b la tarr to create films with less commercial running times that nevertheless retain the capacity to leave viewers enthralled in a film that is in many ways about acting the acting is fantastic many famous nouvelle vague faces appear including the aforementioned l aud and berto the outstanding michel lonsdale and rivette regular bulle ogier even another legendary director in eric rohmer has a great cameo as a balzac professor who appears in a pivotal scene the people and architecture of paris c 1971 though seem to have an equally significant role the city landscapes crowd scenes and interested onlookers freeze out 1 in time a document of a place at a point in history after a little more than 720 minutes the film ends on an impossibly brief enigmatic note yet the exhausting journey that the viewer has taken is so full of possibilities intricacy and spontaneity that one would be forgiven for wanting to start all over again from the beginning or see the next twelve hours in the lives of these characters for those who have watched many kinds of cinema and think they have seen everything the art form has to offer out 1 is a reminder that cinema has the potential to be so many more things and diverge in so many more directions than current conventions allow for film makers film critics and artists of all disciplines this is something to be cherished,1
17952,the big snit came into my life complete by accident and has left an indelible mark on my soul a scar of love destruction and pointlessness that will forever be a part of my life this is tale of beautiful futility we are helpless without each other we are helpless against governmental wrong doings we are helpless as to the choices we all try to make when in love deaf to the mutterings and goings on of an world outside the window blind to an inevitable apocalypse dumb of the hatred and greedy opinions of an over indulgent society this is a tale of personal commitment and triumphant love defeating the ideologies of war their petty bickering is a sublime observation of human nature and of how love comes with it s pains and darkness everyone has some irritating aspect to their personality and this is observed by the makers in the most simplistic and fantastic way we travel only a short distance with the two main characters but are left wanting to complete our own journeys with a some of their simple loving honest philosophy in tow i am so very glad that i exist in this our time another 20 years either side of my birth date and i would not have seen and felt the big snit william white sheffield,1
2869,i ve been on a bad run of films this is a clinker about an arson plot and a psychopath tom skerrit whom i really enjoy was pretty young here he is a builder with a passion but he has a partner whose profit motive includes over insuring and burning into the mix comes an agent who is drowned his daughter and her nut case boyfriend james mason plays the insurance investigator any idiot given a little warning would know something was rotten in the nation of australia still they bumble their way the most interesting thing to me was that the huge hotel that was going to be built never got beyond being a bunch of sticks low budget i guess the plot could have been interesting maybe they should have hired a film editor the did half the time you don t know where the characters are but i guarantee a five million dollar payoff would have probably made a close watch on the structure mandatory it doesn t work although there is lots of neat fire,0
14061,this is one of the best episodes from the entire x files series creepy beyond words the tension and suspense in this episode is very well executed in its entire 45 minutes it managed to be almost as scary as an entire movie this episode joins the ranks of best episodes with such greats as home humbug bad blood and milagro for being the best in their respective season mulder and scully s growing relationship is put to the test in this episode can they really trust each other this episode also contains a tiny scene that will leave romantic viewers smiling mulder bring your mittens,1
20867,this miniseries is a reasonable sequel to the original gone with the wind if one views this on its own merit and not immediately following the original it comes out pretty good i am sure that most viewers will question the performances of scarlett and rhett but it seems unlikely that anyone else could have done better many of the characters here are new to this storyline so comparison in those cases rhett s mother uncle henry hamilton will benteen is not a problem no one will every be vivien leigh or clark gable the best part of the whole production is the beautiful scenery of springtime charleston and ireland watch it for that alone obviously this was a high budget tv miniseries it follows the book for a while then has a totally new plot when scarlett goes to ireland the acting is credible if nothing special kind of the way i feel about roger moore following sean connery for james bond,1
13678,while my kids enjoyed the movie and announced afterward that they want to buy it later i think i got more out of it that they did the scene in the airport shop at the beginning is real life i did not use the cutting comment aloud but i thought it it is a feel good mid life movie a bit sappy and some scenes work less well than others why does the kid stay with bruce willis after he knows his mom is dying but all in all and good time it also gave our family something to talk about did my kids think my life was boring what do they expect at 40 how can you not like a movie that gets a good conversation going with your kids,1

17427,tiny toons is the first cartoon i remember watching as a child and i loved every minute of it when i was four or five my parents purchased the video how i spent my vacation i watched it over and over again until i new every word well a few days ago my three year old cousin came over and i had to entertain him i decided to show him this old relic of my childhood i new he would laugh but i was surprised how much i laughed like every tiny toons film and episode the humor is based more on wackiness and slapstick humor and succeeds tremendously bugs babs plucky duck maton pig and fifi all endure amazing adventures from bugs and babs white water rafting with a little help from superman plucky duck and maton pig travel to the greatest amusement park only to ride the monorail and elmyra goes on an odd quest to find cute kittens in a safari land some of the classic humor stands in this tiny toon adventure and is some of the best wacky comedy i ve ever seen my favorite gag had to be the monorail thing when hamton and plucky arrive ride the monorail and leave much to plucky s dismay no matter what your age you ll laugh yourself to tears while not having to deal with language and nudity tiny toons adventures how i spent my vacation starring the voices of charles adler tress macneille joe alaskey and don messick 5 out of 5 stars,1
15017,the most amazing film i have ever seen i didn t read the programming and i just stumbled onto the movie by accident i thought it was a real documentary and i felt sick at what i saw i only found out it was a movie after it was finished and i looked on the web for more info about punishment park in the u s it felt incredibly real and it is easy to believe that this really has happened in the us if you are from europe i must admit that i felt really anti american after watching the movie and before finding out that it didn t really happen that way,1
137,2 3 of this movie is recycled footage of the previous movies a fact that s sadly obvious even to someone like myself who hasn t seen the original movies and somehow it feels like a rip off even though i haven t seen the stuff before it s like that episode of every tv show where the characters sit around a photo album or something and you just see recycled footage of other episodes i ve seen some producers do extended montages of recycled footage but never anything beyond 5 minutes or so this movie is mostly stuff that had already been seen by audiences so you could mount a case that it s one of the biggest rip offs ever foisted on the motion picture public i got to see it in the theater in a 16mm print which is good enough i suppose considering how rare this kind of material must be on film these days i give the movie some credit for semi convincing gothic atmosphere and for unintentional humor but that s about it the aztec mummy monster looks good even has some mobility in his face which is better than most movie monsters of the period but the robot is pitiful although it s interesting that they made the human face totally visible it s a robot human or something of the sort as they somewhat explain in the movie i think that s considered an android so technically in hard sci fi terms this movie should be called android vs the aztec mummy but i doubt anyone was too worried about technicalities here anymore than they were worried about quality in fact the movie is so sloppily put together that it makes television look good even the dubbing from mexican into english is lazy and weak for example at one point the hero says i might as well begin at the beginning what the heck kind of translation is that couldn t they at least have him say start at the beginning so that it doesn t sound repetitive a high school newspaper editor could have fixed the screenplay of this movie it s the epitome of utilitarian film making just absolutely nothing is in this movie that doesn t need to be there for the basic commercial purpose of the film they put no more effort into making it than they had to and considering the extensive recycled footage i would doubt that they actually spent more than a week making this movie i will now cease posting about it on the principle that i don t want to expend more energy in the process of commenting than the creators of the movie actually expended while making it,0
11915,and nothing else one of my friends bought the problem child tantrum pack contains the first two problem child s in one disc and we decided to watch the sequel because it was funnier there were many funny moments in the movie the vomit scene that s all i need to say nippy the dog after eating chow down and numerous others the movie is nothing but toilet humor but it s hilarious other than the funny moments though this movie has little to offer john ritter annoys the crap out of me because it sounds like he s reading out of a book the man can t act in this one sorry although i can t say if i would find the movie funny now we were blown when we watched it it s a perfect movie for a rainy day but nothing else don t expect oscar material on this one guys,0
5600,the gun is probably the worst film i ve ever saw the comedians direction is very poor the dialogs sounds like they were written by a 13 year old teenager the plot what plot is another suspense in which it is very hard to get into finally nothing in this movie is any good a big thumbs down to everyone involved and particularly to the montreal film festival who presented this movie in competition,0
7687,almost certainly staged montage of women reading lines very briefly and getting naked not very briefly in front of a anonymous and uncredited panel almost certainly including producer charles band thrown in are random scenes of surrender cinema s many movies primarily lesbian scenes most of the women like riding horses hmmm there is a polish woman who seems to have no interest in acting despite going to an audition a secret camera that films actresses getting naked behind the screen jacqueline lovell too made up but still beautiful introduces a couple of her own movie scenes and talks in a sexy way to the camera if you enjoy lesbian scenes the one with lovell and vanesa taylor from femalian is included and they are probably the best looking lesbian couple ever weird excuse for a movie and aside from the obvious draw of naked women a frankly dull and uninspiring experience,0
8175,major spoilers watchable only for the action sequences not the story or acting in it nature unleashed fire has one of the longest and excruciating endings in modern motion picture history we have the fearless ranger jake bryan genesse leading this trio of hysterical bikers to safety in of all paces an explosive fume beaching mine shaft this during a raging forest fire it seems that ranger jake with all his knowledge of the great outdoors didn t realize that a mine shaft that s leaking with dangerous and explosive methane gas is the last place to go when all the woods around it is on fire spoilers from this point on all this started some time ago when ranger jake in an effort to save the not that on the ball miner tiny chris harz aka the sherd let him slip through his fingers and fall to his death at the bottom of the mine shaft or did he even though we were kept in suspense to who s setting the forest fires for the first half of the movie it wasn t a surprise at all the tiny was the culprit as you would expect in movies like these tiny seemed to be made of hardened steel in that nothing that ever happened to him fires explosions as well as impaling could stop the crazed miner before tiny s reappearance or resurrection ranger jake got involved in rescuing bikers chris mel sharon marcus josh cohen melanie lewis anastasia griffith ross mccall who were trapped in the woods with fires breaking all around them having the usual know it all marcus among the bikers things don t go as smoothly as ranger jake wanted them to go marcus not only eggs on the meek chris to do something stupid jump with his bike over a 10 foot pile of logs but has the guy break his leg this makes it almost impossible for ranger jake to have chris air lifted out before the fires consume him as well as his fellow bikers for the remainder of the movie ranger jake who put himself in charge makes boner after boner in his attempt to save himself and the trapped and lost in the woods bikers all this ends with jake s brilliant idea to hide in a dangerous and abandoned mine shaft with the rescue party just yards away from rescuing them if they only stayed put and in the open where the rescue team could find them even though he was supposed to be the life of the party or movie tiny for all his efforts in being another indestructible super villain came across as a man who spent too much time out in the sun the make up job on tiny was so outrageous that he looked like he dumped a jar of spaghetti sauce over his head instead of having it burned to a crisp ranger jake came across as either somewhat very naive or retarded in his being so taken in by the dangerous tiny in always trying to save the rampaging psycho who never hid his feelings about what he had in mind for the play by the rules forest ranger in fact ranger jake actually encouraged tiny to do both him and the bikers in by showing him how incompetent he was in trying to save them the fact that ranger jake was successful wasn t because he was so smart but because tiny despite his indestructibility was so brainless,0
13559,this is a great family film dealing with down to earth people who enjoy their local interests dealing mainly with horse racing lloyd bourdelle walter matthau is a farmer who also raises quarter horses and has a young son named casey bourdelle who loves horses lloyd is able to raise a full grown horse who he calls casey s shadow after his son and this horse breaks all speed records and is a possible winner of a million dollar race sarah blue alexis smith becomes interested in this horse and offers to buy the horse for 500 00 dollars however this horse receives serious injuries to his legs and lloyd receives a serious set back which upsets the entire family walter matthau gave an outstanding performance and this is a great film to view and enjoy,1
6892,what were they thinking when they made this truly terrible film arbus one of the most important photographers and women of the twentieth century had a fascinating and dramatic life what possessed anyone to make this film which explains her unique artistic vision as being the result of an imaginary affair with a grotesque yet charismatic hairy freak played by downey in real life arbus broke out of a traditional marriage and woman s role to express herself in this movie arbus is an ultra dreary nicole kidman whose inspiration is all attributed to a beauty and the beast devotion to an interesting man for this reinvention the film is truly shameful independent of that it is also just dopey and dull,0
7984,i rented this because i couldn t pass up the chance to see pre hollywood fame clive owen and catherine zeta jones together but it definitely wasn t worth it the only reason i give it two stars instead of one is for the novelty of seeing them before they made it big across the pond zeta jones who is usually fun to watch even if she isn t the greatest thesp in the world is awful owen seems really uncomfortable to be in such a turkey plus he wears a ridiculous egregiously ill fitting chin length wig at least i hope that s a wig and not his real hair and the scene where he dances a country jig with zeta jones just makes you embarrassed for him joan plowright walks around in a daze the whole movie she s probably wondering how she got herself into such a mess the actress who plays clive owen s wife isn t terrible but just about everyone else is oh and the writing stinks too,0
117,years ago when darling lili played on tv it was always the pan and scan version which i hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format so when i saw an inexpensive dvd of this julie andrews blake edwards opus i decided to purchase and watch it once and for all boy what a terrible film it s so bad and on so many levels that i really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong looking at it now it s obvious to any fans of movies that blake edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with andrews in musicals mary poppins sound of music thoroughly modern millie etc but also because andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by julie herself camelot my fair lady etc because hollywood thought she wasn t sexy or glamorous enough so blake created this stillborn effort to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story war movie romance slapstick comedy musical darling lili suffers from multiple personalities never knowing who or what it is some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole it just doesn t work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing mind you the version on the dvd is the director s cut or in this case let s salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop in releasing the dvd edwards cut 19 scenes 19 from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version the film moves along with no idea of what it is we are 25 minutes into it and we still don t know what s going on or why we re watching what s going what kind of spy is lili how powerful is she was she ever responsible for someone s death instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking rock hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking julie andrews things aren t helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love why does julie fall for hudson why him and not other men she got involved with there should have been one of her ex hanging around trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret this would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action it would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings there s no catalyst in this story one only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by andrews and edwards previous successes the best or worst example is the scene when andrews and hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest edwards channeling sound of music it s no wonder he removed it from the dvd back in 1970 that scene might have worked on a certain level but today that moment reeks of desperation there are other plot elements directly inspired by andrews edwards other films the endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better modern millie the musical moment i ll give you three guesses was created just to make fun of julie s mary poppins persona which is turned raunchy with julie doing a striptease in the act the ending bird s eye view of julie running towards hudson s plane is another wink at sound of music the whole thing is confusing julie plays a singer born from a german father and british mother who lives in england but sings her english songs in paris you never know exactly where the story takes place some moments are just badly edited like when julie and her uncle are on horseback they talk and talk and then julie suddenly sprints off in mid sentence i m like what happened here the comedy bits are unfunny and cringe worthy every scene with the french police are pathetic where s peter sellers when you really need him the action is stupid beyond belief when julie and her uncle are on their way to germany on that train hudson s squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train almost killing lili in the process brilliant what s also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning that s one slow moving train there the musical moments the beginning is the best part of the entire film and the reason i gave this film 3 stars but it s effect is diminished considerably because it s repeated at the end speaking of redundant did we really need to see a can can dance crepe suzette stripping scene and julie stripping too the girl in no man s land is ok even if it s bleeding obvious but that moment just doesn t make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a french hospital making me wonder how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying the whole project is listless and without energy the romance is 100 unbelievable rock hudson is way too old and tired looking check out the museum scene julie looks dazed like she s on valium but what really kills this ill conceived project is julie playing a german spy edwards desperately wanted to dispel the mary poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision as much as i like julie she s no greta garbo who pulled it off so beautifully in mata hari funny enough even if julie plays a german spy she still comes across as cloying and cute how bad is darling lili even after 37 years since its release blake edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its dvd release,0
17369,one type of western i greatly enjoy is when the apparently weak which is reluctant to fight and answer the challenge of the strong finally decides there is no other way there is a great moment in this film when john parrish glenn ford goes into the saloon and decides to stand up to the gunfighter wade matlock it is the type of scene that makes the audience applaud in my opinion the violent men is a great western i would rank it among the best it makes great use of the wide screen a spectacular scenery of the mountains the women have a crucial part caroline may winn is engaged to parrish but you feel that she is only using him as a means of getting out of there and moving east she wants him to sell the ranch no matter what price martha barbara stanwick is tired of helping her crippled husband lee edward g robinson but she will do anything to have an always bigger ranch and more power meanwhile she is betraying her husband with his brother brian keith her daughter judith diane foster is seeing all that happens but feeling impotent to react because she does not want to hurt her father parrish unites all the small farmers and uses the strategy he learned in the army to go against the anchor ranch like he had warned lee don t make me fight because you won t like my way of fighting,1
23912,some people drift through life moving from one thing or one person to the next without batting an eye others latch on to a cause another person or a principle and remain adamant committed to whatever it is and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it but we re all different made of different clay as one of the characters in this film puts it which is what makes life so interesting some people are just plain crazy though and maybe that s the way you have to be to live among the masses who knows who knows what it takes to make things life work writer director lisa krueger takes a shot at it using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed and how one gets committed and obsession in committed starring heather graham as a young woman who is adamant committed obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy too her name is joline and this is her story admittedly joline has always been a committed person in work relationships in life in general she s a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what and when she marries carl luke wilson it s forever the only problem is someone forgot to tell carl and 597 days into the marriage he s gone off to find himself and figure it all out when joline realizes he s not coming back she refuses to give up on him or their marriage maybe it s because of that clay she s made of regardless she leaves their home in new york city and sets off to find him which she does in el paso texas of all places but once she knows where he is she keeps her distance giving him his space and not even letting him know she s there she considers carl as being in a spiritual coma and it s her job to keep a spiritual vigil over him until he comes to his senses and while she watches and waits her life is anything but dull as she encounters a young woman named carmen patricia velazquez a waitress at one of the local eateries carmen s grampy alfonso arau who is something of a mystic t bo mark ruffalo a truck driver who has issues concerning carl and neil goran visnjic an artist who makes pinatas and takes a fancy to her for joline it s a journey of discovery during which she learns a lot about carl but even more about herself there s a touch of humor a touch of romance and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot and krueger presents it all extremely well delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining her characters are very real people with all the wants needs and imperfections that make up the human condition a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story we see it from joline s point of view as krueger makes us privy to joline s thoughts and therefore her motivations which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold that along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates makes for a very effective piece of storytelling there s an underlying seriousness to this subject matter but krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy handed or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that joline encounters and the result is a well textured affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life heather graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make joline a character totally of her own creation she immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person and one that is real and for this film to work it was imperative that joline be viable and believable and graham succeeds on all fronts her screen presence has never been more alluring and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes is enough to draw you in entirely it s all a part of the character she creates there s an appeal to joline that exudes from her entire countenance who she is inside and out she s a likable agreeable person and because you ve shared her innermost thoughts you know who she is it s a good job all the way around beginning with the way the character was written to the way graham brings her so vibrantly to life as carmen patricia velazquez is totally engaging as well her performance is very natural and straightforward and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character she has a charismatic presence but is less than flamboyant and it gives her an aspect that is attractively down to earth she is refreshingly open and up front you get the impression that carmen is not one to hold anything back but is totally honest on all fronts and that too is part of her appeal and as with joline this character is well written and velazquez brings her convincingly to life overall there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film including those of luke wilson casey affleck as joline s brother jay goran visnjic alfonso arau and especially mark ruffalo as t bo who with very little actual screen time manages to create a memorable character the supporting cast includes kim dickens jenny clea du vall mimi summer phoenix meg art alexakis new york car thief dylan baker carl s editor and mary kay place psychiatrist a film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider the big picture reflecting upon who we are where we re going and what we really need committed is an enjoyable experience a ride definitely worth taking 8 10,1
3147,spoilers oh sure it s based on moby dick totally obsessed and it destroy s him it s a total folly the movie starts off rather well but by the end of the film everyone else is destroyed and the main star s mind is a blank the supposed half sister is never convincing some very poor lighting effects music is interesting but little else it took me over a month to finally finish the darn thing i suppose if you like being john malkovich you might like this but where as bjm was a great movie that i just didn t want to watch again pola x is a movie i just hate to high hell the only possible excitement in the film is the gratuatious incest sexual scene towards the end of the film hopefully yer not thinking of catherine either this movie is severely boring depressing and poorly directed not highly recommended if if you like french movies go watch crimson rivers instead 4 10quality 5 10 entertainment 1 10 replayable 0 10,0
13111,i was laying in bed flicking through the channels and boy do i have channels 500 of them with over 70 movie channels i probably watch a movie on cable once or twice a month dvd has spolied me anyway i m flicking through and i come to this movie and because i see natilie portman i take interest 110 minutes later i am still interested how could this be when i first saw the previews to this movie in the theater i remember making fun of it i never thought i d watch it nevermind like it the story is based on a book and you can tell the movie is very episodic andit s not like the movie has a great plot it just sucks you in may be its that performances that do it i m pretty sure in must have been this movie was good for no reason peter s movie rating out of 10 7,1
21247,alfred hitchcock s saboteur is not one of his best regarded films made between two vastly more popular and critically praised pictures suspicion and shadow of a doubt it s generally regarded as a lesser effort i agree that the later film is groundbreaking drawing hitchcock wholly into the american mainstream for the first time but saboteur is in its way at least as lively as suspicion its chief flaw being its less than charismatic star players bob cummings and priscilla lane in saboteur we find hitchcock feeling his way around america literally as its lead character travels from california to new york in search of an arsonist for whose crime he was accused cummings is very youthful here and quite engaging his boyishness but not immaturity perfectly suits the character he is portraying and seems appropriate as the director though middle aged was in the process of reinventing himself and an older more established star might have thrown things off priscilla lane s spunky heroine which not a typical type for the director was very much a common type in american films at the time and she and cummings provide an openness and a youth the director needed both in his life and work at this time i cannot imagine older more solid types cooper and stanwyck for instance doing any better as they would have between them carried well too much baggage as is the norm in hitchcock s films nothing is as it appears where saboteur differs from his better known films is that the audience is let in on the game early though cummings is an accused arsonist we know that he is innocent the villains become apparent fairly soon and the movie hinges more on its plot than its ironies what pleasures there are are incidental and here the master does not disappoint there is an interesting tod browningish interlude with some circus freaks who help cummings elude capture in another scene reminiscent of james whale s bride of frankenstein cummings spends some time in the cottage of a blind man who as it turns out is lane s uncle was the director perhaps studying key american films of the previous decade whatever the case these and other offbeat and discursive aspects of the movie give it a playfulness and variety which when one adds the factor of quite youthful leads makes the picture seem like the work of a younger man still learning his craft the film s later scenes in new york are more suspenseful and typical of the director as the picture gradually becomes more hitchockian as it moves along in the end i find it a satisfying work and as neither cummings nor lane has a dark side as an actor neither does the movie have one it is deliberately lightweight and i suspect semi experimental an attempt by hitchcock to see if he could pull off in an american setting the sort of story he had done so well in england he succeeded admirably the next logical step shadow of a doubt a film in which the main character travels east to west and with a wholly different set of values and plans,1
20220,this movie had reminded me of watching the old black and white movies with my dad more true to life characters looking for love being in love and loosing it old story fresh view larenz tate was so cary grant in style as the character may have been in a clumsey situation but the actor kept him from looking silly and like a cardboard cut out nia long has always been a favorite of mine she is sweet even when she is tough almost like a kathrine hepburn this is one of his best work and showing that he is better than always playing an angry black manthis movie is a classic superb acting well written a real love story set in chicago what more can you ask for superb black love story,1
1045,i watched this movie last night and let me say it s the absolute worst thing i have ever seen the entire film is a train wreck and it s not the actors it is the horrible script spoilers alright eddie loses his job to a monkey his nerdy son is disappointed the bathroom goes crazy he gets a free vacation he goes along with uncle nick and the original audry their boats crashes they stay on an island they are stupid and don t even bother to look at the nearby hotel ok so that s that what makes this movie pathetic is the humor it is so horrid hillybillyish and stupid you can t even laugh and it s not stupid funny humor either i couldn t laugh the entire thing,0
13718,wrestlemania 6 is an entertaining wrestlemania if not an entirely successful one the ultimate challenge is of course worth the price of admission alone but once again as with a lot of the early mania s there s too much filler in between the crowd pops for almost everything and as always giving us the reliable announcing team of gorilla the body having a face vs face match as the main event for a wrestlemania was absolutely unheard of at this time it only made things that much more tense matches koko b ware w frankie vs the model rick martel for a 3 or so minute match this is as good as it gets i wish it was a tad longer but what i got was pretty damn good martel wins with the boston crab 2 1 2 5wwf tag team championship demolition vs colossal connection c w bobby heean huge pop for demolition match itself is pretty dull i often had trouble paying attention andre really didn t do much so in a way it was more like a 2 on 1 there is solid talent involved here and it s a shame they couldn t produce better demolition wins that titles with there pattened maneuver off the top crowd blows the roof of for the finish 1 1 2 5earthquake w jimmy hart vs hercules i got what i expected here a standard boring filler match with earthquake doing his thing i m not really a fan of either so it didn t perk my interest much quake wins with his sit down splash 1 5brutus beefcake vs mr

beefcake wins with a slingshot to the post much to the crowd s approval 3 5roddy piper vs bad news brown huge pop for piper nothing more than a boring brawl that does not know what it wants to be some entertaining antics from the hot rod but nothing else noteworthy for roddy painting himself half black and calling himself hot scott 1 5the hart foundation vs the bolsheviks record breaking but other than that nothing to see here harts win with the hart attack 0 5the barbarian w bobby heenan vs tito santana average for the time it got but watchable nonetheless crowd was rather dead for it except for heenan s interference jessie s hilarious cracks about tito s food is more entertaining then the match itself barbarian wins with a nasty looking flying clothesline off the top 2 5mixed tag match dusty sapphire w elizabeth vs macho king sherri big pop for dusty and an even bigger one for elizabeth who looks absolutely stunning might i add i thought it was ok it was lively at least if nothing that great i m not a fan of dusty so dusty and sapphire win when she rolls up sherri 2 5the orient express w fuji vs the rockers crowd is rather anemic for this surprisingly decent no doubt but with these guys involved it should have been better the constant focus with fuji kinda detracts from the match express wins by count out when janetty gets nailed with salt 2 1 2 5jim duggan vs dino bravo w earthquake jimmy hart duggan like an idiot brings out the american flag in canada duggan gets some solid boo s for it too but that also may be due to bravo s canadian heritage crappy match all around i don t care for duggan but that s not why it sucked too short in the end to really matter duggan wins when he whacks bravo in the back with the two by four duggan gets splashed for his troubles 0 5million dollar championship ted dibiase c w virgil vs jake robers w damien some slow spots but when all was said and done i had a good time two solid wrestlers giving it there all resulted in an entertaining match up crowd noticeably gets ancy during parts of it though by doing the wave dibiase wins by count out jake has the last laugh by giving away some of his money much to the crowd s delight 3 5big bossman vs akeem w slick nice pop for the bossman too routine and too short to really mean anything in the end akeem was a gimmick i was never too fond of bossman wins with his slam 0 5the rhythm blues segment was pretty much a failure crowd wasn t into itrick rude w bobby heenan vs jimmy snuka for a filler match before the main event this wasn t too bad if it had time to get going more it would have been excellent for sure rude wins with the rude awakening 2 5title for title ultimate warrior ic champ vs hulk hogan wwf champ this one is all about the atmosphere from the crowd and the split crowd reaction for the most part warrior got a pretty decent pop but in my opinion it was a little underwhelming hogan dwarfs it completely with his it s one of wrestlemania s best matches in history with two people who aren t really known for there wrestling they managed to create an amazing match up that was talked about for ages i have seen this many times and my respect level grows higher for each one for their effort considering i m not a fan of either even die hard fanatics who crave pure wrestling can t bitch about this one warrior wins with his splash 5 5bottom line wrestlemania 6 is an entertaining entry if nothing overly special it s memorable for the main event the location and the crowd but it s not one of the best if you ask me that being said i do enjoy it and i give it my recommendation to fellow wrestling fans 7 10,1
8226,six months after high school sprinter laura dies during a race a killer begins to murder the rest of the track team using a variety of sports equipment as weapons that s the daft plot of early 80s slasher graduation day a lacklustre addition to the genre that offers very little in the way of style originality or decent gore what it does deliver however are some stunningly awful musical interludes a few familiar faces including an early appearance from scream queen linnea quigley and a smattering of nudity a prerequisite of any slasher movie so forget the death scenes they re lame and rather bloodless and instead enjoy the movie s more memorably crap elements the rapid editing that can induce migraines and epileptic seizures the roller disco which is accompanied by a prolonged heavy rock song gangster rock as performed by the unforgettably awful felony an impromptu jamming session by the school s students christopher george hamming it up as chief red herring coach michaels and the cheesy music teacher who letches after his female students who for some reason find him quite irresistible towards the end of the film the action picks up a little with the discovery of the slaughtered kids bodies under the bleachers and a quite twisted scene featuring laura s corpse in her cap and gown but it all comes way to late in the day to save this film from mediocrity,0
5949,this film has got so much in it prehistoric society adventure romance true brotherhood violence sex religion all depicted abundantly without a single word uttered and how come it sucks so bad this film will make you rethink the origin of humanity if this were the product of anthropology you would rather defy darwinian theory and hegelian synthesis all together you cannot bear to watch this even with your brain shut down and now you are thinking i ve got to see this i warned you i take no responsibility whatsoever should you regret spending over an hour staring at this piece of art well i did warn you this should be forgotten and buried for ever,0
24380,so glad i have hbo right now i didn t plan on watching a movie today but when i got home and saw that the next movie on hbo was this one i decided based on the description to at least give it a shot i m so glad i decided to watch this movie maybe this movie just caught me at a vulnerable moment i m a little stressed out got a huge test to be studying for but it definitely gave me quite the perspective on friendship not to mention taught me a valuable lesson on empathy i m currently one year away from graduating from pharmacy school and the whole scene involving the doctor and the nurse was definitely a learning point for me anyhow i just wanted to post up letting the world know this is an amazing movie and not to be missed there is definitely something for everyone in this movie,1
13686,i waited long to watch this movie also because i like bruce willis the plot was quite different from what i had expected but still quite good its a good mix of emotions humor and drama left me thinking over and again,1
7400,roomies is the story of a guy who loses everything except his incredible girlfriend and an idea for a corn dog that he plans to patent and sell immediately his uncle dies and leaves him a house and a car and he gets some roommates in to help pay the rent and gets a job then his girlfriend gets drunk and cheats on him so he goes and writes a book about roommates and becomes famous 88 minutes none of these details of the plot are explored in any detail what you read above is more or less as interesting as the film will be when his uncle dies there are some breasts on screen one of the potential roommates he interviews is pretty funny for about 40 seconds the ending is literally the worst i ve ever seen i want the other 87 minutes of my life back i hadn t thought anyone could make a movie with so little merit surely there are rules against this sort of thing getting to the public the script can t be longer than twenty pages and the budget must have been minuscule because the whole film has about 3 locations and a car the only conceivable use for roomies in my opinion is if you re holding someone hostage and want to frustrate them beyond human thought if so get it on repeat and you ll have a ready made gibbering wreck within the day one and a half out of 10,0
569,lou costello sans abbott plays a small town self employed rubbish collector and the inventor of a time controlling machine who is secretly courting the niece of the town big shot after a spat lou s girl dorothy provine runs into a misty cave why it s misty we never learn and emerges as a 30 foot giant provine is certainly a good sport and she doesn t bother trying not to look ridiculous it would ve been impossible anyway yet the screenwriter is really cruel to this character turning her not only into a giant but a nagging harpy as well provine bosses costello around while creating havoc with the army troops who get called in but nothing funny is done with the transformation trumped by attack of the 50 ft woman the previous year the film does feature lou costello in his final bow but provides little else the special effects are marginal while the script needed funnier lines and the direction snappier pacing 1 2 from,0
15403,betty sizemore renee zellweger lives her life through soap opera a reason to love as a way to escape her slob husband and dull life after a shocking incident involving two hit men morgan freeman and chris rock betty goes into shock and travels to la believing that she is destined to marry the show s main character greg kinnear nurse betty is that rare thing a lesser known film with an all star cast and a fluffy rom com plot that surprises with it s terrific script and spot on acting indeed such a plot makes one question the r rating but it s warranted all right the shocking incident that sends betty over the edge is a tad too graphic compared to the light amusing comedy that is to come and feels like something out of a different movie but at the same time it is necessary to believably show betty s transformation into the doe eyed lovable nut job she becomes as we go along with betty on her journey director neil labute works some extraordinary magic which makes the movie unique and high above your bog standard comedy of error an example of this would be betty s first meeting with her crush she pours her heart out to him and he plays along thinking she s auditioning for a part on the show even as we are aware of the ludicrous nature of betty s ramblings the music swells as she speaks giving us the audience betty s emotional perspective we almost believe what she is saying yet we understand that her mind is fractured whereas other filmmakers would try to accent the ridiculousness of the situation to wring every ounce of possible comedy out of the scene labute is sensitive to his main character and treats her with the utmost sympathy and understanding the banter between the hit men played by freeman and rock is priceless the excellent script doling out clever line after clever line for them to riff off of freeman in particular is excellent as always pacing himself as his character slowly and blindly falls in love with his own ideal of betty not even truly knowing who she is or what has happened to her aaron eckhart once again shows versatility in the thankless role of betty s no good husband and he is almost unrecognisable the other revelation here is kinnear whose portrayal of the soap s star is not too overcooked there s a tendency to lay on the celebrity bastard clich as thickly as possible and kinnear resists instead imbuing him with a pompous yet restrained self importance despite simply being a soap star the soap opera is realised so well it could almost exist labute and co hit the nail on the head with this one and a good thing too if the soap opera had been too satirical a large part of the film would not have worked to do a days of our lives spoof as seen in friends would have been the wrong move for this movie the dedication to detail pays off as the style and feel of the soap opera begins to bleed into betty s reality more and more while keeping with the overall unintentionally comedic aspect of the genre the scenes on the set feel real as opposed to some films in which the atmosphere feels so manufactured you wondered why people who do it for a living can t get it right the neat resolution of the final act while being a tad predictable is wholly satisfying overall it s a shame that after labute directed this wonderful film the mainstream came calling for him to direct the abysmal remake of the wicker man a fine example of a man so totally above the material given to him unfortunately one cannot absolve him of all responsibility if you haven t seen nurse betty it s something to discover if you have it s worth a re visit there is a charm to nurse betty that is infectious even if it may not leave you thinking that much afterwards a hidden gem nonetheless,1
14065,before seeing the sneak preview today of angels demons i cleared my mind of any uncertainties that might hold me back from enjoying it the enormous amount of hatred towards dan brown the fact that it was written by dan brown and because dan brown s name is slapped on all of the posters i went in with an open mind and expected the worse but instead what i got was a 2 and a half hour roman cat and mouse game with forrest gump and that is by all means good entertainment value the movie hangs loosely on the actual novel itself harvard symbologist robert langdon hanks jets off to rome after the pope s sudden death and the re election through papal conclave arranging all of this is the carmelengo patrick mckenna mcgregor however he soon learns of a new threat one that involves a secret brotherhood making its presence known an anti matter time bomb that vatican city is now targeted with and the kidnapping of four cardinals langdon using his intellects and trust me you ll be hearing a lot from it is given the task of finding and rescuing them using the mysterious path of illumination aiding him on the quest is cern scientist vittoria vetra zurer who is also the co creator of the anti matter the movie itself runs at an uneven pace one minute langdon and the swiss guard are speeding to save a branded cardinal the next minute he bores you with pointless information about every random object he passes evidently slowing the book s much anticipated action thriller sequences down it makes for an interesting read on paper but on screen it can go either way the character s are decently written onto the big screen ewan mcgregor does a convincing performance as the quiet but knowledgeable patrick mckenna famous accent included tom hanks is slightly more agile intellectually and physically since his last performance in the mediocre da vinci code stellen skarsgard plays commander richter the straight faced leader of the swiss guard unfortunately neither his nor ayelet zurer s performance are worthwhile ones and instead of playing a part in the story they are just kicked aside as assets however angels demons accomplishes what dvc could never a thrilling fast paced movie filled with satisfying explosions beautiful recreations of st peter s square and basilica including many of the churches and a pulsing bomb counting down the midnight hour ron howard does a decent job at directing this second langdon adventure this time taking in much criticism and almost completely exchanging the boring dialogue for tense chases almost while newcomers might call it a national treasure 3 with a much larger threat there is still enough contagious suspense thriller eye candy and brilliant still shots of rome to breathe in fans of the book might feel differently towards the movies drastic changes but considering the amount of blasphemy and inaccuracy it generates a d does exceedingly well at keeping the viewer locked on to the screen this time rather than on their sleepy shoulder a good book to movie adaption that will both appeal and entertain 7 4 10,1
21511,i ve described this film as surprising this is true in many respects the subject material black man wrongly accused the characters people you expect to be stereotypes often show uncharacteristic attitudes during the film the production all of these factors make for a refreshingly unusual film especially for its time 1949 the only possible spoilers being the sometimes cheesy dialogue and occasional high moral stance but if you happen across it when you weren t planning to watch a film you might find yourself like me staying up into the middle of the night just to see what happens,1
19662,the quintessential let s get ready for summer movie it s dumb goofy and maybe a touch dated but my kids just saw it and they laughed as hard as i did when i first saw it in the style of all little guys versus the establishment movies so yes the plot is very predictable but it s warm and funny and no it s not bill murray at his bill murrayest but he is starting to stretch out in what was his first starring role odd though to see how few of the fresh young faces in this film went on to do much more,1
14422,i m a geena davis fan for life because of this movie i ve always loved samuel l jackson and the two make a great pair on screen this said i think tlkg is the best action movie i ve ever seen forget the twist endings that audiences have now come to expect and that filmmakers now try mostly failing to incorporate into their movies 10 10,1
1065,first off i am a horror fan but this tobe hooper production come on the man from the original texas chainsaw and poltergeist was below standards even for a fan the acting was not bad at all some characters were unbelievable but the leading ladies were ok the story was something we ve seen a hundred times already without any surprising twist or whatever never exciting or intense and do not count on any special effects besides blood splashing up the scary zombie kids are white paled faces with dark eyes and that is it that might have worked in the early 70 s but not now director j s cardone didn t do a good job in keeping the suspense half way thru there is a risk you will fall asleep my vote is based primarily on the leading acting but this could have easily have been called children of the corn 8 from the corn fields to the mines enough said,0
3324,trying hard to fit into the scary space comedy genre this film falls down in two of these it does indeed take place in space but it is neither funny or scary the plot is dismal and the one joke concerning the computer s intellect is overplayed to death saying that paul whitthorne as ethan angela bassett as fran and brad dourif as al bert make the best of their ham script the homo esque relationship between ethan and al bert is hinted at but never explored whilst the attempt at sexual tension betwen fran and rick is so crude as to be laughable all in all this is a turkey that is best suited to late night tv preferably whilst do the ironing,0
16733,the paul kersey of death wish 3 is very far removed from the paul kersey of the original film if you remember the 1974 film then you will remember kersey was a conchie during the korean war and that he was physically sick after he committed his first execution ten years later kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time but i ll overlook that gaffe because dw3 is the best of the sequels lowlife scum bags get shot dead burned alive their teeth smashed and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes yeah i know the gang members are multi ethnic and for that they deserve some credit but even if they re not racist they re still murdering scum who deserve all they get from kersey and the innocent citizens who needs mayor rudy when you ve got paul kersey an anti tank rocket and a bunch of old age pensioners to reclaim the streets from the criminal creeps paul kersey i salute you sir,1
15924,25 sitcoms had big screen spin offs most of these came in the 1970 s here is a list of all are you being served blackadder bless this house bottom dads army father dear father for the love of ada george and mildred the league of gentlemen love thy neighbour the lovers man about the house nearest and dearest never mind the quality feel the width on the buses 3 please sir porridge rising damp steptoe and son 2 that s your funeral till death us do part 2 up pomeii 3 whack o whatever happened to the likely lads and whoops apocalypse so there was a big screen spin off of my all time favourite sitcom dads army what the film focused on was when the men were enrolled it showed the difficulties of getting a uniform and getting weapons it was a big summary of the first series of dads army at the end of the film they catch some german spies in the church the home guard come dressed as alter servers and had bayonets with them and defeated the germans the best bit in the film was when they were showing a hg lecture and a german lecture at the same time german head office on the phone would you get 10 000 bombs cut to home guard godfrey mrs mainwaring on the phone would you get 1 2lb of brussel sprouts this was probably the second best sitcom spin off movie beaten only by till death us do part 1969 it would have been better if at the start of the movie it had already been formed it was half way through the war though still an excellent movie a good one for the family,1
1331,insane really even if you haven t seen the original george cukor movie with norma shearer joan crawford rosalind russell paulette goddard joan fontaine and a cast of a thousand other stars you may dismiss this forced politically correct depressing comedy depressing for many different reasons meg ryan for one what has she done to herself her face can hardly move that alone puts her miles away from norma shearer annette bening should be suing the dp and debra messing what the hell was she doing here actresses with no connection in the public s subconscious trying to pass for friends totally unconvincingly eva mendes in the joan crawford part is an outrageous piece of miscasting what a terrible idea her character is like a trans gender performer without any taste or subtlety bizarre to think that a woman adapted and directed this women the only positive things i can mention are a short but very funny appearance by bette midler and cloris leachman as the housekeeper,0
8010,the wizard of menlo park was deeply responsible for many things we take for granted in 2007 even if he did not invent them without rivals or assistants he gave birth to the electric light the phonograph the motion picture camera the electric car battery the electric power grid possibly his most important but least recalled invention the pre fabricated house and innovations to the telephone and telegraph as well as the ticker tape machine and an early voting machine the total number of patents is over 1 000 far more than any other american inventor but edison was a ruthless business competitor he frequently had vast legal fights over the precedence of his inventions over rivals the best example is the telephone where he was one of seven or eight rivals with claims against alexander graham bell actually edison s invention here was not the central idea that bell and gray had come up with independently of each other in 1876 but an improvement on the sound quality of the phone receiver and transmitter that bell did not develop still it was part of the huge 1888 supreme court decision that was the longest u s supreme court decision a single volume of their reports written by chief justice morrison waite which by the way killed the poor chief justice from overwork within weeks of completing it in 1886 edison found an equally ruthless competitor in the area of electric power grids for large cities this was george westinghouse inventor of the railroad air break westinghouse s firm had gotten the assistance of a new inventor and former edison assistant nicola tesla tesla developed alternating current which was a rival system to edison s direct current edison s system was basically a straight circuit system of electricity tesla s system allowed the current to be switched from one circuit to another actually it was a better and more efficient system but edison was determined to break this rival by a publicity campaign it started with electric power lines edison early on had his lines put underground so that they would not be endangered by weather conditions but westinghouse was forced to have his lines out in the open like telephone lines when there were several accidental deaths by repair linemen on westinghouse s lines in particular one incident where the repairman was burned alive in front of hundreds of horrified onlookers in manhattan s business district edison started insisting that a c current was far more dangerous that d c one result of all this was edison helping some subsidiary inventors with getting westinghouse a c generators and dynamos for an electric chair edison himself always denied that he invented the electric chair but he helped several lesser figures along the way for the complete story read mark essig s edison the electric chair new york walker company 2003 edison experiment himself with cats and dogs experiments he was glad to show the public in the long run despite assisting in the invention of a new method of execution edison failed to dislodge the public support of alternating current but he never stopped trying in 1903 he had an opportunity to combine his campaign against westinghouse and a c with his invention of the motion picture camera he assisted in putting down a well known public elephant topsy who had killed several men he did so by electrocuting the poor beast with a c but the entire killing is on film and one can view it to this day it is a pitiful looking film whatever poor topsy had done it was a poor beast not a machiavellian murderer the moment we see the explosions of electricity sparks that show the death of the elephant we are aware it will soon be over but the sudden collapse of topsy is still an unpleasant sight to view the film leaves a bad flavor in the mouths of modern movie audiences yet sad to say it probably made a profit for edison his description of the film in his catalog of films shows real pride in his accomplishment here in 1903 it may have been exciting entertainment for many americans watching it one is glad that more people are appalled by it today sometimes one can sense the human race has improved a little bit,0
18974,i thought i d witnessed every wrinkle the crime gangster flick had to offer but the garrett marcin hammett combination pull off some genuine thrills and surprises here thanks to the inventively forceful direction by mamoulian the atmospheric photography by lee garmes plus remarkably sharp film editing and flawless special effects brilliant acting helps too coop gives one of his most convincing performances as the reticent hayseed turned fearless bootlegger the sort of character progression he was to repeat in other roles such as sergeant york miss sidney pictured center in her first major role is also an eye opener the principals receive great support from paul lukas wynne gibson and stanley fields as the heavies and even from robert homans hard as nails detective the movie has obviously been realized on an extensive budget which is brilliantly deployed in its realistic crowd filled sets,1
22514,is this a bad movie of course what were you expecting from a movie called beach babes from beyond it is a babes in bikini movie and has no pretensions of being otherwise given this is not a room with a view or schindler s list if you wanted a film like a room with a view then you would not be looking at beach babes from beyond but if you are looking for a good babes in bikini movie with almost no plot this is the one for you this flick delivers on what it promises and then some it is pure 100 adolescent fun there were lots of babes in and out of bikinis the movie was quite funny and great to watch these were some of the most beautiful women i have ever seen on home video every high school kid should watch at least one bad movie like this this is actually one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen so unashamedly i say again if you are going to watch only one babes in bikini movie this is it,1
10160,i just happened to stumble to this film and checked imdb for more information score 6 7 well not so bad genre scifi good i like scifi so i got the movie and i was looking forward to have a relaxing sunday evening watching it but but no as in summary this isn t a movie at all it is a religious advertisement including preatching about jesus god devil end of the world etc movie starts with a epic abduction story driving at night car stops bright light and so on well actually that was the film last of this ummm frankly i don t know what to call it was dialogue about end of the world and last judgement quite a same stuff what these tv preachers tell you but they are good at it honestly if you wan t to see a scifi movie or something with ufos please stay far away from this thing it has nothing to do with them if you want to hear some cuckoo head s opinion what the bible has to say and what you should do then go ahead and watch this thing but i still prefer going to the church at sunday this is complete bull and evangelical christian propaganda as another users said well i should have red another users comments before i got the movie 27 of voters have rated this thing as 10 yeah right please go somewhere else to do your propaganda,0
12233,if you are an insomniac and you cant get anything to get you to sleep i definitely recommend this movie if you are renting it for whatever other reason dont this movie is by far one of the most slow moving turtle motivated movies i have ever seen the only reason i rented it was because my brother wanted to for some odd and strange reason i cant even write about this movie anymore get it away from me,0
4892,think of this film as fan service a wet dream for the slasher genre admirer we start off with a gory prologue which is pretty much unrelated to the rest of the film flash forward nine months and the real meat of the plot begins the virginal mandy lane is coveted by every jock and nerd in her school and gets invited to spend a weekend at a ranch by three guys who think they can get lucky and two bimbos obsessed with their weight and boob size so you have a bunch of young students in a house in the middle of nowhere on a dark night who want to do nothing but have sex do drugs and drink booze the only other company is a hunky ranch hand who may or may not be suffering from gulf war syndrome hmm potential future suspect maybe so as you re probably ascertained by now all the house guests end up being slaughtered in a variety of bloody ways and for a change the black man isn t the first to die there are some conventions that still hold up though like the scantily clad babe being chased by a car in a field or the lights going out mysteriously in the evening as our heroes unwisely separate to tackle the problem even down to the so called shocking twist at the end the movie is like an old 80 s horror updated for the noughties and on this score it succeeds unfortunately it also inherits a lot of the problems of the films of that era too namely the paper thin characters and the predictability of the whole enterprise people get cut up shot bludgeoned etc but because of their innate hatefulness to the audience and stupidity in getting themselves in these situations it s hard to care as the bodies stack up someone gets murdered one of their friends goes out to look for them alone bang they re brown bread rinse then repeat maybe one day we ll get a screenplay with plausible intelligent likable characters who make rational decisions but still end up being outwitted by a genius killer until then we have to tolerate teenagers with the i q of pond life being picked off by a deranged hoodie oh well 4 10,0
21084,this film has an excellent premise and is really crying out to be turned into a hollywood blockbuster as i recall and it s a few years since i ve seen the film the action starts with a london omnibus filled with people there is an horrific crash and one passenger dies the rest of the film is then told in flashback with 13 characters who were on the bus getting their recent lives explored in intricate detail at the end of the film we return to the crash and find out which of these chirpy vivid characters has met a gruesome end great stuff a little like a good tabloid news story fleshed out in precise even handed detail if only it were available on video,1
18386,this film had some very funny moments the aforementioned feeb sketch for starters the parts where rik tries to act dignified in front of his guests looking down at them through his nose very subtly done especially as the guest was a toffee nosed adulterer himself the scene where rik finds out that gina has a fianc ahhh she was stringing me along all the time the brazen hussy with his 2 candle eyes like as if she really fancied him but he believed it that s why it was so funny great moment gino was also excellent he should have been used more as the bad man where are the whores i ordered he bellows brilliant stuff,1
22585,i first saw this movie on ifc which is a great network by the way to see underground films i watched this movie and was thinking it was going to be pure drama and a story line that doesn t hold water but it really was a worth while watch the main character is in such rough shape and you hate to see him deny help but no matter what you just can t hate him his devotion to the beatles and john lennon is a great metaphor for his life and the helplessness he feels the atmosphere of the film is also great at times you feel like you can see what he sees feel what he feels in some situations this movie does not leave you wanting to know more or disliking a loophole in the plot there are no loopholes in my opinion i have always been a fan of foreign films especially now with movies being made so poorly in america i really enjoy the foreign settings because i feel it can take you on a trip and sometimes understand a different culture this movie did all those things to me and more please watch this movie and if you re new to foreign films this is a great start,1
5618,if there were an epa for film then this movie would get their most sincere approval if we all recycled our stuff to this degree we d never run out of anything funny how i was reminded of this movie when i first saw starwars i the phantom menace at least lucas didn t recycle his old footage this is a dud but it s a nice dud cute in spots i liked when the kid said damn rocks and if you like explosions even recycled ones you will get your fill actually for an obviously no budget film it makes out fairly well acting is weak but there is a little characterisation here and there story is predictable but will lead you along anyhow this is an everybody chases the kid type of movie which probably will appeal mostly to younger audiences i gave this one a 2 out of 10 i dug up my old vhs copy of this film i don t think it s on dvd,0
5541,first off the first thing that came to my mind after i finished this film last night was why the title of 8mm 2 because i saw the first one obviously and what did this have to do with the first movie s plot the only thing that was similar was the fact that the couple had to go into the porno industry and that wasn t even needed in the plot because after you see the ending that i will not spoil it just didn t make any sense a diplomat and his fianc e are in hungary and notice a woman who is swimming naked in the pool area she s very attractive so when they see her at a club they decide to have a little fun and have a steamy threesome but things get extremely intense when the diplomat is mailed pictures of them all having the affair fearing that it might go public and jeopardize his career they pay off the guy who sent the pictures the diplomat freaks out and kills the guy leading into a murder case he and his fiacee decide to find the girl they had the affair with but things just get deeper and darker as they go further into what they got themselves into what could have been an alright thriller turned into an unexplained and not well thought out movie which was sad like i said the title really has nothing to do with the first one so don t fall for it it s just a sexual thriller that makes no sense but it s good for those nights alone because quite frankly this is one of those films where it s so close to porn that it might as well be labeled as soft core 4 10,0
717,although humphrey bogart got star billing in king of the underworld i m willing to bet he didn t thank jack warner for it in fact this film was one hollow crown king of the underworld was supposedly a remake of the paul muni film dr socrates but given humphrey bogart was in the cast the character is written more like duke mantee in the petrified forest he even has an english writer along in the person of james stephenson kay francis and john eldredge are a pair of married doctors and eldredge pulls off a tricky bit of surgery on one of bogart s henchmen bogey s a man who appreciates good work done on his behalf and gives eldredge 500 00 and there s more where that came from if he plays his cards right eldredge who has a gambling problem sees a good way to get some undeclared income but when he s killed in a raid on the gang s hideout francis is also thought to be involved by the law and the american medical association no matter how much she protests her innocence it s no good and she and her aunt jessie busley move to a small town to get away from the notoriety of course the notoriety and bogart and an itinerant leslie howard like writer in stephenson all meet up with her again but kay is plucky and resourceful to say the least bogart s character was ridiculous no wonder the poor guy was screaming for better parts he s a gangster who both shoots down people without mercy and gives his henchmen hotfoots just for laughs he s concerned about his image and therefore kidnaps writer stephenson to ghost write his autobiography and of course confesses enough to burn him in all 48 states and then let s kay francis completely outsmart him hard to believe he was king of anything definitely one of the lesser works for either of the stars,0
19156,this game is one of the best horror shooter games i ve ever played the plot is a little choppy but the game never fails to send you plenty of chills and excitement many people shelved the game when they found that there are no cheat codes for it and very little health potions and ammo to be found but actually after you ve gone through the game once you are more familiar with the monsters and different rooms so you can easily get by the second time around the puzzles are great not too hard not too easy there are tons of different monsters so you never get bored and there are plenty of gaming areas you really feel like you re in a good stephen king novel as you play it s nice and creepy pick this game up cheap and have some fun,1
9817,i don t care what anyone says this movie is hilarious it combines the bleak seriousness of threads with an anarchic blend of alternative comedy and the results are a severely dark but outrageously funny satire on the brinkmanship policies of both the western and eastern blocs at the time you gotta give the filmmakers credit for even attempting to top the real life lunacy of duck and cover or protect and survive imagine someone made a movie based on the dead kennedys track kinky sex makes the world go round and you re pretty close to whoops apocalypse add rik mayall on top form as an insanely ott sas commander and you ve got it exactly a worthy companion piece to dr strangelove and that s saying something,0
13528,the portrayal of the marines in this film is spot on the action scenes are some of the best ever produced in accuracy of content the uniforms and weaponry of both the u s and german troops were perfect the costumes and weaponry of the berbers were perfectly accurate as well this film could easily be used to teach militaria of the period and has been used by the usmc academy for this purpose the scenes depicting roosevelt shooting and the rifles he was using was beautiful procuring so many period weapons in such good shape is testament to the attention to detail and presentation this film should be noted for millius is a genius,1
16789,years ago when i first read john irving s the world according to garp i was astounded that most of the younger adults with whom i had contact didn t like the book when i loved it i began to understand that it was an age and experience thing i experienced somewhat of a d j vu when reading some of the comments on this site that were clearly written by younger viewers fully enjoying separate lies is surely an age and experience thing in this film the viewer sees a seemingly happy upper middle class couple he a successful lawyer she the perfect wife of a successful lawyer they have a townhouse in london and a home in the country all s well until there enters the villain in the guise of the son of the richest man in the village this guy appears to be a cad from the word go he is disdainful of everyone and everything including his own children in the traditional form of nice guys finishing last the lawyer s wife engages in an affair with the bounder you see the lawyer really is a nice guy but with the marriage killing trait of an organized perfectionist even though he truly loves her he is boring his wife to death the bad boy is far more exciting all of this is entangled with the hit and run death of a man in the village in which all the facts point to the cad being the driver of the vehicle it s easy to determine that this movie doesn t build to a happy ending however it does lead to a very satisfying ending in that the man and his wife learn and grow from their experiences and probably will be able to conduct their personal lives in a more successful manner three excellent actors play the main characters in this film and it is there performances that make the whole thing a pleasure to watch tom wilkinson is perfect as the husband his portrayal shows us a kind man who has so much control over his emotions that he has lost touch with the world emily watson shows us a woman who has become so trapped in the role of perfect wife that she has almost lost her knowledge of passion that passion is reborn by the character deftly played by rupert everett if you have reached that point in life in which you understand that everyone has feet of clay and that everyone even with the gifts of intelligence and opportunities makes many many wrong decisions then you will probably enjoy watching these excellent actors creating the lives of three such people this is a beautifully acted and directed adult film about realistic adults,1
19877,whatever you do don t stop watching when you think the movie is over hang around for the first batch of credits or you ll really miss something we saw this movie at the savanaah film festival and thought it was the best of the bunch dreya weber is a marvel really not only because of her performance but because she can pull it off so far above the ground at the q a she said there were no wires or effects so everything you see is really her going for it addie couldn t make it to the festival because she was dancing with madonna she was excellent and my gawd so beautiful i was amazed that the film went over so well with the blue haired lady crowd but there you have it savannnah isn t a backwater,1
14780,the story of sweeney todd evokes memories of the work of classic writers like charles dickens and more contemporary writers like edward gory as a musical it naturally becomes more like the musical les miserables both deal with the grim effects of poverty in the industrial revolution and the breakdown of organized society but this musical is different from les mis in one very important aspect stephen sondheim the songwriter who can adapt to any style to be sure he s had his successes and failures but one thing about his shows you can always count on they will be something unique who would have thought someone would write a musical about a barber who slits people s throats and makes them into meat pies sondheim did and he did it marvelously the entire show is set in a factory to suggest the ever present catastrophic effects of the misery of those at the bottom of society and this serves the needs of the show perfectly the catwalks and railings are moved throughout to suggest streets and walkways and bridges techniques are borrowed from kabuki and noh with the visual stagehands and set changes then to top it all off cast the great angela lansbury as the gruesomely practical and humorous mrs lovett and george hearn with his operatic baritone voice as the murderous todd and you ve got yourself a stellar musical vehicle the rest of the cast moves smoothly through the clich s of the love story perfectly except for johanna and pirelli who sound a bit too forced if the johanna and pirelli from the broadway show could be here it would be perfect hearn acts while he sings more than len cariou on the obc album and the accents don t sound as forced here through it all sondheim s score never fails to underline the dark seriousness of the story as i said he can adapt to any style in follies he imitates the 30s 40s style of showtunes in pacific overtures he captures the subtle art of asian music into the woods knocks off the 32 bar disney style songs and assassins covers a history of american music here however he does wonders in making his score distinctly english from parlour songs to operatic duets and soliloquies to society waltzes to gilbert sullivan style patter and yet still the show remains deadly serious even though it provokes more laughs than any musical comedy in it still is a grim warning on the evils of taking revenge here is where this movie makes a mistake in cutting the judge s solo in which he flagellates himself out of guilt for his crimes without it the judge is just a conventional villain and this movie s point is that there are no straight villains both todd and the judge learn too late the horrors of having to accept responsibility for their actions and todd loses everything in his obsession this is well brought out by the chilling reprise of the grim yet rollicking ballad of sweeney todd ending the show with todd and lovett rising from the grave to tell us that the end is the same in a world full of sweeneys vengeance begets only vengeance attend the tale of sweeney todd he served a dark and a vengeful god to seek revenge may lead to hell but everyone does it and seldom as well as sweeney as sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street,1
6359,this movie has some of the worst acting i ve ever seen dennis quaid s performance was high school caliber while it s difficult to portray an off the wall character like jerry lee lewis it can be done just ask jamie foxx although ray charles had more depth to his personality and musicianship than lewis ever dreamed of possessing the phillips brothers portrayal belonged in the dukes of hazzard and alec baldwin playing jimmy swaggart is a bit like donald duck performing shakespeare when robert duvall played a country preacher i bought it baldwin never made me believe a single word wynona ryder s part was the best and she was mediocre and can anyone figure out how she was 13 when lewis met her and still 13 more than a year later some checking on the internet reveals the essential facts presented by the film were true at least no more fouled up than most hollywood bio pics this film did badly at the box office and it should have,0
4548,anyone who sees this film will notice that the makers threw a lot of money at this film it s interesting they titled it the hole the production values are good for a short film the hole tries to look big budget and does in some ways but is hampered by the video format it was shot on i speculate if this was shot on 35mm it would look incredible and would elevate the content somewhat many hollywood movies look good and that s enough for an audience regardless of story and content my honest opinion 3 out of 10 for this effort maybe ishimoto s next film will deliver,0
12439,i ve been surprised by the enthusiastic response to this film it seemed dull to me much as i enjoyed looking at penelope cruz and the plot details often poorly worked out it also seemed like an intensely sexist film if the gender roles were reversed almost everyone with any sense would be up in arms complaining the movie is intensely misogynist it s not just that both the principal males are portrayed as complete jerks and sexual predators but also that the women are portrayed as almost flawless forming a utopian community which lacks conflict of any kind and which rests on relentless generosity and good humor utopias are notoriously dull and this one turns out to be no exception but it s also interesting to notice what happens and here comes the plot giveaway though it refers to a very early scene when the teenage daughter kills her father 1 her mother rushes to take responsibility for it and 2 the daughter seems to suffer almost no remorse and in fact her emotional life then disappears from the film it s not quite a glorified killing though aldomovar s camera lingers on the blood in a bloodthirsty way as though it makes an attractive painting and then it s soaked up and out of sight without bloodying either daughter or mom neither materially nor emotionally later the film reveals another killing again by a woman of a man and once again it is a killing which the film implicitly endorses in short volver is an ideologically driven film with an unpleasant and in fact a repugnant ideology and so i write an ideological critique but apart from that it s just not very interesting it has none of the depth of say aldomovar s talk to her which i loved,0
18601,the d i 4 outta 5 stars wow i certainly did not expect to be enjoying this movie as much as i did i had never even heard of it until i saw it sitting in the discount video bin one day i figured jack webb playing an army drill instructor might be good for a chuckle but figured the drama would pale in comparison to such recent movie d i s as portrayed in full metal jacket or an officer and a gentleman boy was i wrong this is probably the best work webb has ever done far and away better than his one note dragnet performances the delivery of his tough guy dialogue is just brilliant done in his patented deadpan monotone and yet you know that the guy means every word of it the story might seem a little hokey compared to the grittier military movies that have followed but i still found the movie fascinating and compelling even a completely unnecessarily musical interlude in an army nightclub had me hooked anyone know where i can get a copy of that terrific ray coniff song if n you don t somebody else will webb plays the toughest dang drill instructor ever and he s under pressure to kick out the deadbeat private owen but by golly he sees a man buried somewhere in that sissyboy and he s gonna drag him out kicking and screaming great stuff,1
22251,random hearts snuck up on me criticized for the implausibility of a the premise and b the pairing of an ia cop and a congresswoman as well as for its slowness the film felt just fine to me and even ended up being surprisingly absorbing i found my interest engaged as the film cut back and forth between ford s and thomas s lives as they first found out about and dealt in very different ways in very different environments with their spouses deaths and the subsequent revelation that they were involved with other people it could happen two people s philandering spouses could be on the same plane the plane could go down the survivors could be brought together by the aftermath so what if it s improbable improbable is not the same as far fetched so what if it did happen why not speculate ford s and thomas s performances are believable and nuanced instead of finding their coupling implausible opposite sides of the tracks give me a break i felt it driven by a grief and betrayal neither party knew how to deal with the script does not bring them together too soon or too easily and the end of the film does not resolve their relationship conventionally either where i find it unsatisfying is when the dialogue brings up interesting wrinkles in or insights into the ramifications of the situation personal and professional but never seems to pursue any of them very far and if you make the mistake of thinking about it too hard harrison ford does seem about 10 years too old for the part for five and a half bucks at wal mart with full length director commentary and behind the scenes featurette the dvd is well worth owning i don t think i would pay 20 for it on a bet but my wife might ok ten,1
22315,i have seen this film at least 100 times and i am still excited by it the acting is perfect and the romance between joe and jean keeps me on the edge of my seat plus i still think bryan brown is the tops brilliant film,1
18647,god bless joe d amato i love italian horror cheese movie wise sci fi etc this one admittedly was a bit harder to watch but another fun bad movie i like how people preface a negative review with i normally enjoy bad movies but no buts this was a bad movie for people who love bad movies it s one of my top bad movies miles o keefe was a poor man s conan but oh what fun who can t have fun with a primitive nuclear bomb a hangglider and a cheesy rubber monster it s fine to hate this movie if you only like hollywood drek like titanic or pretty woman but if you truly i mean truly love bad movies check this one out this is one of those movies that are fun to rent for a beerbust or when you have a couple buddies around and looking for a little mindless fun my rating 8 10,1
16530,ok so this film may not have won any oscars but it is not a bad film the original d o a is undoubtedly a better film but that does not mean this film is bad the film stars dennis quaid in one of his early roles when he was first becoming really famous after the right stuff made him a star and a very lovely looking meg ryan when she was still now quite famous this is more of an update of the 1950 film rather than a remake since the setting is different and the characters too are different the plot is pretty much the same a man this time an english professor at the university of texas at austin is poisoned and he has only 24 hours to find out who poisoned him and why meg ryan plays a young college student who tries to help him jane kaczmarek plays quaid s estranged wife in a low key but intense performance she steals every scene she is in daniel stern also in an early role before home alone made him famous plays quaid s colleague charlotte rampling is fine too in a supporting role the entire cast is top notch the film is stylish with a quick pace that keeps you guessing until the end i think this is a film that is certainly worth watching as a thriller and as a modern version of a classic film,1
6396,after watching the steven spielberg version of war of the worlds in theaters i was hooked on the topic i could think back to my favorite parts in the movie people getting vaporized people panicking fire explosions it was all so great so a few weeks later i enter my video store and i see david michael latt s version of war of the worlds on the shelf it couldn t have come onto dvd that fast could it i said to myself i read the back of the case and saw c thomas howell instead oh i remember him from the outsiders so i thought it might have been a try i was wrong dead wrong as soon as i watched the opening credits watched them take forever i knew something was wrong something was going to disappoint me in this film and it did the whole movie stunk like a cheese sauce that was left in the fridge for 10 years from the acting the special effects stupid looking tripod things when people get vaporized they turn into orange skeletons and most of all it didn t even come close to being as interesting as the spielberg version in fact the plot was boring and there were only 3 scenes of destruction what the crap i ended up being so bored that i had to fast forward through the movie until i found something that looked even remotely interesting and nothing was really my advice don t even touch this movie stay 100 feet away from it the spielberg version is coming out near the end of this month buy that one but please please i beg of you stay away from this turd before it smothers us all,0
23994,i liked this movie i m not a big horror movie buff so i couldn t comment on similarities between this and other movies of this genre but i found this movie quite captivating the story line albeit a little obvious had some genuinely scary tense moments and the acting particually of the lead female role wasn t bad in anywayoverall i m a little surprised at the low rating this movie has gotten i watch a lot of movies working in a video store tends to help and this really isn t as bad as people seem to think i do have some criticism though the final call from the cop was terrible almost overacted the dead girl in the bathroom looked liked she was having a little sleep probably from the amount of tequila she mentioned she drank and the children s reaction to what was happening instilled in me the hope that they were ultimately killed hope this helps some people,1
24075,this story about a man s 28 year struggle for a death that would liberate him from his already dead body becomes a masterpiece to be remembered thanks to a team of artists in a state of grace directed written edited and scored by alejandro amenabar it touches you from the very first images and doesn t leave your eyes and your heart to rest until the last credits thanks to alejandro and a group of wonderful actors and actresses at their best bardem is an acting animal one of those few comedians that can make a masterpiece from almost any character the supporting actresses are great in their roles and the story is told with such a sensibility that one laughs and cries in the same minute as we used to do with the great old masterpieces the year s best film in all senses 10 10,1
1707,i was so offended by this film that i had to write something about it so please humour me its only redeeming virtue outside of some good acting is that it doesn t go on past 107 minutes even that length is about 30 minutes too long comparisons have been made here to the brilliantly dark the grifters but i can t see it they are two different films altogether the closest swindled comes to an existing film is the sting made in 1973 it borrows sorry steals liberally from this splendid george roy hill entertainment which is exactly what is was i enjoyed it because it didn t pretend to be anything else there are so many red herrings in swindled that i thought i was in a fish tank it s very confusing but that s only one of its many problems the principal one is this if you make a film where everyone lies to everyone else where everyone is conning we have no anchor to ground us the inevitable result is a mish mash of very sloppy seconds from other caper flicks just about everyone in this film is conniving and objectionable surely a basic film 101 class would tell us that the audience has to care for someone we can t care for anyone here they re all swines it might have worked as a rakish comedy but it plays it straight from beginning to end if you want to see this film read no further big spoiler coming sorry but i have to do it there s so much fake blood and so many fake killings that it doesn t strain credulity it destroys it the ending is absolutely ridiculous a murder in a crowded airport that isn t really a murder at all and the murdered guy blood soaked simply stands up brushes himself off and walks away fake blood dripping with the booty all while the police and hordes of people are looking on and no one intercedes the director must have a lot of cojones if he thinks we re supposed to buy into this noirish b movies from the 1940s did better i m a great fan of european flicks but this confirms that schlock doesn t always come from hollywood as far as swindled is concerned my judgment lies with a famous line from the oft misspoken producer samuel goldwyn who knew all about schlock include me out,0
7668,how living the dream managed to get into the laemmle 5 in west hollywood is beyond me as it is the worst film i have ever seen in my life i should have known when the first scene opened in gasp eugene oregon that this dud of a film with characters that you want to like and feel sorry for from their exclusion days from high school but can t as they are such losers is so wooden and atrocious with dialog that is beyond bad then clich the three high school losers end up in la and here is where the film could have been realistic if it had shown them trying to find a career in acting but no one works as a used car salesman the other is a true loser in a garage call center selling magazines even the bastard that runs the place has more audience appeal than that dreadful actor with the horrible foreign accent and they fraudulently get money from an insurance scam to set up an executive recruitment firm with no experience just showing the supposed good life in la night spots with a cast of actors that are so wooden and bad they better not have sag cards i could go on and on about this bad film but i ended up walking out of the theater which had at the start six people and when i left four men were the only ones in the audience i wanted to like this film but i couldn t find one merit in the story characters writing dialog nor the actors whoever cast this film should retire amen enough,0
13860,i heard that after the first oceans movie the sequels begin to go downhill i believe that this is not the case at least not for this film this movie is even better than the first film the original crew returns three years after they successfully robbed terry benedict s casinos now benedict is visiting each one of them personally telling them to get the money back within two weeks to do that they must do a couple heists in europe to get the money the acting is very good the all star cast exceeded expectations matt damon brad pitt and catherine zeta jones were probably the best in this film there are some confusing moments in this film but that does not matter because there are only a few confusing moments anyway this movie is only made for harmless fun overall this is a great heist movie i rate this movie 9 10,1
9442,the brands in this film like suit supply take away from the story cause it s supposed to be set in the eighties it s not a very thrilling film also the single from intwine on the soundtrack is very bad it has a chorus that is repeated numerous times like i m a cruel man i take it all away i m a cruel man i m here to stay jeeez couldn t those asswipes have come up with something better than that i guess they wrote it in a couple of minutes it s really annoying just like the product placement in this filmproduct that cashes in on the controversy and publicity around a criminal who should not be a celebrity like he is now made out to be but should be forgotten like rats ought to be,0
950,bubbling just beneath the surface of showtime is a good idea actually it s more like two or three ideas that constantly fight for screentime this film doesn t just have its cake and eat it too it has the whole bakery detective mitch preston robert de niro has a drug bust interrupted by the media and a brash cop slash actor named trey sellars eddie murphy when preston s partner is shot he angrily shoots the camera out of the hands of a pestering newsman and the tiff lands him in a new reality cop show produced by chase renzi rene russo in the first of many errors and oddities in the movie that injured partner is never heard from again or alluded to for the remainder of the film de niro s best gag is his speech to a classroom of small children to open the picture about how tv cops don t act like real cops funny thing is as the movie progresses his character and murphy s begin to act more and more like the clich s they supposedly clash so strongly with in a smarter movie de niro s diatribe could have played as ironic comment here it only shows to point out how truly lame the movie is while a spoof of a reality based cop show could be funny the team of writers and director tom dey who made the far superior shanghai noon a few years ago see that movie instead seem to be on unsure footing and instead of slamming the tv industry they really let them off light the harshest thing they seem to be able to say about network execs is they like to play ping pong at work russo s character has a glint of fiendish delight in her eye but her dialogue and actions rarely match the actress enthusiasm with little on screen to keep my attention my mind began to wander and that s dangerous in a movie with this many plot holes for instance if showtime the name given to the cop show is such a popular smash why doesn t anyone seem to recognize de niro and murphy when they are on the job for that matter if their investigation of smuggler and all around mean guy vargas is being televised why the heck hasn t someone mentioned to him that they are on his trail then again given this villain s actions maybe i shouldn t be surprised this is the same joker who is very angry at an associate for using his new supergun without approval jeopardizing a deal and then dispatches him how by using about ten of the superguns to level his entire house of course that s like putting out a fire with a bigger fire occasionally showtime gets laughs but there simply aren t enough for the film s nearly two hour running time even worse the really smart gags suggest that this movie really could have been on to something if only they had put in a few more drafts of the script murphy mugs and talks as fast as he can with minimal results and de niro looks flat out bored through most of this after a completely unnecessary fistfight between cops and gangsters that remarkably results in no injuries and no arrests russo s character shouts that s great television perhaps it s great television but it s far from a great movie,0
22509,tale of two sisters has to be one of the creepiest films i ve seen recently in the end there is no actual supernatural element despite what one is led to expect throughout the film the story seems to be about two sisters who upon returning to their father s home after some sort of absence later revealed to have been a stay in a mental institution are forced to deal with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bi polar stepmother who lashes out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells them she s prepared a special dinner at another time but some presence as yet unexplained it is later revealed that the younger sister is dead and exists only in the troubled minds of her older sister who was unable to save her and her step mother who was callous enough to let her die much about the specifics of the strange family is not revealed in the film but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a nagging hint of confusion definitely not light viewing watch this one when you really want to think about what you ve seen it s a hell of a puzzler,1
13474,the japanese have probably the most sadistic movies around the world and this is one of the strongest examples with a running time at about an hour it contains enough sexual violence and gore to disgust every single sane person on earth even those who are hunting this type of movies three men and a woman are making a porn film after some normally shots which are pixelated the girl is tied up and the madmen cut her food arm and tong after that they make a hole in her abdomen and a man has sexual intercourse with her intestines he is knocked unconscious too and has his penis cut off the special effects are good for an obviously low budget production only the tong cut scene looks fake and we can t talk about acting direction or screenplay after hearing a lot about this film i was very happy when i finally found it the first part is pretty boring but the second one totally f k up my mind the torture and killing scenes being some of the most extreme and disturbing i have ever seen the gore hounds will be satisfied by tumbling doll of flesh but an unknowing viewer shouldn t even read the synopsis,1
8867,i ran across this movie on a local tv channel last night frankly i have never heard about this movie before simply i lost track of seagual s recent movies for each one is worst than the previous one here again we have a dull seagal as if he was insisted by his girlfriend to make this movie and he accepted forcefully the plot is ridiculous acting is below zero and there is no single aspect the movie is not falling apart i simply don t have any idea why seagal did this movie man it is even worst than out for a kill if you watch this movie you will start feeling sorry for seagal he seems to be running out of ideas enthusiasm and money avoid this movie and do something worthwhile,0
17909,and i would have rated it higher than a 7 out of 10 if it wasn t for the seriously uneven irish accent of barbara hershey in the leading role of mother madalyn the accent came and went unfortunately which i found more than a little distracting however the performance of william l petersen in the role of joad was outstanding he brought a warmth and depth to the character in spite of some periodic hokey dialogue captivating and genuine i found him quite astonishing in the way he captured the character the premise of the film is fairly simple the building of a forgotten staircase in a church it is based rather loosely i believe on a true story and i had heard of this staircase prior to seeing the movie it was a phenomenal engineering feat for its time a floating double helix made without nails or screws it exists to this day although it is now in private ownership minor spoiler good supporting cast and barbara does dying so well in all her movies and here she doesn t disappoint lots of special moments 7 10,1
24671,great little short film that aired a while ago on sbs here in aus get a copy if you can probably only good for a few viewings as you ll end up remembering the script and it s the twists that make this film so funny well directed and intriguingly scripted it s an example of just how good low budget short films can be,1
1976,i have to ask myself do movies like this get their support by people associated with the movie itself coming here and critiquing it how can something so awful score this high my parents went to see a lot of the more adult themed movies when we were kids anything with an r in it until we were old enough i only remember two films that had them saying yech when they got home this one and catch 22 the movie is comprised of bumbling physicians and staff in a filthy hospital rambling narratives and a pack of inner city people who look like rejects from a 1970s norman lear sitcom staging a protest the worst part is the murder mystery a crazy old guy doing god s work by killing doctors and others when he confesses scott and his girlfriend show little emotion they only care about him getting out of there where he will be safe and happy a doctor that drops dead of a heart attack is faked as the man so he can get away oh my what a fun movie this movie didn t make me think chuckle or have any other feeling other than it must get better but it never does people wonder why it was a failure no wonder here i wonder how imdb has enough members that think this movie is good yech,0
23613,i managed to obtain an original bbc broadcast of this film on video and loved it so much i had to try and locate the original video in its original box thanks go to ebay deleted on any format since 1990 this exceptional wildlife film is finely constructed and well acted directed by stewart raffil mac me the scenes of leaping tigers running through the alaskan wilderness is nothing short of stunning and its timeless tale of a trapper trying to survive on his own in the frozen wastes with two young tiger cubs is moving on each viewing why no major company has picked up this movie to distribute on dvd is a big wonder but makes it that extra special to know its also hard to locate if you find this film by chance or eventually track it down to add to your collection make sure never to let it vanish out of your grasp films of this calibre as shown don t come often a true masterpiece in every sense of the word and highly worthy of its praised comments when the north wind blows will sink deep into your heart as soon as you see it,1
7099,my poor tank girl they ignored everything great about you why does it have as little to do with the comics as possible i would have loved a movie that followed the plot or at least had the characters right why was tank girl american she s austrailian dammit and she s not living in a post apocalyptic war zone either she lives in the outback with booga like a savage she does it because she wants to live that way not because she has to because malcolm mc dowell is acting the git and why s she looking after those kids the only children in the comics end up violently being choked by her it s terrible that they made her into a lame mother figure and my poor jet girl and sub girl in the comics jet is a sarcastic wisecracker and sub girl is another sarcastic wisecracker with a weird sense of humour in the movie jet is this mousy little thing and sub is this ditzy middle aged hag and booga doesn t look or act anything like what he s meant to be either though maybe hot roo human love was too much for the usa box office the humour was so lame too whatever happened to all the stuff about the smiths and that brilliant slang they used all the time what sort of line is will this take long i don t wanna miss baywatch even programmes for tiny children can come up with better material than that,0
2931,this film is bundled along with gli fumavano le colt lo chiamavano camposanto and both films leave a lot to be desired in the way of their dvd prints first both films are very dark occasionally making it hard to see exactly what s happening second neither film has subtitles and you are forced to watch a dubbed film though il prezzo del potere does seem to have a better dub personally i always prefer subtitles but for the non purists out there this isn t a problem these dvd problems however are not the fault of the original film makers just the indifferent package being marketed four decades later as for the film it s about the assassination of president garfield this is a major problem as van johnson looks about as much like garfield as judy garland in no way whatsoever does he look like garfield he s missing the beard has the wrong hair color and style and is just not even close in any way trust me on this i am an american history teacher and we are paid to know these sort of things the real life garfield was a civil war general and looked like the guys on the smith brothers cough drop boxes plus using some other actor to provide the voice for johnson in the dubbing is just surreal never before or since has van johnson sounded quite so macho he was a fine actor but certainly not a convincing general or macho president in addition to the stupid casting president garfield s death was in no way like this film it s obvious that the film makers are actually cashing in on the crazy speculation about conspiracies concerning the death of jfk not garfield garfield was shot in washington dc not dallas by a lone gunman with severe mental problems not a group of men with rifles however according to most experts what actually killed garfield over two months later were incompetent doctors who probed and probed and probed to retrieve a bullet to no avail and never bothered cleaning their hands or implements in the process in other words like george washington who was basically killed by repeated bloodletting when suffering with pneumonia he died due to malpractice in the movie they got nothing right whatsoever other than indeed president garfield was shot because the film bears almost no similarity to real history it s like a history lesson as taught from someone from another planet or someone with a severe brain injury why not also include ninjas fighting robots and the greek gods while you re at it aside from some decent acting and production values because the script is utter cow crap i don t recommend anyone watch it it s just a complete and utter mess,0
12084,one can only sit in utter amazement at this mess of a film and be amused at some of the raves people have bestowed upon it the biggest problem seems to be the director s inability to make up his mind as to whether it s black comedy farce or a combination of both it meanders all over the place in search of direction and has some utterly embarrassing performances that might be better suited to bad sitcom what a shame to see the talented dianne wiest s comic talents squandered and the ever annoying jane birkin is so over the top she s more bothersome than usual perhaps a lot of the positive criticism is due to the quirky french nature of the film therefore it s labeled smart or genius it s neither instead it s bad tripe that leaves a rather rancid after taste merchant ivory should stick to the serious stuff as they certainly have no comprehension of comedy,0
2502,there is no real story the film seems more like a fly on the wall drama documentary than a proper film so this piece may in itself be a spoiler teen drama about 3 young singaporean kids very similar to uk chavs who play truant from school run with gangs get into fights insult people on the street get tattoos hang about doing nothing etc etc they generally imagine themselves to be hard and every so often shout challenging rap chants into the camera filmed in mtv style fast cuts crazy camera angles tight close ups and animation interludes the dialogue might have been crisper in the original languages of mandarin and hokkien than in the subtitles and i have no doubt that some of the contemporary singapore references will slip over western heads as well as the cultural and political context unless of course you are familiar with singapore this kind of teen film may be a first for singapore but it has been done before and done better in other western countries la haine 1995 for example,0
5565,i only watched this because i saw a couple of good reviews for this so i was expecting at the very least a half way cheesy movie toybox doesn t even deliver that there are so many problems with this flick that i don t even know where to start so i will list a couple of main issues once again spoiler warning just read them it ll save you the trouble of watching this later one this movie starts out with and often mentions the mythical folklore of both celeste noir a witch who the main character claims she is the reincarnation of and the mid folker or something like that an evil man with a big smile who cuts people open with hooks and sells their innards in pies i liked that it was a cute concept anything to do with pies is simply enjoyable but then you watch the movie and it s all about this idiot girl and her boyfriend and what was the deal with him was he psychic did he have powers why did he keep seeing visions that even the so called witch didn t notice and them meeting their insane family not really insane they just argue a lot that s what most of this movie is arguing and they barely touch on the supposed myth ever again except in a couple of confusing scenes that you can t make heads or tails of in one scene berenice the main witch related character wanders off and does some sort of ritual by candle light it seemed rather important but absolutely nothing happened after she did it it just wasted more of my time and who the hell was that guy with his dog you see him walking towards the house from the very start of the movie with that evil red eyed dog and then he finally gets there and gets killed what the hell was he the mid folker was his dog possessed did someone kill the dog they never really showed that also any scene involving the vicar was completely pointless and only served to weakly explain the lame ending it was like they had all these interesting character ideas and they all went nowhere the boyfriend who obviously had some sort of powers but never explains them the grandmother who appeared to also have some sort of witch powers but never used them the vicar who ok never mind there really was no point for his existence at all and then there was berenice and her stupid amulet could she really do magic or did she just use it to reflect light and blind people this was a complete waste of time and the only reason i give it two stars at all is because a berenice is kinda cute and b it mentioned pies save yourself the money of renting this and dear god don t even think about buying it unless wasting money is a new fad,0
1810,sorry this was a woeful excuse for a film a plot line so holey it resembled a block of swiss cheese and a butch of characters who seemed to me to be utterly devoid of inter personal relations well except of course for carlyle and lee miller who i could have sworn were meant to be in love unlike the union of tyler and miller who were for the most part like the rest of the film utterly unconvincing although the end product was uncaptivating and amusing for all the wrong reasons the production values were high and deserve some acknowledgement but unfortunately the end result was rubbish what was everyone involved thinking they definitely should have packed up early on this one,0
15701,i can t help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten to be honest i saw the preview for this movie and the premise looked intrigued me yes i rented it after reading others comments they are correct in that some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired they are also correct that one of the best performances of this movie was that of dr graves also interesting is scott clark who plays grant the kid in the wheelchair i identify with the character he played perhaps because i am in a wheelchair this movie is certainly worth your looking at,1
2779,am i the only one to notice that the realism of the 19th century ship is erroneous actually it s a 15th century right around 1620 if memory serves me because the realistic ship in the movie is the mayflower now as far as i know the mayflower never went to australia or even attempted a voyage to australia i don t know who handled r d for this film but using the mayflower and hoping that no one will notice is a poor job indeed they even printed it on the cover art and the dvd i wonder how may other people noticed this little blunder not to mention that the movie itself was just plain awful i would have expected better from sam neill,0
14339,i am a firm believer that a film tv serial or any form of art should and would be fully appreciated once the timing factor as to when written produced or conceived should be taken in to account yeh jo hai zindagi is one such series i remember watching it in the mid 80 s on tv and the re runs via the video cassette libraries during early 90 s and laughing out loud and being addicted to it that made me buy the full series dvd set and surprise of surprises the comedy and the moments of the good ol days simply fell flat for me even the very popular 30 years ka experience gulaaaab jamun and sofa cum bed did not invoke the kind of mirth i thought it would the timing factor for the 80 s this was the showstopper the main event the mother of all tv comedies and it worked during the age and time perhaps the same cannot be said right now but nonetheless watching the dvd did bring back pleasant memories i wish the seasons with shafi inamdar and swarup sampat were longer satish shah has been un believably good as the heart of the show with equally effective support cast of farida jalal tiku talsania and the bengali neighbours rakesh bedi hams throughout all in all an experience that will bring back memories for those who saw it during the prime times might not appeal to the younger viewers or first time watchers,1
4530,another stinker from the pm entertainment group and thankfully one of their last firetrap is effectively a very low budgeted remake of the towering inferno i don t mind low budget b movies as long as some effort is put into them there is no effort whatsoever in firetrap is stars dean superman cain who is an absolutely terrible actor seriously he has all the acting abilities of a porn star but he turns out to be the best actor here and that s saying something the rest are just a bunch of no hopers given the boot from various daytime soaps the special fx are just rubbish shots showing the burning building from the ground are among the worst i ve ever seen the fire looks like someone scribbled an orange pen at the front of the camera on top of that there is not one character you actually root for you hate everyone and hope they all die well before the 90 minutes are up the script is embarrassing the red herring s are signposted well in advance someone else has mentioned this but the scene where the janitor fights off a blazing fire engulfing the building with his broom hilarious or same janitor going into a room marked hazardous material were these scenes supposed to be tongue in cheek somehow i doubt itthe one good point and only one good point was there was a fair bit of action in amongst the daytime soap dramatics which kept my attention but so little care was given to everything in the film i can t recommend it watch the towering inferno instead3 10,0
9506,i rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case judge and jury started out pretty good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool gun but this movie got progressively stupider as it went on david keith is awesome actor especially when he plays a role like this too bad the movie was a piece of crap it really wasted his talent judge and jury was well plain dumb i gave it a 3 should have gave it a 2 i gave it an extra star just because david keith s gun was cool,0
3987,if you re not a fan of the 80s and you need to be a particularly strong fan or of one of the two leads there s nothing about this film to recommend the story as others have said is dull almost an afterthought to the basic notion of the characters and the idea of making a slightly manic comedy i watched it to about an hour hoping it would turn a corner a twist would occur or it would somehow kick into gear but no it s not unwatchable it s just dull it goes by it goes by with bits of running around madly lingering shots of feet at strange angles bits of shouting madly but i didn t get a real feel of energy or manic fun it just came across as forced needless to say also there was nothing to laugh at particularly a bit of mild amusement here or there but nothing more don t be fooled by the mention of feminism by the way all it means in this case is that almost all the principal cast is female if anything it s actually cloying two female leads fine excellent the drug dealer is female okay their landlord is a landlady alright their friends are female okay the only other person we particularly see who lives in the same building oh female i wasn t on the lookout for that but after a while it felt like a conscious decision had been made to have the film cast that way and it felt again a bit forced and cloying on the plus side if you are a fan of 80s fashions and culture there is plenty to see and if you re a fan of helen slater she s fun and enjoyable to watch there s also some screen time for carol kane which is great but not enough overall 3 10 if you re a huge fan of the 80s helen slater and carol kane you could maybe stretch it to a 5 because of them although there s still the fact it s a comedy which isn t funny which hinders it substantially if you re not a fan of those things you might as well make it 0 because there s nothing much else to enjoy here,0
12670,two years after the success of airplane jim abrahams and jerry david zucker created this brilliant sitcom starring the great leslie nielsen as plain clothed detective frank drebin also in the cast was alan north as captain ed hocken ed williams as ted olsen and william duell as johnny the shoe shine boy police squad featured unashamedly corny jokes and clever visual gags playing in the background each episode would conclude with a mock freeze frame in which the characters in frame stand completely still one of the best freeze frame sequences saw one of the characters pouring coffee into a cup while standing still causing the cup to overflow guest stars were killed off in the opening titles one included georg stanford brown being crushed by a falling safe despite gaining positive reviews and much critical acclaim squad only lasted for six episodes before being cancelled this didn t mean the end though five years later the show was transferred to the big screen for the first in the trilogy of the naked gun films,1
15636,one of my favorite westerns and one of john ford s best in my opinion no major stars but ben johnson shines in most everything he appears and here he gets a rare lead as the title character matching him is ward bond as the crusty mormon elder leading his people west john ford s stock of character actors including harry carey jr jane darwell russell simpson and hank worden provide ample support as does eerily silent james arness a member of the outlaw clegg clan that joins up with the wagon train the mormon trail into utah was one of the most arduous and demanding enterprises ever undertaken we can t really get the feel of that but we do see ordeals that had to be overcome by pioneers on the way west river crossings long stretches of dry waterless desert encounters with indians and the like all set to glorious song by the sons of the pioneers the mormons actually did dig sections of the trail with picks and shovels as depicted in the movie my main regret is that it wasn t made in color but i believe there is a colorized version by the way those craggy rocks featured in various scenes are called the fisher towers located near moab highly recommended viewing,1
3005,a professional production with quality actors that simply never touched the heart or the funny bone no matter how hard it tried the quality cast stark setting and excellent cinemetography made you hope for fargo or high plains drifter but sorry the soup had no seasoning or meat for that matter a 3 of 10 for effort,0
12726,i won t bore you with any synopsis chances are you already know them and hopefully you are already familiar with park chan wook s work i strongly disagree with some of the other commentators in saying that park has not moved on from the vengeance trilogy blah blah blah because you know what he has the vengeance trilogy were different from each other in style to begin with how can you even compare the sombreness and subtlety of sympathy for mr vengeance with the frantic and extravagance of oldboy park chan wook has incredible style but his movies don t all share the same style that has been true and remains true with the release of thirst thirst is an incredible picture it literally has everything you want in a movie jaw dropping violence tasteful gore great humour incredible suspense and even very realistic sex scenes the story is so crazy that at no point can you guess what will happen next i m so happy to say that park is back in top form with this fantastic dark comic vampire love story watch it as soon as you can,1
249,fran ois traffaut s mississippi siren had an unconvincing plot the screenplay required too much elasticity in suspension of disbelief the plot went at a glacial pace it started off in an interesting setting but soon drifted onto the shoals of melodrama that lacked logic or intelligence what were the critics thinking this one is overrated even to be described as a loser even catherine deneuvue who charmed in the umbrellas of cherbourg and belle doe jour managed to be simply annoying we rented this movie at the same time as we rented another traffaut film we watched this one first and found it to be so bad that we sent the other one back unseen at the same time,0
14557,black scorpion is roger cormen s batman which is cool and there is a lot of cool stuff in this movie like the breathtaker being a cross between doctor doom and darth vader that s kind of cool the mind control gas in the inhalers was worthy of the mad hatter the cormen b movie style is all over this puppy which is not always a good thing there are plenty of stunts and hot babes to make any action fan happy this movie the good out weighs the bad but if you aren t one for comic book movies then i would advise not watching black scorpion however if you like comic book like movies and don t care if it was ever a comic before then check out black scorpion as for me i give it 8 stars,1
13444,much better than expected good family flick catch it on reruns the whole is more than the sum of its parts paul giamatti chews up the scenery he has way more talent then the role deserves a treat to watch inspector uhl from the illusionist go over the top the blue man scenes had my 11 year old in stitches the cameos were particular fun for the parents nice to see lee majors and urkel umm jaleel again it s going to be tough to think up 10 lines for this film but let s hear it for a movie that promotes honesty between a child and their parents amanda bynes does a fine job when she gets to be part of the sting i normally can t stand frankie muniz but he is just fine here hats off to the casting director if only for hiring giamatti,1
20335,a tough life gets tougher when the three children of a single mom are scheduled to be sent to separate foster homes after her untimely passing to stay together the older boy plans a daring high risk escape to find a distant lost uncle their only remaining next of kin their trek takes the three fearful runaways on a chase through the desert in a classic beetle penniless hungry desperate terrorized by delinquents and too young to drive hunted by the ever threatening civil authorities what the movie lacks in acting and plot realism it makes up for in the honest human need to be a part of a fulfilled and complete family even if that family is cobbled together with spare parts of broken lives sure the ending is forced and too over dramatic for the critical movie goer but every heart beats the same cry for family togetherness and belonging with all its weaknesses i still give this movie a strong recommendation,1
9167,please if this is about technology and what man does to kill others and ourselves i think i missed his entire point because i walked out feeling like reggio relied on cold war era footage of space exploration and had nothing new to add to the dialogue about fears of technology trails of 1 and 0 denoting technology and math and science done that anyone out there see the matrix and motion studies of people in motion ever heard of edward muybridge at least he uses exact clips of muybridge s photographs of human motion studies this film was derivative and the score is just enough philip glass to sound like everything he s done in the past 10 years avoid this film at all costs,0
18658,minor spoiler inhabited isn t scary but it is creepy it is an interesting little story with good acting and great special effects makeup basic plot a little girl blames the strange things going on at her family s new house and accompanying playhouse on her faerie friends the movie doesn t waste time getting moving though the ending could have been more involved i don t recommend this movie to those expecting wanting hardcore horror but i do recommend it to those who want a chiller and not necessarily a thriller,1
20501,this sequel proves that tim burton was for all intents and purposes the best choice to ever direct a batman movie the story focuses on baman taking on three enemies the penguin wonderfully played by danny devito catwoman the slinky michelle pfeiffer and max shreck the superb christopher walken perhaps the best entry in the series it has it all complex themes complex characters and a dark tone that truly stands out the cast is simply wonderful although the obvious stand out is devito as the multi layered penguin here is a guy who is evil pitiable funny and perhaps most importantly scary the infamous scene with shreck s image consultants still sends shivers up my spine in other words the cast is simply a joy to watch and all turn in first rate performances i do not hesitate to say that batman returns is my favorite of all the batmans released sorry dark knight fans if you want a superhero film that has a little more to offer besides flashy effects and big scale action then please check out this badly underrated film if nothing else it s at least the best film tim burton has ever made,1
10541,i went to see this movie with my boyfriend last night i m 20 years old and this movie was way too much for me i couldn t imagine taking a teenager preteen or especially a child to this movie it was crude and offensive i was totally misled by its pg 13 rating and the previews that i had seen for it i had originally seen previews for it on nickelodeon and i thought that it looked pretty cute maybe i just don t remember the preview correctly plus drake bell the movie s main character stars on a nickelodeon television show that targets preteens and young teenagers i really didn t think that the movie s content would be as risky as it was i should have done more research about it before i went however i m hoping that parents will read up on this movie before they take their kids to see it just because it has drake bell in it seriously do not take your kids or teenagers to see this movie the rating should have been r there are tons of sexual references drug references and disturbing events throughout the movie examples drake bell gets attacked by sexually charged animals several scenes that involve men grabbing women s breasts lots of profanity drake bell uses a bong to smoke vanilla frosting or something like that people get stabbed hit and hurt in the movie and an elderly lady and her dog get shredded there are tons of other offensive and disgusting scenes throughout the movie it was really demeaning to women in general the movie is by the people that made the scary movie series so that should tell you something right there please remember that seeing movies like this can give kids and teenagers all kinds of wrong ideas about sex drugs and violence most children and teenagers can t decipher between spoofs or comedy and reality i do have a sense of humor i also know that the humor that was in this film is typical of its genre but i find the possibility of children and teenagers going to see this movie horrifying as for the overall quality of the movie i didn t think it was that original or funny it dragged in parts and some of the humor was just forced and painful the acting wasn t too bad considering how bad the script was if you re an adult or older teen looking for a funny movie skip this one or rent it,0
8352,i was hoping that pulp would be a interesting movie but was profoundly disappointed pulp has very little storyline and what there is never holds your interest it was a real struggle to keep watching it when its over you say to you self huh that s it this is one where you think after watching it why did they ever bother its too bad since michael caine is a good actor i was also hoping to see the great lizabeth scott in this but she only appears on screen for a total of perhaps one minute scott is one of the all time great film noir femme fatale girls and this was her last film oh well,0
4282,i saw this as a kid before it had been yanked from the rotation and even then it left a bad taste in my mouth there were some competently worked out gags but making slapstick villains out of american citizens who d been interned in camps strictly due to their race was amazingly tasteless moe himself might have wanted this one buried he was a liberal guy in his autobiography he told of visiting a town in the segregated south where he saw a black man get off the sidewalk to avoid passing too close moe stepped into the street to show it wasn t a problem and the man then got back on the curb then off again finally the man told moe nervously that if moe didn t stop trying to share the sidewalk with him he might get them both lynched another thing there are exploding ostrich eggs but no oxen in the film so the title should actually be if anyone cares the yolk s on me,0
16010,one of the many backwoods horror s that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the better ones yes it has a cheesy plot but i was pleasantly surprised at this film because i thought it was really good and really entertaining although the killer could have been made a bit more scarier he just looked like a fat slob first of all we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is who warns them not to go to those mountains as they are very dangerous but when the teens arrive it doesn t seem very dangerous at all well according to me anyway it s a shame that we don t get movies like this any longer and if we do it s usually some boring terrible film this movie more relies on tension and being scary than gore because the gore factor is really low in this movie which i wasn t pleased with but other than that it s still a great movie all in all you ll have to search long and hard to find this movie and if you do find it you will like it and also watch out for ending with the final girl and the killer it s totally not what you d expect,1
20298,i had the privilege recently of viewing what is said to be the last 35mm technicolor stereo print and found it much livelier and more touching than remembered also closer to the original material basically all screenwriter n richard nash did was trim change much recitative to spoken dialog and insert a transitional scene or two including a very amusing one for pearl bailey oliver smith s production design is stagy in the li l abner guys and dolls 50s adaptation mode but it works well for this work s folkloric unrealistic quality stereotyping and racism are present but not to a wince inducing degree further for a movie of its time it s pretty frank the adultery violent behavior drug use and self destructive habits of the denizens of catfish row are not at all minimized in the telling but there are debits beginning with all that variation from the stage text the loss of so much compromises gershwin s brilliance no wonder the family doesn t like it the reorchestration especially of sammy davis jr s material is disconcertingly trendy and vulgar george knew what he was doing folks you didn t have to mess with it so much and while poitier and dandridge act well and their singing doubles sing well there s a huge chasm between the characters singing and speaking voices you re constantly aware of the artifice what really counts here of course is the music among the greatest ever written for the theater anywhere despite all the tinkering it survives and you d have to be made of stone not to be moved by it if the treatment isn t entirely to the estate s liking and it shouldn t be there s still no reason not to spend some bucks to restore this ambitious filming of gershwin s masterpiece and make new generations more aware of his genius,1
18207,so well made no cgi crap has anyone else been on the jumping crocs tour of darwin s adelaide river before black water was way realistic rogue was a bit cringeworthy thought the blonde chick was excellent in it haven t really seen her before and the other chick is a babe she is always excellent v suspenseful i would compare it to jaws over any other man eating animal flick got the hole aussie thing down pat without going ott with struths and crikeys as well loved it,1
23784,all right it was in black and white and probably on 2 tape which means the bbc wiped it right but it stays in my mind from all those years ago 1960 as a perfect slice of history enlivened by the most innovative editing and wonderful actors full of youth and bravado i want to see it again are you reading this bbc find your original 2 tapes or the 35mm film deal with the actors and directors for the rights and re issue i know i know some of them are dead some of them are missing in action where else will i be able to see mary morris as the serpent s heart wrapped in a tiger s hide where else will i be able to see paul daneman do now is the winter of discontent or robert hardy deliver his speech about that idol ceremony,1
19573,i am definitely not a gamer but a couple people in my family and my boyfriend are so a little reluctantly i decided to find out what the big deal was with fantasy stuff i saw dorkness rising and thought it was hilarious it s slapstick but not disrespectful to those that enjoy role playing games also and most importantly people who ve never gamed before can enjoy it and not feel left out or lost trying to understand the plot the acting was great and the field shots set were believable this makes me want to see other movies by this production company i can t wait to see what the future holds for this group three cheers well done,1
15067,the king of queens in my opinion is a pure cbs hit despite the fact that i ve never seen every episode i still enjoy it very much for that reason it s hard for me to say which episode is my favorite even so i must say that cbs really knows how to make a good sitcom before i wrap this up i d like to say that everyone always gives a good performance the production design is spectacular the costumes are well designed and the writing is always very strong in conclusion if this show lives on in syndication after it goes off cbs i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good,1
9795,being a former mst3k watcher even i found this movie unwatchable the awful attempts at humor heck the awful attempts at acting nobody needs to read a harangue on this piece of junk i just like how all the positive reviews were clearly written by cast members or family friends just click on their other reviews and wow they are all reviewing modern vampires give me a couple of bucks and i can make a movie better than this one of the most incompetent pieces of film making i ve ever seen and that s saying something watch at your own risk rating 0 10,0
19673,here on earth is a surprising beautiful romantic tale about samantha who has both boy problems and health problems as her love for her current boyfriend jasper fades away her love for kelley blooms like a new spring flower i found this movie very touching very warm very romantic and touching i enjoyed every bit of this movie and that s pretty rare i highly do recommend this movie to all movie lovers this is one film you don t want to miss dby the way if you re a very sentimental person who easily cries while watching movies bring tissues on the other hand it was a really really good movie very romantic and surprisingly good d,1
7574,this movie has more goofs than any other movie i have seen in my life the special effects are damned terrible for instance near the end when the concorde is falling after the cargo door tears off the thing spins like a toy the special effects of airport 1970 are way better than this crap also the force of a concorde opening up at altitude and speed would essentially turn the thing inside out that is if it would even open at all but the movie has its good points mostly when it ends that s also cheesy e g the thing lands on a bank of loosely packed snow if it did that it would splinter into a million pieces overall 2 out of 10 instant flop great laugh flick,0
17773,in 1989 aardman animations introduced the two heros in the grand day out in 1993 they fought an evil penguin in the wrong trousers and in 1995 they had to rescue sheep from an evil robot dog in a close shave in 2005 they re back and they are going to fight something that used to be cute and cuddlely in the curse of the were rabbit in this full feature film wallace and gromit work in anit pesto a pest control business there s going to be a giant vegetable competition but rabbits keep eating the neighbors vegies wallace and gromit takes care with that problem but wallace had an idea he will brainwash the bunnies with his machine after doing that something suddenly eats all of the vegies in the neighborhood and it s big it s up to wallace and gromit to save the day as a fan of these two characters i was impressed it kept what the 3 previous chapters had and instead adding a lot of hollywood actors for voice overs they put a no name cast to the job and boy they did a fantastic job wallace and gromit has not changed wallace is still the cheese loving freak like he always was and gromit is the silent newspaper reading dog also the script was not too shabby like other family movies were there is a twist of who the were rabbit really is the direction from nick park the director of the 3 previous chapters does a really good job with the storyline instead of adding the hollywood formula in it he just took the style of the previous chapters and adds a bit of a dark fantasy twist in it well done nick the rabbits are also funny and adorable but the funniest rabbit in the movie is one who has the mix of wallace in him the characters were not bad and they weren t annoying but they ll never top wallace and gromit the animation is indeed fantastic and wonderful i ve never seen a clay animated movie that is so amazing since chicken run overall fans of the two knuckleheads including the teens will love this fantastic film it is a well done film that should get an oscar next year hooray wallace and gromit 10 10,1
19987,a vehemently cynical sarcastic and intense film mocking and imitating the style of pulp fiction and stylized gangster films thursday is an entertaining off putting and hilarious thrill ride an amazingly eclectic mix of over the top characters and bizarrely entertaining situations this day in the life of a gunman trying to go straight proves to be a worthy addition to the series of films that attempts to mimic the genius of tarantino s dark humored masterpiece pulp fiction nick aaron eckhardt stops by casey s thomas jane house to catch up on old times casey was a former gunman for drug dealers who has since reformed become an architect married a successful businesswoman paula marshall and is now contemplating adopting a child nick who still has ties to the gangster underworld leaves a briefcase full of drugs at casey s house while he borrows his car to run a few errands a k a unfinished business disgusted and angered by the introduction of drugs into his home casey flushes them all down the kitchen sink that s when one at a time nick s double crossed accomplices rapping rastafarian drug messengers and crooked cops all come a knocking for the unsuspecting casey who is about to have one unbelievable thursday the film opens with a hilarious sequence in a gas station in which nick is looking for the best deal for a cup of coffee after pondering which size cup to get a fiasco breaks out with the cashier when he demands a free snackie cake and uses a 50 bill to pay resulting in comically brilliant bloodshed the situation goes from bad to worse when a cop intervenes and is caught in the most unusual of circumstances this opening segment establishes the perfect mood for the rest of the film which never takes itself too seriously and includes outrageous characters that seem self aware of their own existence in this nonsensical gangster flick the film is broken into segments based on various events and times during the course of one day this effect is much like pulp fiction which is a similarly given chapters although thursday doesn t mess with chronological order except for the occasional flashback also like tarantino music magnificently introduces each scene and each character oddly humorous creatures such as the jamaican hit man pizza delivery guy that raps over the phone and shares his hashish and paulina porizkova s narcissistic dallas who attempts to rape casey add humor to each event regardless of how horrifying and unnerving some of the coincidences are when mickey rourke s calmly spine chilling crooked cop kasarov is introduced the careful staging and intricate setup is fully assembled and casey s sticky situation becomes even more daring and laudable definitely a wannabe pulp fiction with plenty of violence witty dialogue and extremely creepy antagonists thursday does some things right but other attempts at homage may be going just far enough as to suggest rip off a flashback sequence that shows casey shooting up baddies and sporting a hairstyle that exactly matches john travolta s do in pulp fiction is easily one step too far mike massie www moviepulse net,1
6996,a vehicle for michael caine its fairly well written and there s some ok acting in it but really it s a mess not funny enough not frightening enough it s a flaccid modern cockney thriller i like the premise that even in the refracted moral hinterland of east london people do do things for the right reasons a surprise result to the first proper fight caine s old school billy shiner has promoted inflames his paranoia the second half of the film has him chasing shadows to deal with the disappointment of the outcome of the first my greatest disappointment was in director john irvin s failure to make more of the relationship between shiner and his lieutenant filial substitute frank harper harper s a british tom sizemore understands his role well whilst those around him seem to have ignored it pity 4 10,0
18555,the main point of the movie imo is the fact the joanna s whole life has been nothing but a series of facades the movie opens up with her secretly dying her gray roots and hiding the used kit in an empty tissue box what is strange is that she is hiding this from her husband if she has to hide mundane things from her loved one one can bet that she is hiding even bigger things from others involved in her life when joanna accidentally hits cory she leaves the scene to call the police by the time she returns the police and ambulance are there as well as people from her community remarking what kind of person hits a child then just leaves her there well respected in her community she makes the decision to keep quiet about what she had done but she never realized how difficult it would be the keep up her facades great movie i have seen it many times,1
2060,cyber zone as this dvd was sold in oz is about the worst b grade junk i have seen apart from a restrained deadpan act from singer indicating he knew how bad the movie was going to be the other actors sway about genuine attempts at line delivery swanson and quarry or absurd imitations of classic movies scenes mathius hues makes the most ham fisted portrayal of dying since jim carrey s mask all of this with no real thread to suggest an attempt at a spoof by genre period or any common vein is plain annoying don t even try to join the dots with the plot it is blade runner thinly disguised with no content actors or scenery due to a very limited budget you gets what you pay for is never more apparent there is repeatedly annoying re use of limited sets with no attention to set dressing and a spew of special effects that would have hit the cutting room floor for dr who in 1976 the helicopter explosion is worth a rewind to demonstrate my point of course there are masochists that will lap up this tripe but if you are watching this movie for a bet make sure you get more than your pay rate at 2 this dvd will make a cheap and interesting beer coaster,0
5534,i don t honestly know what legal or illegal substance they the writers were on when the wrote this horrid piece of tripe the cast sucks the plot sucks the editing sucks the whole premise of the movie is that a girl with psychic telekinetic powers comes across a lesbian vampire sorority you just have to be totally out of your head to watch even 1 minute of this the only reason i had to watch it it was on the here network as part of a two picture purchase and the movie that came on after it was the real one that i wanted to see i fast forwarded through the whole thing and was just amazed how stupid this movie was in double speed do not rent buy or watch this movie the vampires in the movie don t suck as much as the overall movie and production does if you want a good lesbian vampire movie the hunger with david bowie susan sarandon katharine deneuve excellent movie to watch own rent in place of this piece of pure sh t,0
3009,if this movie had a point i never discovered it a very depressing movie which supposedly is about the final evacuation of the residents living in a dam site area on the northfork river in montana the problem is that there is no actual northfork river in montana there are several north forks but they are branches of other rivers which divided into north and south forks the opening scene of the movie is a coffin bobbing to the surface of the lake but the scene is never tied into the story and the viewer is left to speculate as to its meaning but much is left to the viewer s speculation in the movie another example is when a team of dam employees responsible for the evacuation of the residents arrives at the dam headquarters another group of people are departing some remark which is almost inaudible is made about these people which makes no sense whatsoever and there is no followup in the movie to explain it the movie is butchered into several stories and the film keeps switching back and forth between stories which is quite disconcerting and the stories are weird in one of them the occupants of one property refuse to be evacuated because they are living in a home that is built like noah s ark another senseless story centers around a sick orphan who is dying and somehow he is sharing his presence with a house full of ghosts and in an orphanage with a priest at the same time if anyone can figure out what the ghost story was about the author must have explained it to them the scenery was stark and the sun never shines there are snowy mountains in the far distance i guess the purpose was to set the mood the time period is set by the fact that the evacuaters all drove ford sedans of the 1946 48 era although the events are supposed to have occurred in 1955 the acting was mediocre when i saw the billing for this movie it said that darryl hannah was in the picture if she was i didn t recognize her but i surmise that she was the ghost lady,0
1761,a real hoot unintentionally sidney portier s character is so sweet and lovable you want to smack him nothing about this movie rings true and it s boring to boot,0
24847,yeah i guess this movie is kinda dull compared to some of pam grier s other films the plot is overly familiar the dialog stilted and some of the acting isn t too good but it s worth seeing for the lengthy stretch near the end of the film where we see ms grier in a sexy blue wetsuit with the zipper half unzipped yeah it seems like a frivolous point when discussing an actress of pam grier s talent but she also happens to be an extremely gorgeous woman and back in the day she had a body that wouldn t quit it s nice to see it being showcased in a tight wetsuit rent the dvd and then tell me i m wrong can t can you that s because you know i m right and yes i really did give a 10 just for the wetsuit scenes,1

14348,this is definitely a touching movie and a great expression of charles darwins personal struggle the movie is not only about his struggle to get his book the origin of species published but also his relationship with his oldest daughter his daughter was at start the only person in his family to approve of his views something that she as well had to pay for een more than him at times now this is not an evolutionary propaganda film as a matter of fact i think it managed to stay very neutral a hard thing to do in my opinion of course it does not condone the way the characters was treated by the church quite the opposite actually if you need me to use the big words to shed light on this film it will be liked by deists and atheists alike but goes away from theism the movie talks about evolution and that s it paul bettany as charles darwin was incredible of course we all may think of darwin as that old man with the funny beard but this movie centers around the man in his late 20 s early 30 s jennifer connelly emma darwin is great as always but the actor who impressed me was martha west as annie darwin darwins daughter definitely on of the best child actors of the decade the story is about darwin and his daughter and it is beautifully acted except for a few jumps in time that was momentarily confusing the production of this film is pretty flawless some scenes were darwin observes nature is just marvelous and is almost like taken out of a high production national geographic documentary i must admit though i m not quite sure of why they chose creation as the title i doubt it is an irony the movie is too respectful for that well i m sure there s a meaning too it just don t let it scare you away i give this movie a 9 10 this is truly a great tribute to charles darwin and please give it a chance,1
23695,the first time i saw the poster i was stunned by its tranquility and beauty then the city of istanbul has been haunting in my mind ever since not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture it itself is a landscape actually there are a lot of things going on in the film but the director deliberately omitted most dramatic parts and leave them to our imagination thus creating a really flat life mild spoiler one can see mahmut s ladylove crying in the toilet and then going out without a word but not their fight one can see mahmut accompanying his mother in the hospital but not her struggle from illness the most dramatic scene in the film to me is yusuf laughing out loud for the toy soldier he bought for his niece and that s when it almost broke my heart to see this boring lonely life bursting out in such a way with all the trivialities in life weeded the story presents us with pure inner world of all the characters their sadness anxiety loneliness regrets and as the story unfolded i sort of finally grasped their desperate situation where their emotions were really no way out if no outer things intervened which is exactly every loner tries to keep at all cost especially for an irresponsible artist like mahmut i ve just finished my second watching last night i crouched into my quilt had some vodka beside my bed and went through the whole film in a trance i felt two real lives going on one outside the screen one inside the screen i felt free from all those loneliness and anxiety cause the people inside were experiencing it i just had myself removed from all those things we cannot deny the universal problem of communication and loneliness even puts us far towards it and it becomes a vicious spiral i bet mahmut still didn t figure out a way of living in the end that s why he stepped out of his room to try to find the answers from the outer world the coldness and landscape,1

11223,i admit i was taken in by the provocative stills of charlotte lewis from this film as well as a comment on the imdb message board devoted to her calling this picture a great underrated film and so i got with great difficulty my own copy of dial help what a waste nothing but a cheaply made blood and gore movie with a ridiculous premise which i m not even going to repeat with several telegraphed sequences for instance when we see lewis lovingly feeding her fish we know right away what s going to happen to them later not even lewis with her beautiful raven hair large and luminous brown eyes full and pouty lips and stunning figure can save this film lewis fans would be better off with bare essentials sketch artist or even golden child,0
5222,this well meant film falls just a bit short and unfortunately in too many areas the scenery is gorgeous with vistas of north central vermont providing the setting for this mid century tale quebec bill endeavors to go back to his whiskey running past in order to save his farm going back and forth between scenes of magical realism and straight forward action this film rarely hits its stride kris kristofferson as quebec bill seems pretty stilted or else it s his lines or else his cross of yankee and quebecois accents anyway he just comes off as a low key blow hard his dialogs with gary farmer s coville character do sparkle though william sanderson s rat kinneson is solid charlie mcdermott shows some real potential as young wild bill but his part s not large enough to carry a scene and he never steals one luis guzman shows up on lake memphramagog with a fine stand in performance by lake willoughby as a monk with a boys n the hood accent who knows and then there s bujold s cordelia an oracle like her namesake she channels yoda as she intones lines like you will marry a quebec woman just too weird and nowhere near enigmatic enough the end gets really choppy again a bad mix of magical realism and the concrete and yoda never provides an answer we can understand,0
15747,i think that mario van peebles movie posse is a very important film it is an excellent entry point film to a side of history many are not aware of this is a story of early black settlers cow boys and infantrymen returning from the spanish american war with a cache of gold the main character peebles is haunted by memories of his murdered father the racism applied to the new black settlers and infantryman is explored in this film with excellent casting including melvin van peebles marios father billy zane stephen baldwin and a wonderful performance by big daddy kane one senses that peeples strived to use as many notable black and some not so notable smile actors as possible perhaps too many some notable persons issac hayes pamela grier are only scene in cameo others briefly such as tone loc the sentiment and efforts of peebles efforts to expose these actors will be understood by some the large cast a feat for any director work well and do a good job of telling the story in the classic revenge and fight vs justice western most noteworthy was the wonderful narrative role of veteran actor woody strode from once upon a time in the west who s own life was a barrier breaker within the context of a previous era not yet completed faded from memory no other actor could have done this role better read the mini bio on woody strode here as a primer http imdb com name nm0834754 bio the film does a good job of balancing action with a bit of sardonic humour the dialog was excellent if a bit contemporary and as others have mentioned the profanity was not accurate to that period the sex scene was a bit much not really needed there are some historical inaccuracies such as the seeming electronic branding of the cattle etc but posse is a good effort to hopefully open the door for more historical and creative works reflective of other untold stories and events the actual photos of real cowboys at the end credits was very nice touch,1
3267,watch this movie only to truly appreciate how good the original is i m not real hard to please but this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen it hurt me deeply because i like chevy chase jackie mason and dyan cannon the writing was just terrible i thought chevy would have at least ad libbed some better stuff than he did there was hardly anything to laugh at in this movie i went into it wanting to enjoy it i wanted to laugh but nearly cried in the beginning credits it read special appearance by chevy chase this worried me from the start chevy is actually in more than i thought he would be it s more than a special appearance too bad the appearance wasn t special mason s character would have been a good secondary character but got old as a main i would rather have seen more much more of dyan cannon at least her character was fun if not well written i also missed the gratuatis teen sex scene mr gopher went from being cute and innocent to a pesky rodent that deserved to be blown up jonathan silverman is the only character that interested me and we didn t see enough of him i take it back try to watch half of this movie then remember the alamo the maine and caddyshack i,0

6015,i m at a loss this entire movie made absolutely no sense it was like watching a soderburg film for football the camera cutting the pace all so copied i thought the subject was too not serious for them to treat it like it was yes we all know southerners like football and beauty pageants must we be inundated with it as an audience i watched because of lee and jay i was expecting young talent assembled in the style of dead poet s society or similar to remember the titans i was completely put off by the film you didn t get the characters it was character driven but you didn t understand anyone s motivations or their actions for the most part the one kid who s mom is obsessed with him being a football player why is he so silent what s his deal did we really need the scene with him proving his heterosexuality why should we care the movie gave us insights into these kids lives and offered no pay off for caring it just made no sense and why show a movie about a team that lost i know it s real life but who makes movies about losers give us some pay off for these guys working as hard as they did with all their conceivable problems darnit we got nothing we got a little blip at the end of the film telling us that mojo won the next year with the 3rd stringer lee why didn t you follow that story what were we to get out of this one the movie led you along but didn t lead you anywhere i just felt like something was missing it felt like a bad genetic cross between varsity blues and remember the titans at least those two movies led you somewhere friday night lights was about a loser team that lost their star player early in the movie the actor who played him was great you were completely annoyed by him which was the point but at least you understood why they made sure you understood him but he couldn t play so why make sure we get his issues and the other team in the play offs are we to believe those are high school teens those men looked like college seniors or professional player in their 30s who were they trying to kid i know the other team was to look intimidating but that was crossing the line a little i liked the gritty element of them negotiating with the black team but again how did this fit into the overall theme of the film nothing pieced together the characters knew more about each other than we did and that settles weird with me jay s characters had absolutely nothing to add but he was showcased it was all just a mess not worth a movie ticket or a rental fee,0
2136,just desserts was i must say one of the worst movies i have ever seen the acting was terrible and even the plot line was laughable i gave it a 3 out of 10 instead of a 1 because i enjoy laughing at excruciatingly corny movies my expectations weren t high to begin with but it turned out to be cornier than i expected i thought it might not be all that bad when it started but as soon as the name of the competition the golden whisk came up i began changing my mind it all went downhill from there the only thing i did like about this movie other than snickering at it s absurd plot and dialogue was watching them cook however being a movie about pastry chefs there were minimal scenes in which they actually baked anything i would recommend watching the cooking channel instead of this movie you get to see more food being prepared and you dodge the pathetic one liners however if you enjoy corny love stories which is sometimes fun go ahead and watch,0
8549,the satirical movie website dateline hollywood joked that son of the mask was all a practical joke star jamie kennedy played on new line cinema for his show the jamie kennedy experiment if only and if only the movie had been half as funny as that satire piece the mask was the ideal vehicle for the face pulling jim carrey that so many viewers dote on it also delighted males over the age of 12 by introducing cameron diaz so having a followup minus both of them was not a good idea plus you d have thought new line would have learned their lesson after dumb and dumberer when harry met lloyd but no though to be fair having an all new cast is in keeping with the original comic in which the mask went from owner to owner as written by lance khazei and directed by lawrence guterman however there s nothing there in return except a steady stream of admittedly decent fx by the usual squadron of houses industrial light and magic improving on the ally mcbeal dancing baby and their own baby s day out with the tippett studio giant killer robots digital dimension and so on in support and an even greater pandering to cartoon fans by having our hero work at an animation company responsible for such gems as siamese popes naming his character after tex avery and working in not just references to classic cartoons but actual clips the trouble is that last approach doesn t really work partly because most of the attempts to bring cartoon trappings to live action fall flat especially the cars getting in the party mood and mostly because the tributes to the flintstones woody woodpecker duck amuck and especially one froggy evening show up how weak this movie is in comparison plus the movie fits in shambolic slapstick alongside strained sentiment the underlying theme of the story is family our hero isn t ready to have a son and his nemesis alan cumming as the norse god loki is far from the apple of odin s eye and what bob hoskins is doing here as odin even after super mario bros is beyond me and kennedy just isn t in the same league as carrey in the zany stakes though it s not like he gets any help from the script also note that unlike diaz the very cute traylor howard as the mother of the son of the mask doesn t get much to do giving her the mask might have helped the movie further points are lost for throwing away cumming hoskins steven wright and magda szubanski for a suspiciously abbreviated running time which would account for some gaping plot holes and scenes that seem to be missing and for an incredibly bad attempt at an inside joke when our hero fails to sell the concept of the green guy as an animated tv series the mask did become an animated tv series in real life and was a far better follow up than this sequel the fact that this actually opened in britain before the us should tell you everything what with this and blade trinity new line seems intent on cornering the market on dreadful sequels with cast members from two guys and a girl what next the butterfly effect 2 with nathan fillion somebody stop this,0

11053,julie delpy stars in this horrific film about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in france of the 14th century the film attempts to shatter the romantic chivalry image of the heroic medieval knight by showing a rather dreary image of the period defined by psychological dysfunction and violence the movie opens with a child fran ois growing up in the shadow of the hundred years war told by his father to keep his mother safe and to wait for his return fran ois takes action when he discovers his mother with a lover in bed fran ois murders him in the name of defending his father s honour like father like son fran ois grows up and leaves his family also to go to the same war this setting is somewhat of an explanation for the events to come as on his way home we already notice that something is wrong with fran ois the war has not done well with him he has changed the daughter b atrice de cortemart delpy awaits her beloved father to return from captivity of the english she is pure of heart and she was left to take care of the estate while her father was gone in her father s absence b atrice needs to deal with financial difficulties which strengthens b atrice s hope that her father will return to save her but upon his return she notices that he lost the will to enjoy life and he tortures and humiliates everything around him even his own daughter from this points the film depicts various ways how fran ois torments his family starting with humiliating his own son and ending with the rape of his own daughter b atrice setting the film in the middle ages supposed to soften the blow as the viewer may tell himself that these kind of violent acts were held in difficult times and indeed many films on the topic of incest such as tim roth s the war zone 1999 which are contemporary were more shocking because of that delpy appears in this film in several daring nude scenes indeed she appears to be angelic and beautiful i was annoyed when i saw some animal torture scenes i believe and this is not confirmed that some birds were killed for the making of this film which really upsets me the quality of a film drops when real violence is used towards animals i would hope that this movie will be re released without those cruelty scenes those scenes do not contribute much to the film storyline overall the movie is too long the script is problematic we don t get to see fran ois and b atrice before the war we don t really get the answer why is he changed to such extreme i would have pass on this film however i have to mention a few scenes that made this film worth watching scenes of a young child being able to murder in cold blood is truly shocking i saw it first time on city of god 2002 here fran ois murders his mother s lover while his father away at war excellent scene and very graphic the scenes from b atrice being raped by her father till she finds out she is pregnant from him are truly shocking and interesting the scene after the rape where delpy burns her cloths and cleans herself she asks her brother to kick her in the stomach with hopes to have a miscarriage the brother humiliation scenes where the father dumps his son s head into the food humiliating him then ranting about the war later dressing his son with women s cloths the film won the c sar french oscar for best costume design i agree the costumes here really make the film look authentic for the time period the movie location is ch teau de puivert a real 12th century castle and a historical monument located in aude south central france beautiful castle and mountain view really helps you set into the period of this film the film also nominated for 3 more c sar awards but they were all snatched to the widely successful french film au revoir les enfants goodbye children 1998 released as beatrice in new york city march 1987 only to be screened in france on november 2007 watched it on yes3 on 3 may 2007 17 45 at work,0
11837,we all know that the world is full of dodgy rip off horror films some of these can be fun to watch due to their stupidity awful effects and iffy dialogue but raptor which could have been in the same league as the equally pointless carnosaur series does not even attempt to have any enjoyment in it its so poorly done it is really unbearable even if your just watching it with the intentions of having a no brain day at home where do we start well the sets are pretty drab my old drama group created more realistic stages the genetics labs look like they are from a university and it looks equally unbelievable on the outside even for cover up why would you place yourself near civilisation where people can easily hear the dinosaur roars whilst the doctors ward just doesn t look believable at all next up in the complaints list is the creature effects well what can i say absolutely pitiful also i think it s worth mentioning the woman s tits should be mentioned as an effect both of the main female characters have so obviously had boob jobs and it brings the characters down being one female is a respected member of police whilst the other is the sweet innocent daughter of the towns sheriff the acting though is by far the worst tragedy eric roberts can be excused for at least trying a bit to give his role something thats where it ends corbin benson should have killed his costume designer for making his lacklustre performance look even more pathetic whilst the female lead looks so bored though with this film you could let her off the other character i ll point out is the daughter who lets her tits do all the acting in the raunchy sex scene ten minutes of endless re run shots of her bouncing on top of some bloke all in all and summed up as one don t bother just don t,0
3517,this movie is so mild i tried not to expect anything greater from this film but still it was a big disappointment the basic idea of the story is interesting and potential this could have been so much better the characters are really simple no depth at all it s a shame that previously talented performers tiina lymi and petteri summanen didn t make the already poor characters any better the director just don t get the watcher emotionally involved at all with this piece of cr p and the the chase sequence at the end of the movie that s hideous why there had to be so stupid and old solution for that situation it s too much used element with even more terrible way of filming it oh no,0
1899,the movie heart of darkness is an insult to the book by joseph conrad to be quite honest the movie made me want to fall asleep on the other hand the book was definitely extraordinary i feel that the movie left out several key elements and missed some of the main points from the book in addition the actors were boring and lacked originality and enthusiasm the book while not an adventure story or easy to understand is full of hidden meaning and interesting twists in the plot the book though very confusing and complex is astonishing when you do finally understand it you feel as if you have actually learned something the novella or short story had several key ideas like futility and craziness which the movie left out in addition several key scenes were changed which in return affected the entire plot many of the scenes seemed to be very choppy in the sense that they did not fit together in summary the movie seemed to be a bad interpretation of the book i would only recommend watching this movie if you cannot picture or understand the book but otherwise i would skip this one it was dreadful and in complete disarray if you have never read the book then definitely do not watch the movie because you need the basic information from the book to understand the movie the movie was a horrible spin off of an outstanding and detailed book,0
4611,holy crap the beginning picked up where the first one left off good start then it goes downhill from there you it looked like as if you were watching tv and you keep on switching between this teenage soap opera a predator movie and some crappy detective show the characters that are introduced in the first ten minutes don t have anything to do with each other until the final 45 minutes or so the characters of the teenage soap opera and the actual alien story then for the end the producers were quickly running out of money and decided to end the movie so they decided to drop a nuke on the city p s what the crap is the deal with the cameras being so zoomed in you can t tell what s going on seriously movie makers do a good job with fight scenes and make it to where we can see the fight,0
10757,because that s what hell ride pretty much is larry bishop and tarantino partying on the weinstein s money with the promise to deliver a movie sometime down the line i m all for fake boobage and booze as much as the next guy but did we really need the movie really there s nothing worse than the reheated second hand leftovers of an old trend and i m not even talking about 70 s grindhouse cinema because hell ride has none of the raw and unpolished feel of the era it purports to pay homage to no this is slick and glossy mtv hollywood through and through the old trend i m talking about is the self consciously pseudo hip quirky cinematic world where tarantino meets guy ritchie and robert rodriguez all three guys were at least talented and found success for a reason hell ride is just a second hand copy fickle and uninspired polished to the max when it should be raw the supercool aspect coming off forced and silly there s no reason for example why such a simple and utterly inane story has to be told in convoluted back and forth in time fashion it s just a post tarantino quirk there s also no reason why the dialogues have to be so mind numbingly pointless people flapping their gums while saying nothing at least when travolta was talking about cheeseburgers in pulp fiction it felt fresh dialogues here amount to little more than pseudo macho posturing there s also no reason why a grating rock n roll guitar has to twangle aimlessly over the entire movie perhaps the lowest hell ride hits is when it tries to be quasi existential there s a hilarious dream illusion scene in the desert where bishop eats peyote and sees colours i was half expecting an old indian to come out and offer nuggets of wisdom the only saving grace of this abysmal turd is the boobage and vinnie jones monologue about his wings tattooes and maybe some of the desert exterior shots lots of boobage and hot scantily clad babes now that s something i can get behind but a movie they don t make everything else is just an empty shell an imitation of other infinitely more talented imitators,0
16014,taking its cues from backwoods classics deliverance and the texas chain saw massacre jeff lieberman s just before dawn might not offer much very new in terms of plot a maniac stalks and kills a group of campers but still manages to be an effective shocker thanks to the director s deft handling of the material great use of the stunning scenery even greater use of women in hot pants a brooding synth score from brad fiedel and a nifty twist towards the end although one that should be apparent to those who have been paying attention thanks to solid performances from its capable cast including oscar winner george kennedy as forest ranger roy mclean there is a sense of realism to just before dawn that is all too often missing from this kind of fare the film also offers a pretty creepy maniac who sniggers like dick dastardly s dog mutley and uses a nasty serrated machete to kill and delivers a couple of very imaginative sequences which help lift it above many of its contemporaries a topless woman gratuitous nudity box well and truly ticked in a lake discovers that the hand that has been groping her underwater doesn t belong to her boyfriend and a shortsighted character makes out with his pal s girlfriend as a joke unaware that the person who is slowly approaching is not his friend but the killer,1
18462,admittedly there are some scenes in this movie that seem a little unrealistic the ravishing woman first panics and then only a few minutes later she starts kissing the young lad while the old guy is right next to her but as the film goes along we learn that she is a little volatile girl or slut and that partly explains her behavior the cinematography of this movie is well done we get to see the elevator from almost every angle and perspective and some of those images and scenes really raise the tension g tz george plays his character well a wannabe hot shot getting old and being overpowered by young men like the jaennicke character wolfgang kieling who i admired in hitchcock s the torn curtain delivers a great performance that although he doesn t say much he is by far the best actor in this play one critic complained about how unrealistic the film was and that in a real case of emergency nothing would really happen but then again how realistic are films such as mission impossible or phone booth given the fact that we are talking about a movie here and that in a movie you always have to deal with some scenes that aren t very likely to occur in real life you can still enjoy this movie it s a lot better than many things that i see on german tv these days and i think that the vintage 80 s style added something to this film,1
3343,i love how everyone treats this show like it was the next great american sitcom i watched five episodes of this abomination and the only person that came close to an actual teacher was the old guy that sort of loved and hated his job the rest of them were just pretty people trying to read the lines written by people who never actually went inside of a real classroom i loved how every episode consisted of the two idiots one who got laid and the other who didn t getting into some form of zany trouble that indirectly involved their students the british girl who thought she found an likable quality in the main idiot but in the end was somehow shocked that he turned out to be a jackass the hot chick that was there for the particular purpose of being hot and the principal and her lackey that served to somehow move the almost non existent plot forward i loved how almost all the teachers on this show were very young but i ask you to think back to your high school days and remember the teachers that you had did they look like that or did you go to the high school that had middle aged people teaching in it that is the high school that everyone else went to the show lacked any form of research into what goes on in schools in public schools principals do not have the power to higher and fire teachers the school board does but in every episode that i watched the principal made threats to fire her teachers think back to your history class or think of any history class did you ever see an incredibly hot british chick teach an american history class no did you ever see a teacher s lounge that is so huge that you could actually play basketball in no teachers could have been a great show had it actually of based itself in some form of reality what makes teaching funny is the stories that you get from interaction with students and the teachers find it funny because they deal with the students day in and day out the overemphasis on their lives outside of teaching just made it another four camera sitcom that had unrealistic people in an unrealistic environment saying unrealistic lines and i m sorry i just didn t buy it the show could have modeled itself after other currently successful sitcoms and used a single camera format and it should have centered more around the teacher s relationships with their students and not with each other it gets a star for trying and a star for the hot chick she was really hot in the end it was a failed sitcom that will go down in history as a hacks attempt to understand a profession i only hope that if they make another sitcom based on teaching that they learn from their mistakes so that a monstrosity such as this never touches the television screen,0
10748,in what attempts to be a positive story dolph lundgren leads a group of mercenaries to take over a tropical island that looks a lot like paradise so that the men who hired his team can mine it for bird droppings actually the nitrogen gas that exudes from the muck on this island is what they are after there was only one good thing about this movie the island location in which it was filmed was beautiful otherwise the story drowns itself leaving the actors with nothing to work with result a lot of violence a lot of language lots of blood and a few shots of women topless if you want pointless violence sorry the storyline can t even give the violence a point though it tries then this is the movie for you parents be warned that this movie is full of violence and blood driving the r rating,0
24530,i love this movie and i recommend it to anybody damian chapa and jennifer tilly played their roles perfectly just the characters alone pull you in to the movie the directing was also magnificent the most creative shots i ve ever seen i was stuck to the screen throughout the whole movie not one scene was slow the movie also has a lot of action packed scenes cars blowing up etc the movie is just an all around masterpiece if you like real entertaining movies then watch this because you ll be on the edge of your seat the whole time i put this movie on my top ten all time list because there is never a dull moment in the movie and that is my type of movie 2 thumbs up all the way up,1
15327,i mean let s face it all you have to do in modelling is pose for photos the judging is so over the top with it s criticism the show however is entertaining especially with tyra banks nigel barker j alexander and the supermodel herself twiggy i ve watched season 5 6 7 and in the middle of season 8 it looks like american idol gone sexy but i m a guy and i only watch it because of the hot girls posing in their bikinis the show can be quite boring when it comes to judging tyra tends to go on and on and it s really off putting anyway would i recommend it yes would i recommend it to women wanting to go into the modelling business no,1
13386,i wasn t expecting much out of this movie and i was slapped in the face julie walters rupert grint and laura linney perform wonderfully as the main characters in this movie any teenager can relate to parental control and the urge to come out as who you really are which is basically what this movie is about ben rupert grint does this when he meets retired actress evie julie walters and begins to express his ideas with words he slowly but surely breaks out of his shell and becomes much less awkward each and every viewer feels the ups and downs of the movie and the theatre is filled with laughter 75 of the time the film satisfies all and i hope that soon it might be released in all us theatres because many do not have the chance to see the film unless they live in big cities it is a must see,1
7869,ugh stephen baldwin i never noticed until i got the dvd home and saw his name in the credits double ugh what s worse he s the name in this low budget mindless wandering wannabe shoot em up i mean where did they find the guy to write this refuse driving a caterpillar in the la city dump while hoping to break into the movie game the whole plot is ridiculous situation piled on ridiculous premise baldwin is as convincing as a poster boy for american gothic sans pitchfork his whole acting repertoire is looking like he needs the potty and then looking like he found it so there you have it folks bad script bad acting by no name actors low budget setting and a hero that s about as convincing as a girl scout looking for a cookie customer as an action hero it s too late for me to get my money back on the dvd but you can spare yourself unless you re one of those who likes to look at the dogs for a laugh frankly this one is too boring to be funny,0
14240,one of the most successful shows in television history is back now i admit i never got into the original show okay so i never watched it at all but the new show is impressive sci fi has premiered the first two episodes rose and the end of the world this weekend we meet rose a twenty something clerk who is chased by remote controlled mannequins she is rescued by a mysterious stranger who calls himself the doctor using the internet she finds a conspiracy buff who warns her that wherever the doctor goes death follows when her geeky boyfriend mickey is replaced by an impostor the doctor informs her of a plot to use earth as a breeding ground for more of these plastic monsters whom the doctor has been fighting across space and time traveling in a tardis disguised a 50s style police call box she helps him save the world there wouldn t be a show otherwise and decides to join him but when he puts her life in danger he is distraught and questions whether her company was worth the risk although the special effects are kinda lame and the some of the scenes are a bit choppy doctor who is after two episodes aired in the us a smart well written work apparently the second season has already aired in the uk so i predict the same success here,1
15026,emilio estevez actually directed a good movie who woulda thought i sat through two previous films estevez directed wisdom with then girlfriend demi moore and men at work with brother charlie sheen they are lousy films badly acted directed stupid and offensive estevez is a good actor but lousy as a director i turned this on in pure curiousity it has a great cast and i had nothing else to do damned if it didn t pull me in it concerns estevez coming home from vietnam permanently scarred by what happened over there his parents kathy bates martin sheen and sister kimberly williams try to reach him but can t something in vietnam has affected him deeply and he s about to explode a bit overlong but still very good a lot of the material is familar but the cast is so good that they make it seem new estevez is good sheen is terrific and estevezs real life father williams is touching and bates is just extraordinary trying to hold the family together it all leads up to a powerful ending which really surprised me well worth catching,1
20359,though i saw this movie about 4 years ago long before i started commenting on imdb i decided to review it now which is unusual for me since before now i often reviewed something just after seeing it what can i say well the best performance is that of the late peter boyle as the title character who after finding out about a man s killing the drug dealing boyfriend of his daughter wants to bond with him even though he s a madison avenue executive who has nothing in common with the very lower class conservative joe in fact there are plenty of funny scenes of joe at this guy s party making smart alecky remarks there oh and it should be noted that the actress that plays the daughter who they re looking for after she disappeared from the hospital after overdosing on some drugs is none other than susan sarandon making her film debut this was a pretty hard hitting movie for the time it was made late 60s early 70s and was compelling work from scripter norman wexler later of saturday night fever and director john g avildsen later to do save the tiger rocky and the karate kid certainly the ending packs a wallop even today after all these years highly recommended for anyone curious about the counterculture of that time p s among the cultural artifacts seen here are a raggedy ann doll a box of ritz crackers a bottle of heinz ketchup and unique for the era a nixon poster asking would you buy a used car from this man,1
16476,like some people here i love loved stingers in norway it got aired a lot later that also means that we are in the 176th episode yea that s right i have to say that i really love stingers it can make me cry laugh smile and so on i think i m going to die the day we reach episode number 192 stingers might be the on series except from grey s anatomy that i really watch the actors are amazing especially jacinta stapleton personallly i think she is one of the best access we have i know he is not like super known but she is really a great actress stingers makes me want to be a cop i love it p s do you know if you can buy the episodes,1
10852,i rented this movie because the cover was cool looking the first 15 minutes of the movie are okay and somehow interesting but once the young woman and her little sister go on their trip everything goes to hell and the movie becomes boring,0

23806,the most attractive factor that lies in this masterpiece of a film is not the beautiful lead actors it isn t their outstanding acting and sizzling chemistry either to me it is the mis en scene of the entire movie the settings the lighting the props all add to the mood for love between the main characters a whiff of smoke from chow s cigarette tells us his state of mind the ever changing tight fitting cheongsams of lizhen reflects the constraints of decision making the ruins of angkor wat ties in with the deteriorating relationship of the two leads the excellent use of mis en scene gives the film just the right amount of feel needed to flesh out the complicated nature of the characters relationship the film leaves the audience fruitlessly yearning for more,1
9685,over acted heavy handed full of speeches preachy on the nose and over stylized in a way only mtv could be guilty of stop loss is agit prop garbage i expected a lot more with talented young actors such as joseph gordon levitt and ryan philippe but screenwriter director kimberly peirce does a hatchet job of portraying the ill effects of war on american youth i m sure she did some work researching the iraq war and the young men fighting in it but you d never guess it from watching stop loss in many ways this mess reminded me of catherine hardwicke s lords of dogtown an equally inept overly stylized tv movie like waste of solid subject matter http eattheblinds blogspot com,0
17496,this movie brings back so many memories for me i was very young when it came out but i remember the first time i saw it my dad and i would always watch the ernest movies together we hadn t seen any of them in several years and i found a couple of them really cheap we watched them and could not stop laughing i love all of the ernest movies but this one is my favorite spoiler part the part i remember most is the magnet part my dad still does the electric chair scene end spoiler this is a very cheesy movie but a great one it s perfect for families it isn t like a lot of the trash out there but at the same time adults can laugh too if you like physical humor like facial expressions and the way people move then this is the movie for you,1
953,this 3 hour made for tv miniseries came home with us from blockbuster s this weekend the production company clearly spent a lot of money on sets costuming bridget fonda especially and special effects including a great jim henson talking polar bear reindeer they should have spent a bit more money getting a coherent script the story line was so loose that it really never came together one can overlook irish accented germans but not herky jerky storytelling with senseless loose ends which included a special guest appearance by the devil this one is certainly not destined to be a christmas classic a shame that they wasted good performances by the two female leads,0
17766,when wallace and gromit burst onto the scene in their academy award winning short a grand day out they created a fresh new look at claymation after two more shorts aardman s dynamic duo returned for this thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining movie it has an excellent voice cast humorous jokes and good animation as only aardman could do in this movie wallace and gromit run anti pesto a rabbit removal company when word gets out about a were rabbit eating all the vegetables in town a frenzy ensues of course victor quartermaine the town s handsome toupee brandishing huntsman wants to get his hands on the rabbit to impress the lovely lady tottington but can our favorite aardman duo save the day before chaos ensues the jokes i should say were hilarious one point the villain victor quartermaine s booty crack was showing prompting a character to cry out beware the moon vintage aardman the characters are crisp and hilarious our favorite aardman team of man and dog entertains us as only they could do earning them their second oscar remember a grand day out helena bonham carter was terrific as the lovely lady tottington wallace s love interest ralph fiennes was especially funny and foreboding as the cunning toupee wearing hunter victor quartermaine but the one who really stole the show was the priest whose antics proved to be some hilarious comic relief hats off to aardman for creating another wallace and gromit masterpiece,1
15705,this working girls go to hell soap is a time capsule candidate courtesy of its immaculate physical production 50s costuming look at all those bows and pearls creamy johnny mathis theme song and oh so daring for its time sexual attitudes rona jaffe s novel on which the film was based keeps on being republished and just a few years ago vanity fair actually devoted an article to this delectable bon bon of a movie take a look at the new dvd transfer and you ll know why the three leads hope lange diane baker and suzy parker echo the girls from how to marry a millonaire or carrie bradshaw and her friends from sex and the city gentlewomen songsters off on a spree their romantic adventures and sexual entanglements are the stuff of paperback passion empty caramel corn calories devoid of nutrition impossible to resist snacking on lange is genuinely touching in her neo grace kelly way baker is properly dim and idealistic as a timid virgin who gets gasp knocked up by a hiss cad it helps that the cad is played by robert evans the throaty voiced coke snorting film mogul who surely has lead many an innocent young lamb to the slaughter in his beverly hills bedroom suzy parker is fascinating in the first half of the film all blithe self assurance and knowing remarks she struts her stuff with the panache of the fashion icon she was in the 50s alas she s not up to where the film sends her into madness and obsession but she exudes glamour and savior faire and her acting is at least adequate one wonders why the critics loathed her virtually driving her out of movies a few years later perhaps an aloof attitude on the part of a good looking woman is just too much to bear it sank ali mcgraw s career a generation later and when you think of it ali mcgraw and suzy parker were basically the same actress the film s only major flaw is a weak ending it pretty much collapses into a romantic swoon at the end rather than rising to a wham bang melodramatic finish like the other famous soap opera from producer jerry wald peyton place which had lana turner weeping and gnashing her teeth during a rape trial here hope lange wanders out onto the new york sidewalk spots burly eternally hung over but now of course sober stephen boyd and they simply walk off together into the sunset one presumes otherwise this is pretty much the definition of a guilty pleasure oh yes there s also joan crawford breathing fire at all the young girls and smoking cigarettes while she hisses to her married lover over the phone and the titles are done in hot pink with ribbon lettering that recalls the department store ads of the late 50s don t miss,1
11653,i guess my biggest mistake was to watch this remake of 95 piranha back to back with joe dante s 78 original i did the same last week with the omen curiously enough watching the remake right after the 76 original really made me appreciate the 2006 version quite a bit for various reasons but this approach sort of backfired on the 95 piranha version it enhanced the fact that it really is a lesser picture basically the 95 version is more or less the exact same film as it tells the same story and follows it practically scene by scene only barabara steele s character and the military intervention were written out of it but the cinematography wasn t as good the acting was worse too especially alexandra paul playing heather menzies character showed me again what a horrible actress she is bradford dillman from the 78 version had his charlton heston way of acting going which was amusing while in the 95 version william katt does a good job at being william katt so i didn t mind him really but the whole cast is pretty much inferior and the only worthwhile event was spotting james karen return of the living dead parts 1 2 in a cameo john carl buechler s make up effects aren t as neat as rob bottin s the musical score had some ring to it but pino donaggio s score was much more memorable in the original so all these shortcomings really shone through with having just re watched the original as part of this double bill since scott p levy s remake does follow dante s original i guess it is entertaining enough to sit through though it s lacking the wit dante s original had but what really made me not like levy s version very much is the fact that quite a bit of stock footage from the first film was re used during the piranha attack scenes i never like it when filmmakers do this and i m not talking about using footage for flashbacks or other valid reasons i mean if you don t have the budget or imagination to come up with newly shot material then for pete s sake don t do a frickin remake but roger corman produced this cheaper remake so i guess i shouldn t be all that surprised about the re use of footage if you do decide to watch piranha then make sure it s been a while since you ve seen the original you might enjoy this remake a little more then and oh yes that cool little stop motion creature from the original is nowhere to be found in this film as to be expected but what s worse there also isn t any female nudity in this one the original really had quite some titty shots going for it and that blonde girl from the opening scene even accidentally pulled her underwear a bit down too far when removing her jeans figures as this 95 version was made for tv,0

24386,alice is the kind of movie they made in the 30 s and 40 s never attempts to be an event just wants to entertain and it does i was surprised by kiefer sutherland in a role that could be a cliche he made it real the plot does make allusions to alice in wonderland a guy dressed in white does go through a hole and kiefer does fall down one like alice the plot does twist and turn but with a freshness you don t see in small movies i loved the direction sutherland just a very fast paced and interesting movie,1
19108,i was one of the lucky people to be invited to view this film in new york it is a compelling story of how a group of extremely tight friends dealt with the tragedy of september 11th this film made me laugh and cry and showed me how the human spirit through love and friendship can endure and create wonderful things out of one of our darkest days the film makers truly captured the emotions of the individuals involved it was amazing to see how the same story was told through the eyes of so many different people i walked out of the theater that day wanting to call all my friends just to say hello i would recommend everyone see this documentary i would rate this movie with an a see it if you get a chance,1
16291,mark blankfield from the old late night tv show fridays plays dr daniel jekyll a mild mannered surgeon who invents a powder that turns him into a drug crazed party animal this was not of course his intent he had higher aspirations but he goes with the flow this is actually a fairly stupid movie but it s also pretty fun of course once the good doctor realizes what he s done he s ashamed but he s also not above doing it all again running through hollywood as a crazed sex machine with frizzed out hair gold chains there s a few subplots like jekyll s fianc e who is the daughter of the head doctor at our lady of suffering and pain jekyll s employer and there s tim thomerson as a plastic surgeon with seemingly few real parts and a taste for men and a rich old man whose situation is a parody of howard hughes and who is going to make several people rich with a complete set of organ transplants including testicles yeah the humor is raunchy and silly and overall the whole thing is fairly tasteless but if you re not above a quick wallow in the gutter you ll probably like it just fine now available on dvd too for the first time woohoo 7 out of 10,1
1460,one of those movies where you take bets on who will die first and who will survive at the end there was just something about the movie that made me zone out i think because i keep looking back and thinking yep still in that tree still looking at the water poor character development i felt nothing when they were in danger i was voting for the croc i found it hard to believe a croc would try to tip a boat in the first place and then when it jumps into the boat i find that really unlikely as well the croc seems too supernatural at times all knowing all seeing also when the croc attacks it s behavior seems very unrealistic it s a killing machine and wouldn t be letting victims escape twice to three times in a row especially when attacking in the water,0
15510,this show was not only great human drama but portrayed racism in this country in a raw all too true to life manner when one show can be so witty and entertaining and yet so poignant and educational all at once this is television in its highest form the acting was phenomenal the writing was exceptional not only did the show portray race relations in a straightforward manner that seems unmatched by any other television series but its ability to depict this subject matter as it existed in the 1960 s alongside how it exists in the beginning of the twenty first century powerfully demonstrates the ways we have changed and sadly the many more ways we have not,1
11620,this film actually starts out pretty interesting but for my taste it degenerated far too quickly into a dull and predictable melodrama none of the performances are particularly interesting and the camera work is just standard tv movie stuff so there s really no reason for anyone to see this movie unless they are as big of a jeff bridges fan as i am i guess bridges plays mike olson a young man who announces at a family picnic that he is quitting college to go on the road his parents believe he is just acting out and talk about how he has no plan he assures them he does have a plan and that he needs to discover his true self and his place in the world so much so in fact that he invites them to go on the road with him and purchases an antique bus to travel in which he and his father repair in true tv movie father son bonding fashion up until about this point in the film i was somewhat interested in the plot and characters and i wanted to see how his stuck up mother vera miles was going to react to life on the road there s a funny scene early on where the father and son have to convince her to take the trip with them they show her the inside of the bus and she gradually becomes more and more interested finally departing in a huff with some kind of talk about curtains versus blinds on the windows bridges marvels to his dad carl betz equipped with radio announcer voice that she has changed her mind dad assures him electric oven works every time but the movie goes downhill almost as soon as they hit the road it turns out that mike s only plan is to introduce them to some friends of his who turn out to be random people who they meet at a hippie rock festival as soon as i saw the rock festival i was a bit disappointed particularly as it became obvious that the entire rest of the film would take place at the festival campground and not actually on the road but at least i thought there might be a decent band like well if they couldn t afford hendrix or the stones maybe they would at least have canned heat or little feat or something like that no dice apparently the only music at this festival is some horrible choral group with orchestra that sounded like a poor imitation of the fifth dimension coupled with an annoying announcer who s supposed to be humorous also we are introduced to a set of hippy festivalgoers and their various medical melodramas kathy renne jarrett is a pretty blonde girl with existentialism and nature on her mind who falls in love with mike before revealing the fact that she needs kidney dialysis to live and has run off to the festival to die and 2 other campers are determined to have a baby in their crude tent introducing the struggle between modern medicine and hippy ignorance or something like that all in all the longer this goes on the more painful the film becomes for anyone hoping for any element of surprise or real drama basically this movie is a waste of time although it would probably amuse anyone who is really into the period of time in the late 60s early 70s and the films from that time i d be just as happy if i never see it again though,0
20635,it was a fun film to look at though the chance this happened in your street is small there are still a lot off recognizable situations that will ring a bell the simplicity of the film and the humour do work i must admit that you don t have to see it in a theater it will do very well on a small tv set tip see it with some close friends,1
23288,the bbc surpassed themselves with the boundaries they crossed with tipping the velvet in the past they ve been daring with dennis potter s works but this mini series as it was screened in the uk is superb andrew davies work is top notch i ve not read the sarah water s novel but i can imagine he s done it real justice i comment on the bawdiness most men have watched it for that proved to be a main talking and selling point when originally advertised the fact is it portays the lesbian side of society in the 1800s a time when most thought it was old men and rent boys well it was lesbianism took place mainly behind closed and often respectable doors you can also look at tipping the velvet as a love story it actually is as well as self discovery that many gay bi and straight people go through and comments on this occur and repeat all the time if you ve not seen it yet either repeated on tv or on dvd get it you ll be in for a treat and even the production and filming of it is perfect just try to hide your blushes in parts like i said bawdy is the order of the day and beware a phallus or two enjoy,1
13409,hehehe this was one of the best funny road movies ever i laughed so i fell out of the chair with many norwegian and foreign celebrities playing themselves harald zwart is the producer known for films like agent cody banks and of course one night at mccool s it is about norwegian crazy fans going to the world cup in soccer in germany 2006 and all sort of crazy fun that comes with it it was hilarious i couldn t stop laughing i haven t had so much fun in ages rumors say it will come a number two but i do not know it will be hard beating this one recommended to everyone it is a must see film i was suppose to see it at the cinema but i had work at the times it where shown and been trying to rent it for a month but all the time rented out got it today on dvd well worth it,1
14280,or vice versa this is a french film noir directed by an american film maker jules dassin who had to leave the country because of being blacklisted by hollywood thanks to huac the premise of the story is rather familiar one last jewel heist for tony le stephanois and his buds and so is the ending with everybody getting well no spoilers here for sure since this is the sort of film in which tension toward the ending is important dassin filmed in realistic lighting in black and white on the streets of paris using actors and actresses who are not glamorous the engaging sometimes intruding score by georges auric nicely enhances the movie and will remind viewers of many a similar score from american film noirs from the forties and early fifties jean servais plays the hardcore consumptive lead in a fedora much as humphrey bogart might have played him tony s recently out of prison past his prime but still tough and decisive when he has to be his mind still sharp when focused the kind of anti hero whose eyes water even though the tears will never fall dassin plays the italian safecracker and would be ladies man who knows the rules but gets careless in film noir we are forced by the logic and focus of the film to identify with the bad guys often there are levels of bad guys the good bad guys we are identifying with and the bad bad guys who are out to do in our good bad guys and then maybe there s a really bad bad bad guy or two here we have remi grutter played by robert hossein a slightly sadistic druggie then there are the cops who are irrelevant or nearly so in more modern film noir the bad guys are not even good bad guys and they get away with it or something close to that in the old film noir which evolved from the gangster films of the thirties the usual motto following the old hollywood code was crime doesn t pay with every criminal having to pay for his or her crime before the end of the movie probably the most impressive feature of rififi is how nicely the film moves along the plot unfolds quickly and seamlessly much the way the great film directors always did it directors like stanley kubrick louis malle and the best of hitchcock some have actually compared this to kubrick s the killing 1956 and suggest that kubrick stole a little well directors always steal if need be and there are some perhaps telling similarities such as it being one last heist for the protagonist and having the girl gum up the works the similarities may go deeper because as this film was nearing its end i suddenly thought oh no the suitcase in the back seat is going to fly out of the convertible hit the ground burst open and all the money is going to fly into the air those of you who have seen the killing may recall what happened to the money near the end of the film which reminds me of another film with something bad happening to the money oliver stone s u turn 1997 starring sean penn there the money in his backpack gets blown to smithereens by a shotgun blast ha ha ha getting the dubbed version of this film would be an act of sacrilege since the dialogue when there is some the heist itself is done entirely without dialogue about 30 minutes worth is terse and easy to follow requiring only an occasional glance at the subtitles which by the way are quite utilitarian and guiding as opposed to having every word spelled out one other thing all the brutality is done as sex used to be done in film that is off camera a guy gets his throat slit we don t see it i kind of like this approach we don t have to see the gore you could almost let your kids see rififi almost catch this one now and be on the lookout for a hollywood reprise starring al pacino and directed by harold becker coming out next year in which you can be sure that the violent scenes will be played out in full,1
15441,i love to see a female protagonist in this movie her name was rose rose brought out a lot of interesting questions in her journey of fulfillment is is possible to attain peace and internal fulfillment through external means does our society teach this can one be a victim of memory which may lead to victimizing others is one responsible for being a product of one s environment to what extent can one control or take control of one s environment how is a typical human alike or different than rose lastly would the outcome or story change if it were from another country like france or italy i loved that this movie provoked all of these questions in me while it entertained stimulated and kept me guessing to the end every time i ve watched it i have learned more about the film and myself,1
4846,this entry doesn t contain a spoiler it doesn t have to the movie is as predictable as the sunrise the element in the first alien movies was the suspense that something could happen this was so in the first two predator movies though less prevalent requiem has totally removed the element of suspense and replaced it with blood and gore you know people are going to die well duh it is a avsp movie but you know who is going to die and when they are going to die and where they are going to die before it happens the directors should take a lesson from hitchcock who said suspense is not a time bomb going off under a table suspense is a bomb not going off under the table what s the sense in going to a movie when you know exactly what is going to happen and when if you really really want to watch this movie wait until it comes out on video and then rent it but by no means would i ever buy it,0
6233,big disappointment clash by night is much to talky and stagy and the dialog doesn t resonate as true coming from these characters this is melodrama at its peak the acting is truly over the top and very unreal only marilyn monroe and keith andes as supporting players give this film any zip wish they had more to do i m somebody who looks at details in films two big questions 1 who is watching the baby the entire day when stanwyck and ryan are together and douglas is working then breaking up a fight in a bar with is father 2 when stanwyck is packing to leave town why is she seen packing at her brothers place where she hasn t lived for at least two years also when everyone goes to the projection room at the theatre who s taking care of the baby again such details really irritate me and cause me to give films much lower ratings what were the writers directors and everyone else connected with the film thinking nuf said,0
9337,the movie that would be included if mystery science theater 3000 had a home game version the source material for tacky comments in this movie are endless i found the video of terror in the jungle at a garage sale what a find,0
20653,with the nazi rise to power in eastern europe in the late 1930 s charles chaplin turned his attention to creating a reaction to it the catalyst may well have been a propaganda publication referring to chaplin as a jewish sympathizer in the great dictator chaplin created a dead on parody of hitler that is as funny as it is frightening at times the film traces hitler s experiences in the german army from world war i up to the present day simultaneously chaplin plays a jewish barber who dresses like the tramp who comes out of a hospital after a long long time only to discover how different the world is under nazi rule paulette goddard chaplin s wife at the time plays a young jewish girl whose family is oppressed in a jewish ghetto jack oakie has a great oscar nominated supporting role as a mussolini look alike benzini napaloni who gives chaplin s hitler character adenoid hynkel a lot of fits henry daniell is his usual staid self as garbitsch chief adviser to adenoid hynkel chaplin wrote and directed the film and received oscar nominations for his screenplay and his acting the film was also nominated for best picture chaplin made the film under tremendous pressure for some obvious reasons and some not so well known he financed the entire film himself at great risk because of the subject matter and there were no other major films made regarding nazi germany up to that time the film spent about twenty one months in production with chaplin even rebuilding a set and re shooting a scene to get things right by the time of the film s release in october of 1940 the war in europe was well under way with hitler conquering one country after another so the film became much more topical at its release than when production first began there isn t much plot in looking at the film in retrospect the film seems more like a series of comedy sketches and or mishaps strung together to get to a purpose independent of the film itself several examples of this occur in the last third of the film with the meeting between hynkel and napaloni the scene is very very funny but it leads no where in terms of the plot likewise the escape of both the barber and schultz simply leads to the mistaken identity of the barber for hynkel in order to give chaplin through the barber character an opportunity to pontificate to the audience at the end of the film on the other hand what better way to make a point about the misplaced narcissism of aryan superiority than to have a jewish barber mistaken for hynkel still the film contains many high comic moments such as the rally speech the new war developments bulletproof uniforms etc the dancing globe scene the coin in the pudding scene and the entire scenario between hynkel and napaloni including the barber chair scene to highly recommend the film one can also not forget the risks chaplin took in making his first talking film an anti nazi film and financing the film himself 1 2 of 4 stars,1
18268,i was blown away when i saw the best years of our lives the acting script and master william wyler s direction winner of best director in 1946 is brilliant the film is about three world war ii veteran s who come home together on a plane and all by chance live in the same town they all are reunited with their families the first man al stephenson played by fredric march in his oscar winning role has to adapt to his wife millie played by myrna loy and children peggy and rob played by teresa wright and michael hall being different than before he left for the war the second man fred derry played by dana andrews in an excellant role has to find a good job and adapt to a wife he had only been married to 20 days before he left for the war he begins to find out that she is not the same the third man has a much more harder adaptation to make homer parish played by harold russell in his excellant oscar role he has lost his hands in the war and must deal with his family s and fiance wilma s played by cathy o donnell reactions to the hooks he has instead of his hands all of these men and their families are reunited in the film in different scences the stories of these men are all interwoven beautifully together this film truly defines the meaning of a classic this unforgettable drama winner of best picture in 1946 is a film that everyone should see if i was asked to pick a favorite film i would pick this one out of 10 i would give the best years of our lives an 11 so the next time you rent a movie rent this one you won t regret it,1
12771,has aged really well still thrilling and suspenseful today certainly one of hitch s best movies beautifully shot with a great premise for suspense sex appeal provided by beautiful ruth roman because of the great premise you feel like you have to watch it to the end if you find yourself losing faith in hitch and doubting his title as the master of suspense i recommend this nice little movie as an antidote 5 out of 5,1
7777,oh man where to even begin dropping your gun to get in hand to hand combat w a zombie while holding a bitten soldier down debating to shoot him b4 he turns then he turns and bites the person holding him down turning your back on a fallen zombie continuously shooting the chest and seeing it doesn t work so they shoot the chest some more having the idea that a kid slumped at a desk w blood coming out of his mouth is still alright walking along a football field like nothing is wrong then all the sudden noticing the zombie football team doing whatever in the middle of the field like they couldn t have been seen up to that point i could go one for a few more hours but you get the point childish writing and dialog bad directing horrid special effects truly sad and undeveloped storyline zombie infested campus must get the viral host then lose it twice the only plus i can find is that this one doesn t include clips of the actual game during the action scenes id say don t waste your money but id be more upset about the waste of time i saw it on cable and wanted the 2 hours of my life back,0
7215,yep edward g gives us a retro view of the criminal defense world first he s an overzealous prosecutor who sends the wrong man to the chair played passionately albeit briefly by deforrest kelly then he s so filled with remorse his only solace is the bottle throw in a jaded romance a genuinely rapid descent into penury and no qualms about who he defends and next thing you know shazam black leg lawyer god i love that phrase he sees the light just in time to save his jaded beloved from the chair yawn but really the courtroom action is pure melodrama see him punch out a witness see him drink poison see him argue passionately as he clutches a bullet hole in his breast be prepared for melodrama the hoot of the film though is jayne russell with curves defying the laws of gravity and an iq approached absolute zero she is something to see even sings a bit,0
14788,i saw this version about a decade ago and have been looking for it ever since i just recently found an original vhs version and purchased it for 125 00 sounds crazy but if you like me consider it as one of the best the broadway musical stage has ever produced you wouldn t even think twice why it s just a little over paying for a broadway ticket today i really hope they re release this in dvd form soon it s a piece of musical theater that screams to be seen by all,1
21992,how often do you see a film of any kind that has a talent show with refreshments waldo s last stand is a refreshment here waldo is selling lemonade but isn t making any money alfalfa spanky darla mickey and buckwheat come to visit him which is ironic because in both 3 men in a tub and came the brawn where there was competition between alfalfa and waldo for darla s affection back to the story the gang taste the lemonade to see if waldo made it right one funny moment is when alfalfa gets a glass cup for lemonade and waldo fills is and gives it to darla and alfalfa has an angry expression on his face spanky proposes a floor show to go with the lemonade and even mickey agrees ever so cute when the floor show begins there is no one at the barn but then a customer comes in froggy spanky asks him if he wants lemonade but all he does is nod no spanky asks him numbers of time in the short and every time froggy nods no spanky displays many expressions on his face which is funny spanky tries many ways to make him thirsty one way is when after mickey said ever so cutely those crackers are salty and they made me thirsty there is also many entertain musical bit is this short the opening number is by darla which she tap dances and sings the second includes alfalfa singing off key as usually with mickey leonard spanky and buckwheat about how dry i am i believe they sing that to make froggy thirsty it also made me laugh the closing number includes boys and girls all dressed up in an old fashion way this was waldo s last our gang short a grand musical short that is a pure 10 out of 10,1
18321,this show has everything you could ever want from a prison drama there are twists and turns all the way till the season finally the characters are very strong and it gives the show a lot of power when watching the show you feel for not only the prisoners but the prison staff the actors who play prisoners on this show have done a very good job portraying a prisoner also if you like law and order svu or law and order criminal intent there are many actors from this show that appear in those shows the only problem with oz is that it was not long enough this show could of easily had nine to ten seasons without getting old even after the season finale i sill find myself watching oz all the time on dvd this show is easily one of the best shows on television don t be a fool go watch oz,1
24851,pistol packing pam grier takes names and kicks butt as the heroine in asylum of satan director william girdler s entertaining blaxploitation actioneer sheba baby co starring d urville martin and austin stoker sheba baby is one of several tough chick flicks that grier appeared in during the 1970s including coffy foxy brown and friday foster the short lived girdler co wrote this thoroughly routine private eye potboiler with producer david shelton in one night and it features a headstrong female shamus that refuses to rely on a man to help her take care of business unfortunately sheba baby isn t nearly as good as the blaxploitation movies that grier made under the supervision of director jack hill hill helmed the african american north carolina native in coffy foxy brown the big bird cage and the big doll house anybody that analyzes images of african american women in cinema should be familiar with these epics the chief problem with sheba baby is that our heroine gets too many convenient breaks naturally the secondary villains are trigger happy clowns that couldn t hit the side of a barn with a howitzer as the main antagonist dick merrifield qualifies as both an egotistical as well as smarmy villain with choice lines like anything worth having is worth stealing additionally composer monk huggins does provide a strong atmospheric orchestral soundtrack and the best song with barbara mason warbling it is good man is gone sheba baby casts grier as stylist chicago gumshoe sheba shayne she leaves the windy city to return to her hometown of louisville kentucky to help out her father when she arrives in louisville sheba learns that her father andy rudy challenger of detroit 9000 is having trouble with a local black gangster nicknamed pilot cigar chomping d urville martin of hammer who demands that andy sell out his loan company to pilot or die initially pilot dispatches a goon squad to trash andy s office but our heroine s father catches them in the act they turn sheba s father into a punching bag interestingly during the fight scene girdler rarely shows fists smashing flesh earlier andy s right hand man brick williams austin stoker of horror high had sent sheba a telegram requesting that she return to louisville but she didn t receive it immediately thanks to her lazy partner who didn t know where to find her brick and sheba hook up rekindle their romantic flames and share a night in the sack brick spends most of his time urging sheba to remain calm in the face of adversity as a former louisville kentucky police woman sheba prefers to shoot first and ask questions second after she arrives home sheba borrows her father s car and barely escapes being blown to bits as she is walking out the door to get into her father s car andy receives another harassing call from pilot previously andy had refused to discuss the prospect of selling his loan company to pilot but andy changes his mind and agrees to talk with the hoodlum a gratified pilot warns andy about the dynamite that has been attached to his ignition with a delayed action fuse in other words cranking up the car won t trigger the explosion the explosion comes ten seconds later andy and brick rescue sheba before the car blows up earlier sheba had agreed to let her father handle his problems without her interference dad i know you think i m doing a man s job but i m not going to sit on the sidelines just because i m a woman sheba tells him after her near death experience sheba vows to learn who sabotaged her father s car she grilles an old contact from her days as a cop and threatens the guy with her gun to extract the information only after sheba has ground the guy s face into a bucket of chlorine dust does he relent and tell her about a pay off at the town s railroad museum brick accompanies sheba and shooting ensues with a flustered pilot getting away by the skin of his chin later pilot sends a quintet of out of town contract thugs armed to the teeth to trash andy s office these gunsels ignore their no kill orders not only do they shoot the loan company office to ribbons but they also blast sheba s dad with a shotgun sheba retaliates in short order wielding her nickel plated revolver she guns down three of the four assailants dirty harry style the last hit man discards his weapon and pleads for mercy sheba has her finger on the trigger when homicide detective phil jackson charles kissinger of abby and a uniform cop arrive on the scene at the hospital andy shayne dies holding his daughter s hand naturally pilot is furious at this revelation and his fury borders on apoplexy afterward sheba tracks down a loan shark walker christopher joy of cleopatra jones and pries information out of him about the pilot while she holds him at gunpoint in a car wash this is one of the better staged scenes with lots of ominous shots of the car wash equipment whirling and humming walker warns pilot about sheba pilot and his henchmen confront sheba in a parking lot and swap lead sheba flees on foot to a nearby carnival while the police corner one of pilot s men she deals with the others pilot shoots one of his own accidentally and sheba runs him down she pins pilot to a roller coaster track and threatens to hold him there until the roller coaster cuts his head off pilot manages to escape after he has spilled his guts to sheba about the identity and phone number of the big man shark dick merrifield of the hellcats whose reputation is so immaculate that detective jackson describes him as the guy with all the right answers sheba baby isn t top notch pam grier however the idea that our heroine can handle everything by herself without help from guys makes it interesting as well as entertaining chick flick,1
15382,so the wwe has done it they have poured over into film their first one being see no evil starring their very own kane i caught this movie and went in not expecting it to be a great film it just seemed to clich and looked like nothing new to my surprise it actually wasn t half bad a viewer stated above that it is good b horror movie fun and honestly thats the best way to describe it now the question i was asking myself was how was kane going to hold up well let s just say he made an absolute bad ass out of the jacob goodnight character he sold the role really well and really did look menacing but what can you expect from someone who is almost 7 feet tall and weighs around 320 in solid muscle the acting was decent and the story was nothing new of course but we all know that the directing as well as the cinematography was done very well and the hotel backdrop really looked dilapidated and well done considering this was directed by a porn movie director i was quite surprised i d recommend this movie if you re looking for mindless gore and killing and just some overall fun think of this movie as a modern day latter friday the 13th film and save room for the ending too cuz it s a good one and stick around after the credits too,1
13449,spoiler warningwe ve all heard the boy who cried wolf legend but what if the wolf was a person in the modern world well it might be something like big fat liar fourteen year old jason sheperd frankie muniz from malcolm in the middle is always lying to keep himself out of trouble one day he is pressured to write an english essay but it winds up in the hands of sleazy film maker marty wolf paul giamatti who plans to turn jason s story into a hollywood blockbuster no one believes jason when he for once tells the truth and he ends up in summer school however jason is determined to prove to his parents the truth and travels to l a with his friend kaylee amanda bynes when wolf refuses to admit he ripped off his story jason plans to make wolf s life a living hell b f l is no masterpiece but it s a nice way to spend 90 minutes of you re time i wished they could ve made it a bit longer though and there aren t that much pranks although they are clever enough i like the pool dye the best i might not have liked this as much as i do if it weren t for paul giamatti he is simply hilarious in this if you have 90 minutes to kill try this out you might just enjoy it,1
2048,this excruciatingly boring and unfunny movie made me think that chaplin was the real hitler as only someone as evil as him could torture people with this tripe i saw this movie remastered which only made the suffering inflicted by this atrocity more severe this movie is nothing but a pathetic repetitive movie which instead of inducing two hours of laughter it induced two hours of suicidal urges after the first 10 minutes of this i began wishing that gas would start seeping from the speakers of the theatre if i could give it a zero out of ten i would happily do so avoid at all costs,0
15424,this is a luminously photographed and unusually well written western by veteran creator of rawhide charles marquis warren direcxtor gordon douglas is its chief help in this regard its strong plot line can be told in a few sentences a hard nosed by the book cavalry officer captain richard lance captures a leader of the indian enemy after a massacre at a fort he insists on bringing the man back for trial to be sent totucson his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner for trial and the patrol is wiped out this means the leader has escaped and lance must now lead a second patrol and he picks the men the fort can most spare a company of problems to defend the advance fort that had been wiped out and save the command from another attack by stopping up the bottleneck pass in that sector as lance young gregory peck is quite strong other in the large cast of this film which really shows life at a cavalry outpost looking like an army establishment of heterogeneous and quarreling types includes war bond powerful as a hard drinking sergeant neville brand and steve brodie as troublemakers warner anderson and lon chaney jr as psychological troublemakers and gig young art baker herbert heyes as fellow officers with nana bryant as the colonel s wife even barbara payton as the love interest gets by in a difficult role michael ansara is the captured war chief and jeff corey plays the fort s scout there are really two great scenes in this very well made western the long section at the fort before the last patrol is sent out and that long patrol to the doomed ft defiant itself once at that fort peck gets to deliver a grand speech in which at the demand of the men he has lined up for orders he tells them each why he took them along reading them their shortcomings one by one they then tell them why they think he sent his best friend to die in his place take the indian in instead of going himself and he proves them wrong for the remainder of the film by winning his lonely battle through intelligence and courage the music by franz waxman is good the production qualities admirable the argument about what would happen if lance takes the war chief in happens to be true other than this unsolvable mistake by the central character this is is great western it has been a favorite of mine for fifty years,1
14841,i loved this film independent film making at its best the cinematography pacing rhythm and acting were perfectly in sync fred carpenters best work to date the movie is well written with lots of plot twists that take you to a great ending it moves well and keeps you involved being a photographer i was most impressed with the cinematography the lighting creates mood and a beauty that is usually found in a much bigger budget film this gave the actors a great canvas to start from to work their magic and that is just what they did great performances from all the actors and each one was well cast in their roles as i said in the beginning the is a wonderful film and one of fred carpenters best movies you will love it,1
8905,we rented the movie and it maybe the worst movie ever the box they had in the video store had a cool looking monster on the cover but in reality the monster was a creature from the black lagoon mask awful awful awful you actually might have to rent it it s so bad it feels like you are watching a bizzare o home movie,0
17154,i remember watching this series avidly every saturday evening it was the highlight of the week i loved everything about it the location the costumes the actors and the wonderful music by clannad i still have their legend album i loved the way they solved the problem of michael praed leaving by creating another robin this time the earl of huntingdon i believe there were legends of several robins in medieval times another thing i loved was the fact that it was filled with young actors i m sure robin and his men would have young after all people didn t live that long in those days other robins always look too old kevin costner with his ridiculous accent looked like robin s granddad the only sad thing was the ending it s a shame they couldn t at least have done a one off special to tie up all the loose ends and give it a happier ending,1
15864,where this movies differs from traditional hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings in europe for example we ve had years of war and though one nation could never eradicate the other the old enemies always ended living next to each other or with each other at the end of the conflict in the us the immigrants white population exterminated the aboriginal population to near extinction the us citizen never had to live with its enemy this explains in my view the often simplistic nature of hollywood movie when they try and explain a foreign country s strife but in this movie the director and screenplay did not fall into this clich it turns out everyone in the story has some right and some wrong it s a great story of morality hidden truth and compromise,1
1828,i appear to be in the minority on this one but i found one true thing to be schmaltzy contrived and generally unpleasant not that the acting was all that bad but the characters seemed little more than archetypes the bad father oh but wait maybe he s not unredeemably bad maybe there can be a resolution at the end admittedly the woman i was with loved the movie so maybe you ll like it but i didn t,0
18407,i guess i have to write something here although i think my one summary says it all i m not a huge ted danson fan nothing against the man just hasn t done it for me this covers the sides of swift s novel that were never covered before you can tell the cast was having a wonderful time filming this,1
876,this is my first review on imdb com and probably first ever written review of a film i ve done of my own accord not for some class assignment i think that fact alone says something about this movie not a good thing i am no seasoned journalist or critic though i have seen my fair share of movies but i found this particular film so terribly painful to watch it was necessary for my own peace of mind to vent about the experience where better to do it than imdb as i forced myself to sit through the movie physically writhing from the inability to connect the dots i was sure there would be some light at the end of the tunnel a revelation to explain what in samhe ll was going on the movie ended and i was as enlightened as dog after several rewinds to review certain scenes i still could conclude nothing sensible i found myself wanting to yell does this make sense to anybody i would recommend to not waste your time but then again if i were you i d probably want to experience it myself if that s the case bring a crossword puzzle or something so you don t get bored,0
23658,this has to be one of the best and most useful shows on tv keys to the v i p demonstrates some of the best seduction techniques and the humor that goes along with the techniques that are not up to par to the person who wrote the negative comment i only have one thing to say stop hating on us because we are better looking and have more game then you have you ever seen the inside of a club or do you just watch it on tv and your so called female friend she is not attracted to us because if guys like me saw her in the club we would just walk right by and talk to the hot girls like the ones on the show stop hating watch keys to the v i p and improve your game,1
19696,is the princess bride meets well trainspotting but wait really it s a good combination this was definitely one of the better movies i ve seen in a long time it has the kind of witty dialog i associate with the princess bride or cemetery man along with the disgusting scenes of violence of a horror movie the heroic feel of princess bride combined with the this is odd lack of any really good guys that trainspotting had i m not saying it was as good as the princess bride but it was in the arena and it rocked some of the dialog transcends pleasing to brilliant the plot is interesting the characters while slightly anacronistic are anacronistic not due to their intrinsic nature there were flamboyantly gay people in the 18th century contrary to a previous reviewer s remarks but just in a bit of the language they used the anachronisms made it fun though and not cheesy and easily dismissed if you ve ever read any simon r green or gleen cook s garrett series you know exactly what this movie is check it out it s great,1
7560,my take the silliest of the airport movies and probably one of the worst of the 70 s disaster movies as if to milk the franchise with all its got the producers of this third sequel to airport throws in more action silly subplots gratuitous star appearances and goofier elements in its attempt to be the biggest airport yet concorde airport 79 is the worst one yet and probably one of the worst of the disaster movies of the 1970 s with its bad box office results it is no wonder that the genre has overstayed its welcome the film opens with a rather catchy score by lalo schifrin backed up by some impressive shots of the titular aircraft in its former glory the same plane used in this film would be involved in a crash in july 2000 but then the credits appear and we get a glimpse of the all star cast which is composed nothing more of faded hollywood stars tv actors and none too popular b actors the plot is sillier than ever george kennedy is back in the role of joe patroni now the pilot of the concorde co piloted by co pilot alain delon en route to france after the summer olympics on board is reporter maggie whelan susan blakely who has just discovered that his boyfriend renowned weapons manufacturer kevin harrison robert wagner is selling their weapons to terrorist to prevent her from revealing the news to the world harrison sends his most advance missiles and best saboteurs to prevent the concorde from landing the cast subplots are dumber than ever even sillier than an alcoholic myrna loy or a singing nun we have cicely tyson transporting a live human heart in a cooler martha raye as a woman with a bladder condition and the character doesn t go deeper than that j j walker a a pot smoking saxophonist arguably the most annoying character in the film eddie albert married to old wife sybil danning avery schreiber as russian coach with a deaf daughter and finally a love story between reporter jon davidson and gymnast andrea marcovici much to the sour watching eye of coach mercedes mccambidge plus the movie gets much closer to love boat episode than ever with the silliest cameos of charo and her pet chihuahua and bibi anderson camp buffs will no doubt get a real kick in the balls in this silly entry in a long strain of 70 s disaster movies this one is in more than the sense of the word a true disaster rating 1 2 out of 5,0
5256,there really are no redeeming factors about this show to put it simply its just terrible absolutely dreadful it s just a dreadful reality show not only that it s dreadful fiction imagine this a bunch of overly imaginative teenagers get together one night and go hey let s make a paranormal show just like ghost hunters and whatnot so they grab a camera harass local residents and film random landscapes behind a painfully trying to be dramatic yet failing misreably monologue this show is basically a bunch of teenagers running around with a home movie camera trying to make a really bad horror documentary the only difference is this show actually has a budget and writers a wasted budget and terrible writers oh the problems how do i count thee well first off let s talk about this from a personal level i am not a total skeptic when it comes to the paranormal i am willing to believe in whats paranormal and whats not and i m sure there are a lot of people who feel the same so if you re going to do a show about the paranormal you have to do a good job convincing the viewer that what they re seeing is either paranormal or not because the viewer can easily believe otherwise i hate to compare but i don t see why not at this point take ghost hunters for example in ghost hunters you can tell that the cast is leveled with the audience they re not totally skeptical yet they re still willing to keep the possibility of any paranormal anomalies in mind they have to look at something and be willing to say this is possible that its simply nothing and with that in mind they set out to try and prove themselves wrong they use technology and several other gadgets along with constant moderation to determine what is paranormal along with bearing the fact that what they may be monitoring could be nothing in mind not only are they trying to convince themselves what is real and what is not in the process they are trying to convince you that element of doubt is not present in paranormal state strike one in paranormal state the cast simply says there s this spooky place and its haunted so we re going to find some spirits and immediately you know and saying to yourself okay convince me otherwise the cast is not professional in their interviews in fact sometimes it seems like they re just harassing local residents of these so called haunted areas they have no real evidence to back up their claims besides assumptions and theories and the best they can must up is somebody who claims they can contact the dead with no one ever backing up who this person is and how valid they really are they could have easily just picked some random person off the street and said pretend you can contact spirits for our show and went at it in the mothman episode this just happens without any convincing evidence towards the end of the show they bring this sort of individual out where he does a random painfully scripted reading of a supposed area of how something is haunted in order to convince its audience very very poor effort i feel that one of the main problems with the show is that it feels scripted during one of the episodes the cast gets attacked by one of these paranormal anomalies at times in an attempt to be dramatic these sort of dramatic sequences would make any skeptic laugh and even those who are on the fence realize what they re watching is just a bunch of tabloid esquire trash if the show s aim was to try and convince their audience that these paranormal events are real they re doing a horrifically poor job at doing so strike two however there is always the counter just one last viewpoint to see if the show is actually worth something what if the show isn t trying to convince you that these paranormal events are real and are simply trying to entertain you with good fiction it even fails on that level as well if the show s creators were trying to craft fiction to entertain its audience the writing is too poor and even on a fictional level it fails to convince the audience that its cast members are really experiencing the unknown in all its full horrifying glory the writing is simply not compelling and even dare i say boring strike three so what remains of this show is simply a bunch of teenagers who are too willing or too gullible to believe in the paranormal simply because its simply much more amazing than reality who set out with a camera a bad script and bad actors to generally just make a really bad horror documentary thats all the show is at this point there is no reason to see it not even for the entertainment factor and there s no reason to care about it to be blunt its lame there are absolutely no redeeming factors about this show,0
14556,i m a sucker for a decent superhero movie i m not counting super bug budget no storyline batman s either a couple of my favorites are the phantom and a budget movie called the demolitionist the black scorpion can be added to that collection if you ve seen the demolitionist then get this movie it s basically a copy of that heroine it even stars the same guy in both movies if you haven t then let me explain a cop s father is murdered and she seeks vengeance she laces up the black outfit a sexy catwomanish skimpy outfit that looks absolutely great on joan severance and goes out to kick some booty it s a fun action packed movie mind you you may not wish the kids to see it without screening it first to see if you approve of the pretty graphic sex scene severance has in it which in my opinion was a bonus alright give it an extra star,1

19819,this is better then the first the movie opens up with sheriff sam then sam and anne pack there bags up and head to the tropicana while jack tags along people are shot get glass through necks get squished by anvils get stabbed with icicles eyes gouged out head explosions drownings hangings lobsters shoved into faces slit throats freezing to death killed by snowballs arms are ripped off melted by anti freeze icicles down necks hit in face with pots and pans fingers getting bitten off icicles through mouths bitten on the neck exploding people toasted snowballs and shoved in blenders the snowballs are hilarious they put it into a blender and turn it on then it says that was fun they put in in a waffle thing and it gets burnt this is just a great movie then they start thinking of other ways to kill it and the snowball replies that s not nice it was worth then ten bucks spent to buy this 10 out of 10 stars,1
5122,good technomusic accompanying medieval swordplay also the movie looks sleeker than most b movies but let s face it quake or doom has more atmosphere bad unintelligent plot no acting and totally unbelievable universe i am usually able to see the potential of even very bad movies heck i love a good b movie like split second and the likes but this one has has nothing but boredom and clich to offer totally predictable from start to end oh and i forgot the lousy special effects they look more like an old playstation game than anything out of myth the use of a classic poem to sell this sucker offends me conclusion quite simply boring if you want to see lara croft buy the game it s way sexier,0
22901,this is one of the finest movies i have ever seen the stark scenery the isolation the ignorant bigoted people hiding behind their religion a backdrop for some wordliness and sophistication the acting is completely natural but for me as a foodie the best is the actual choosing and preparation of the feast i have spent time in paris and know the cuisine well whether or not the cafe anglais really exists i don t know but i do know of similar establishments and babette s menu and choice of wines are authentic and of course the end where despite themselves the perfect meal mellows them back to friendship is the only ending there could be this is a 10 out of 10 film and should be seen by anyone with enough brain and taste to understand it,1
2806,a female ex cop who was drummed out of the force for recklessness and who could probably beat chuck norris in a fight hires herself out as a private bodyguard her first client is a worthless playboy type it takes half the movie for her to get kicked off the force in the first place lots of great fight choreography but the plot is strictly by the numbers and the acting is as wooden as the dialogue give this one a miss,0
16728,charles bronson is back in his most famous role in my opinion this is by far the best film of the series and my favorite movie ever this movie doesn t take itself seriously because the filmmakers knew that all the social commentary that was necessary was put across in the first film golan and globus made this film for bronson fans not for the critics and it works dw3 has been unfairly criticized as trash and a weary entry in a worn out series these statements would be true if the film was made to be taken seriously or to spread a statement but it wasn t if you take it as what it is dw3 is just a fun action packed romp with charlie doing to street punks what we all wish we could do the action is non stop the atmosphere is great and the movie is just out and out the best bronson flick ever made you can tell that the penny pinching cannon group spent a lot of money on this one it is believed that bronson thought this film was too violent and that was the reason why winner didn t direct any of the following entries i can understand his concern but as is always the case of sequels you have to push the envelope even further to pass a previous entry in any case this movie was no more violent than any other movie made during this time what makes dw3 the best of the series and my favorite film ever not the best just my favorite is the action charlie s presence memorable villains and it s ability to get the viewers to jump on the bandwagon the first film may be the most technically well made but this one is the most fun for once charlie actually has some clever lines although he doesn t say much and a halfway interesting story photography action and direction to back him up charlie has never been more intense or super cool than in this one yes it s exploitive maybe it does promote stereotypes and maybe it is the same story as before but bronson s films always have and always will stand for defending the common man and giving his audience what they want to see many argue that the dw series manipulates its audience my reply is that the movies don t manipulate us the fans are the ones in charge we demand that bronson blow away deserving scum and in turn winner and co deliver the goods and for those of you who still want to put it down remember a few things dw3 was the 1 movie in america when it came out and was among the viewing favorites of millions of people on video and television because they realize that not all films have to be epics they just have to be fun 10 you can t get any better john batchelor,1
24790,i know that chill wills usually played lovable old sorts in westerns but his role in this segment is something i ve remembered for a long time wills could be a first rate villain yes burgess meredith s fall was correct that look in hepplewhite s eye it expressed porcine greed ignorance and the threat of violence all at once quite a performance i think the segment itself was a good one too question couldn t the little black bag cure alcoholism i guess it did sort of with fall but the doctor would have been wise to apply the cure if he had it as quickly as possible to hepplewhite there is one moment that was annoying but also necessary and it is something that appears to recur in these night gallery segments it s serling s constant need to sermonize for that s what we got one more time with dr fall i don t know what was more frustrating losing the black bag and all its miracles or not being to stop fall from preaching about the bag s benefit for humanity all while rubbing hepplewhite s greedy face in the mud and therefore all but begging for hepplewhite to strike out at him but as i say it was necessary at least it was for me otherwise we wouldn t have been able to see wills performance discussed above all done without moving a muscle or speaking a word,1
17203,still funny after all these years midnight madness is good entertainment for all ages it introduces michael j fox as a typical 15 year old trouble maker melio and blaylak are by far the funniest characters in it and leon is perfectly cast as a wierdo game master the budding romance between adam and the girl couldn t have been any cheesier fagabeefe,1
22648,here s another of the 1940 s westerns that i watch whenever it comes on tcm or fmc because although it may be flawed historically it is extremely entertaining and well acted plus it s got randolph scott my favorite actor second only to gary cooper well ok fourth behind coop charlton heston and gregory peck but the film itself to me anyway is reasonably historically accurate and as i said before well acted and flows very well i bet i ve seen it 50 or 60 times and enjoy each viewing more than the one before i have it on tape from tcm but would buy it in a minute if it ever came out on dvd see it if you haven t i guarantee you ll like it,1
5997,it was praised to be a fast paced screwball comedy and the best german movie of the year so i gave it a try even though i ve already seen some films by dani levy or at least parts of them i got what i had expected no comedy at all unless you think that heart attacks are funny it s a fine example of sloppy screen writing with an implausible plot and characters loaded with clich s that might be true but surely are not funny either the most annoying character is that of zucker s wife played by hannelore elsner she has to behave incredibly strange to keep the plot moving for example she doesn t know a single thing about judaism but by reasons most likely unknown to even herself she gets the idea to play the charade that she and her family are jewish laws obeying jews for her husband s family who really are and of the very orthodox and self righteous variety to make it a bit more complicated she invites the four of them to stay at her city flat because they arrive from frankfurt in berlin without having booked their hotels in advance something no 60 years old business man actually no grown up german would ever do this gives the viewer a lot to swallow but still fails to produce any jokes zucker and his brother samuel haven t seen each other for forty years but it turns out that his daughter now a lesbian and samuel s son now a militant orthodox were once lovers and he s her daughter s father samuel s daughter a nympho goes after zucker s gay son is this supposed to be a somehow humorous parody of jewish incestuous tendencies probably it s just a thoughtless way to add some love action turbulence every screwball comedy needs and of course is also fails to produce any jokes the praise for this movie is purely political therefore only people who enjoy watching movies that are supposed to be politically important will enjoy this one even though alles auf zucker quite clearly has no importance of any kind for all the rest don t watch it without a fast forward option i really missed it,0
6819,yes said title line does actually appear in this movie why i m not sure when the line was actually being said didn t somebody in the crew filming at some point laugh i would have liked to see the outtakes from this movie mostly because i think they would be more entertaining than the movie itself helmed by director jim gillespie i know what you did last summer comes a teen slasher movie that seems to assume we haven t ever seen a teen slasher movie before of course he s not to be given all the blame there are also three writers responsible and this is somehow based on a video game that s still in production the title of said game is backwater but upon looking for information on it i came up with absolutely nothing and so we begin the movie i would like to say before i continue that i wasn t expecting this to win an oscar when i am in the right mindset i enjoy a fun horror movie to pass the time i think there exists an opportunity for an effective original and smart slasher movie venom is not this movie there is almost no character development at all that s fine you don t expect a whole lot however instead of a well knit cast of a few this movie decides to introduce us to the following many horror movie clich characters 1 the final girl she has just broken up for her boyfriend this means that at some point in the movie when they are in peril they will decide to get back together again which more than likely means he will die and she will be the last remaining survivor of the movie eden is played by agnes bruckner without much enthusiasm i might add 2 the boyfriend he s just around to co exist with the final girl until his demise sure he can save her but he s doomed and we know it eric is played by jonathan jackson 3 the bimbos usually horror movies only feel the need for one of these but here we have two they shoplift they steal they might show their breasts not in this case or they might possibly be alcoholics a staple of the genre they also wander around in dimly lit areas all on their lonesome usually saying things like hello is there anybody there tammy and patty suitably named are played by bijou phillips and davetta sherwood 4 the jackass sure he looks pretty but he s the idiot in the movie that s inserted purely to be an idiot he says stupid things does stupid things has obviously never seen a horror movie and is one of enjoyable kills you watch this kind of thing for sean is played by d j cotrona 5 the girlfriend she loves the jackass even though pretty much nobody else does and she s usually the one left alive for a while so she can scream and cry until she starts tripping and gets left behind rachel is played by laura ramsey 6 the creepy janitor in this case the creepy gas station attendant enough said ray is played by rick cramer i could continue but i think you get the picture the remaining characters aren t so much common as they are equally killable there s the gay guy pawel szajda as ricky who definitely got robbed as far as screen time is concerned and the one who knows what s going on of course none of that matters because at first everyone always thinks that one s crazy cece is played by meagan good there are a couple other characters namely a deputy played by method man but he and others are killed off pretty quickly and get even less character development than the following clich s so you re probably thinking why does this movie require such a deep analysis it s just a summer horror flick for cryin out loud based on that question does it deliver the goods yes and no the acting isn t particularly convincing even given the amount of talent involved bijou phillips was hailed for her performance in larry clark s bully and agnes bruckner has been an up and coming talent for a while now so what about the gore there s some that s really about it a lot of the juiciest bits are cut aways namely a scene involving somebody s face and a sandblaster used to remove paint from cars to the filmmaker s credit there are a couple interesting scenes i liked the bit where part of a house was literally ripped off so that the unstoppable villain could get to the characters if this had all been centered around a smarter screenplay in which the characters didn t make the same dumb mistakes literally hundreds of horror movie characters had made before them it might have made for a more enjoyable experience all of the most interesting characters are immediately killed off in the first third of the movie and then it just becomes a not particularly interesting countdown until we know it s just the creepy janitor and the final girl i suppose i must be a little jaded but as a horror film fan i m left wondering why i should have bothered when i could easily have written a better screenplay myself i won t even mention the numerous instances of terrible cgi,0
3170,do not watch this movie or if you are really mad at anyone you can give this as a birthdaypresent this is the worst movies i have ever seen do not watch this if you do remember that would be a self destructive action it is a shame that this is not voted lower,0
17791,simply delightful claymation feature from nick park and company spoofing such film greats as king kong and the wolf man has wallace and gromit as rabbit security finding it difficult to solve a major problem in their village a giant were rabbit is feasting lavishly on the vegetable crops of the citizens what makes this even worse is that the great vegetable festival is about to commence and the citizens have all prepared dutifully to win the top of prize what makes the situation even worse is wallace is the reason behind the whole vegetable eating rampage he was testing out a new invention regarding taking his brain waves in an attempt to brain wash captured rabbits into disliking vegetable crops what occurs is catastrophic as some sort of hybrid were rabbit is created in the process and it has more to do with wallace than he could ever imagine it ll be up to his loyal and startlingly intelligent and fast thinking dog gromit to save the day this is a clever and imaginative effort from the crew behind other oscar winning claymation features starring wallace and gromit seeing good ole fashioned claymation is refreshing considering the cgi boom that has featured rather lackluster fare here recently as the industry spits out more and more mediocre product here we get a full feature with witty humor and some wild stunts featuring marvelous animation not to mention gut busting sight gags,1
20602,if you ve got a box of tissues a comfy couch a large bowl of popcorn and no social commitment on a friday night this is definitely your movie its romantic its hot and its challenging for most of us gay people religion is just one of those things that we did when we were kids and probably just starred at the alter boy and how cute he was but in latter days you see the struggles of being gay when your entire world revolves around belief s which totally contradict being gay the two main cast members were totally hot but at the same time managed to capture your heart and even make me almost cry i have never cried in a movie which i thought was quite impressive for a b grade movie i highly recommend this flick you will laugh you will cry unless your me and you will definitely drool i love it so much i even purchased the dvd for my collection its truly the most beautiful movie ever,1
22531,i had seen this movie before but i could not remember it was this fantastic it has a fun plot madonna fumbles around the city with pumas etc causing a commotion and the music is just perfect and the happy ending who s that girl is a great choice for a romanticist like me in my opinion this could be even the best madonna movie i have ever seen 10 10,1
1841,i don t know why imdb lists all the ghoulies films as theatrical releases they were all straight to video films same with the puppet master series why hasn t anyone noticed this yet right somehow you ve stumbled across ghoulies iv probably raiding through an old abandoned video rental store from 1993 you looked in the discount section and found this look at the back and front covers what do you expect the shawshank redemption there is no need to review this film so critically it is the fourth ghoulies film i bought it on dvd for 6 50 because it was 6 50 i knew it wasn t kubrick material and i was right an unremastered dvd with no extras not even a trailer boasts an uncared for film it actually contains the star of the first ghoulies film peter liapis who really didn t get many big roles apart from those two films and i don t see why he s not too bad an actor and is pretty fun but i guess if you re gonna take a lead role in the ghoulies films scorsese and tarantino will lose interest also present is his idiot sidekick bobby di cocco who despite having a very small resemblance to al pacino very small retains none of his acting ability a complete idiot who s just awkward to watch then there s stacie randall obviously a porn star i don t need to look that up she does look quite sexy though her costume her character and everything she does drags down the films credibility which is no easy task for such a film then there is the ghoulies themselves who also manage to let us down ghoulies iii made them start talking mistake no 1 but ghoulies iv takes it a step further instead of being puppets this time the ghoulies are in fact kids in costumes the filmmakers decided to run that extra mile to insult the films viewers also there s only two of them and they re not the main highlight of the film as they don t appear in a lot of it however at times they are mildly amusing and they re not evil this time either this really is hilariously bad stuff it s amazing that i was actually able to enjoy it i dunno why some of the black humour is actually funny though the script is mostly effortless imagine satan s only threat to you being that he will kill you slowly painfully but at least full moon had no involvement this time did they yeah a very bad and cheaply made film with 0 production value but not so bad as to be in the ranks of puppet master 1 2 lawnmower man 2 surviving christmas or even ghoulies iii,0
5126,i ve seen this movie during a festival here in munich with a huge crowd of real fantasy fans at about the middle of the movie one part of the audience was sleeping and the other part was booeing boring dialogues badly choreographed fighting sequences a terribly dumb story and even worse special effects well at least the actors hadn t much to do except for looking concerned or in case they were female showing their breasts in the right light even g tz otto who was among the audience admitted afterwards that ge could understand the disappointment of the viewers be warned folks of the cheapest fantasy movie ever,0
10230,i cant go for long describing this tittle simply because i do not feel strong about it i read a few comments and i see that only proud and patriotic frenchmen seem to like it that s all i can say boring long sometimes even stupid p s 7 4 out of 10 the viewers must be going crazyi cant go for long describing this tittle simply because i do not feel strong about it i read a few comments and i see that only proud and patriotic frenchmen seem to like it that s all i can say boring long sometimes even stupid p s 7 4 out of 10 the viewers must be going crazy,0
10267,i am currently 22 years old and remember seeing this movie in the theatres when it first came out you heard me right i was 5 years old and yet i can still distinctly remember what i saw that afternoon so many years ago was it a mystical trip through the fantastic world of mark twain s creativity no on the other hand it was a quite creepy film about mark twain s dark depressed and in fact suicidal side one scene that still bothers me was a particularly strange scene in which mark twain is playing the organ at his own funeral would an adult enjoy this film well this movie quite possibly features some interesting viewpoints that a person with a working knowledge of mark twain s writing might enjoy but trust me on this adventures is not the film you want to use to introduce your young children to mark twain,0
9888,not to be confused with the 1943 george zucco movie the mad ghoul the mad monster is a film that zucco appeared in the year before in this fairly paint by numbers affair zucco perfects a way to turn his dim witted handyman petro into a wolf man hybrid by means of wolf s blood injections and then wastes little time in sending the transformed doofus to slay the former colleagues who had scoffed at his experiments it is a very simple plot really and an extremely low budget production glenn strange who plays the man wolf here would soon achieve greater fame playing the franky monster in films such as house of frankenstein 1944 and abbott and costello meet frankenstein 1948 the makeup job on him here is pretty lame and only succeeds in making him look like a hippy with bad teeth like the one in 1957 s teenage monster the sets in this film in addition are fairly nonexistent and the denouement is abrupt and unconvincing i have given the movie a very generous 4 stars in part because i have an abiding love for 1940s horror films but truth to tell most objective viewers would probably deem it laughable crap and i suppose it is it s certainly no well crafted universal affair or val lewton masterpiece that s for sure still zucco is always fun to watch even in undemanding piffle such as this if you can spare 72 minutes of your life i suppose you could do worse than the mad monster not too much worse of course oh one other thing this dvd is from alpha video and you know what that means fuzzy images lousy sound indeed the worst sound of any alpha video dvd i ve encountered so far and no extras you ve been warned,0
2872,yet again not quite bad enough to make it enjoyable in fact this one is just boring it s reasonably well made even though the script is bad the effects are ok and the acting average apart from james mason who is always great but in this one underused i suppose it is hard to write anything about this film because it didn t evoke any reaction in me what so ever dull dull dull dull dull,0
3368,this movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in the vcr or dvd player michael dudikoff and lisa howard are two bounty hunters in love yet they are total opposites she is ambitious and organized while he is laid back and totally scatter brained in this movie bad guys are chasing jersey bellini dudikoff s character this opens the door to bad godfather impressions ludicrous fight scenes and tony curtis playing the most effeminate looking mob boss i have ever seen the ending has to be the most unbelievable scene i have seen in a movie in quite some time i would believe the terminator even the matrix has a better chance of possibly being true than this ending this movie just reeks of cheapness the script had to have hit someone as being totally ridiculous yet the green light was given for this piece of dung to be made and let loose on on unsuspecting public i watched this movie with several other people who all agreed that we had been cheated no one in the group could say anything good about the film except that it was over,0
8795,having sat and watched this film i can only wonder at the reasons for creating the film this was without a doubt one of the worst films i ve ever seen and had no redeeming features if it was supposed to be funny then it might have managed to be a very weak comedy but as an action thriller it was dire slow no plot no real action nothing approaching good dialogue and i ve no idea about the characters what else can i say avoid,0
17986,a throwback to the old fashioned westerns of the 30s and 40s such as dodge city dallas has a number of things going for it gary cooper at his coolest blazing technicolor photography by ernest haller gone with the wind and a pulse pounding max steiner king kong gwtw dodge city et al score in addition there is a masquerade mistaken identity a faked death and more hair breath escapes than a republic serial as always cooper defines what it is to be a man under pressure forget the 50s angst western this is pure entertainment,1
20262,this is a nice movie with good performances by paz vega and leonardo sbaraglia of course vicente aranda is a legend in spanish cinema and surely one of the great directors in spanish cinema but i don t think this is one of his greatest movies even if it s fine the screenplay plays with the introduction of merime as a character it s a nice touch but it s unbelievable the music is composed by jose nieto national spanish prize in cinema i mean this movie is very good in all the technical aspects there are very good actors in supporting roles like antonio dechent maria botto and others i give it 7 out of 10 cause i think this could be a better movie but as it is it is not boring at all,1
10002,worst pile of drivel to date everyone involved with this production should be ashamed of themselves not one single element of the movie was anything slightly like an original idea a first grader telling you a story about nap time is more entertaining,0
10161,i thought i was going to see a ufo movie instead i saw a movie that was trying to make the audience me make the decision to accept christ in my life or risk going to hell the whole ufo thing was one big red herring the acting in it was pretty pathetic in fact it looked as though some people from an evangelic church just got got together and decided they wanted to make a movie all the characters talked as though they were in church conversing with other church members it wasn t real life dialog at all i wish i had read some reviews before seeing this movie so i wouldn t have wasted my money on it if on the other hand you are into the whole church scene in a big way and want to see a demonstration of how to push your views no matter how limiting onto other people then by all means go see it,0
8152,black dragons is a second feature wwii propaganda film popular at the time it s not as bad as some would have you believe a secret meeting hosted by the respected dr william saunders george pembroke is interrupted by a mysterious stranger names monsieur colomb bela lugosi shortly thereafter the participants at the meeting begin to turn up murdered their bodies being placed on the steps of the japanese embassy in washington colomb is suspected federal agent dick martin clayton moore is assigned to the case and meets saunders niece alice saunders joan barclay who tries to assist him the reasons behind colomb s actions are not explained until the final reel until all is explained at the end the story is hard to comprehend lugosi who had by this time been reduced to appearing in a string of low budget quickies is actually quite good in this one he is not allowed to over act as much as he ususlly did and credit for this has to go to director william nigh lugosi s character slinks through the shadows and is reminiscent of his dracula even to the point of the full close ups of his piercing eyes clayton moore a one dimensional actor at best would become tv s lone ranger in a few years joan barclay makes a good heroine although a little dated now black dragons is not a bad way to spend an hour,0
16087,much about this movie was beautiful the acting the scenery and without a doubt aaron s cinematography background showed through on the beautiful shots definitely worth watching as your attention will be captivated the entire time and it ends on just the right note the acting by newcomer jonathan furr was superb as one would think he was a pro acting since he was born he has gone on to act in other feature films but this starring role will always be remembered the film does have that academy award feel to it at times where it s slow and scenic and quiet so it s not a movie that a d d kids can sit through however the rustic feel of east bend and yadkinville played out well as a 1940 s era film,1
13259,i found this movie on netflix and had to add it to my queue i wasn t disappointed when i got it as it s just as funny now as when i saw it at a local drive in theater back then it builds to a climax nicely with you getting glimpses of the various characters as they begin their trip across america on the honky tonk freeway america on wheels this was a strange comedic role for william devane as i remember him as kennedy in the 1974 tv film the missiles of october and felt no one could have pulled that dramatic character off as well as he did it reminds me a bit of dick van dyke in cold turkey where van dyke played the local minister devane s role as mayor minister and activist was typical for small towns so it makes his character seem amusing and real howard hessman and teri garr as the spoiled family in the rv was on target for the time as well anyone who has traveled across country with small children are we there yet will appreciate those scenes the scenes of a small town struggling to survive reminded me a lot of the small town i grew up in but they handled it with the charm and humor that you often only saw in small towns it s sad that many small towns disappeared because of the freeway system and it gives a realistic if humorous view of what they had to do to survive used zoo animals anyone all in all it s a lightweight comedy with no particular message but a humorous glance at america during the early 80 s well worth watching if you just need a bit of good cheer,1
2116,for their credit this is one of their more competent pieces of trash and that s because there s considerably good gore and an interesting take on ripping off snakes on a plane but if there s any more of example of the inconsistency behind asylum s newest rip off it s the two characters at the beginning whom are illegal immigrants and can t understand nor speak english to a texas man sneaking them across the border yet when they get on a train and meet a friend they begin understanding and speaking perfect english aside from being a pretty bad depiction of a hollywood formula snakes on a train is utterly boring at least with snakes on a plane we were given the chance to watch actors wax comedic and attempt to be remotely interesting the mallachi brothers installment features some of the most boring characters i ve ever seen from an electrical engineer gee i wonder how he comes in handy later on to some stoner surfers right down to our two main characters attempting to fight off the snake curse that lurks in the husband s wife snakes is never entertaining and even when it s very gory it s still never as good as it has the chance to be because snakes could have been a funny short film and instead just takes itself much too seriously and never camps it up at any moment instead of taking their small budget and making original films that can set a precedent they instead force their small budget to work against them in these knock offs while the mallachi brothers seem to be trying the train just looks incredibly artificial it seems almost like a stage play with these inconsistent and awfully bland set pieces that try desperately to look like actual train cars while every so often it shakes the background of the windows are blurred and the sound effects go off every now and then to let us know they re actually on a train not to mention that in such a large extended train there only seems to be about ten passengers on it and beyond the train fight and a drawn out sex scene we re forced to be subjected to a plot that makes zero sense and not even the directors can work around the fact that the lethal snakes that go on this train look far from venomous or dangerous the rest of the film staggers onto only about a minute of snake carnage and a bad subplot of an ex drug agent trying to molest a passenger all of this dull exposition ends with a really ridiculous climax in which a poorly computer generated snake i saw better animation on the super nintendo completely swallows the train whole and is then dispensed in a method that should have been exercised from the very beginning asylum scores again asylum scores yet again with a hackneyed lazy horribly directed and boring rip off of another better film snakes on a train takes itself way too seriously and that s why it s never entertaining or memorable,0
13532,i agree with msinabottle this is a great movie here are some dialogue snippets raisuli sean connery to eden pedecaris candice bergen you see the man at the well how he draws the water when one bucket empties the other fills it is so with the world at present you are full of power but you re spilling it wastefully and islam is lapping up the drops as they spill from your bucket raisuli the english have paid very well in the past pedecaris well you ll not have your way with the americans president roosevelt will have your head for this raisuli roosevelt this president roosevelt he would try and take it himself pedecaris he certainly would he is a man of grit and strong moral fiber he does not kidnap women and children raisuli what kind of rifle does he use pedecaris a winchester raisuli winchester winchester i have no knowledge of this rifle pedecaris you will teddy roosevelt brian keith the american grizzly bear is a symbol of the american character strength intelligence ferocity a little blind and reckless at times but courageous beyond all doubt oh and one other trait goes with all previous newspaper reporter and that mr president teddy roosevelt loneliness the bear lives out his life alone indomitable unconquered but always alone he has no real allies only enemies but none of them are as great as he newspaper reporter you feel this might be an american trait teddy roosevelt certainly the world would never love us it may respect us it may even grow to fear us but it ll never love us for we have too much audacity and we re a bit blind and reckless at times too,1
13165,i m not sure what intrigues me about this movie so it is grainy poorly written bleached out often ridiculous and at many points mind numbingly dull the person i was watching it with fell asleep twice and yet there is something in this film that fascinates me though i am not sure what perhaps the character of sam an enormous former patient who was lobotimized by the former head doctor and who is perpetually sucking on an ice pop or the marvelously played head doctor i forget her name anyway watch it and form you re own opinion it has one of the greatest endings i have seen in film,1
16405,co scripted by william h macy from arguably donald e westlake s best and hardest to find novel a travesty very faithful to the story the movie stars macy as a hapless man who gets in way too far over his head after attempting to cover up an accidental death costars adam arkin and james cromwell in good supporting roles the strength of the movie is in the intricate twist after twist storyline and in the acting particularly by macy who routinely and delightfully breaks through the 4th wall here and gets away with it every time a good storyline with much dark humor this one engaged me enough that i ve watched it three times in the week since it came out prepare to shelve your critical faculties and emit a loud bipartisan wheeeeee,1
11945,there is only one reason this movie is watchable till schweiger he is such a good actor the movie isn t completely terrible uwe boll please take up another career the special effects and action are acceptable all other aspects were very disappointing all i can say is that kevin smith an evening with talked about tim burton not ever reading the batman comics and it showed uwe boll must not have ever played the video games that he keeps making movies about if you two ever want to know how it is done go see andrzej bartkowiak doom was one of the best video games to film adaptations ever some people may disagree but if you watch the movie you can see that the guys at id had a lot to do with doom it doesn t seem like anyone at ubisoft was even near this production,0
5734,first of all i d like to say i am a teenager so this is all marketed towards me and i can safely say that icarly very poor programing and the fact that it s accepted among both genders baffles me it contains some of the worst attempts at comedy i ve ever witnessed with mediocre acting to boot the supposed humor within the show is all based on saying someone s lines again with poor sarcasm poor sarcasm saying bad one liners and well you get the picture also i should mention that i do still watch spongebob which i know i ll get a negative backlash for but that s quality programming with some honestly funny moments in it less we forget something icarly s missing wit the show s about a young girl carly putting on a web show with her friends which i can say is without a doubt a nicer version of the internet that s fine but the show s just well not funny at all as previously stated if this is what children s programming has come to today parents show them something that s actually funny spongebob or rocco s modern life would work also compared to it s brothering show drake josh it s terrible which was implied seriously please watch something worthwhile even for a children s show it s poor,0
4858,ed wood is rolling over in his grave he could have made a hundred cult classics for the price of this waste hole the worst script in memory it makes x men 3 sparkle like citizen kane the most amateur directing pre k cinematography the cheesiest special effects i m talking about friday the 13th sequel territory and throw in a pointless revolting deeply disturbed maternity ward sequence the lack of any talent or sensibility that put this garbage on screen is astounding that the industry might reward anyone involved in this celluloid cess pool with future projects ought to be cause for serious alarm,0
1066,all i could think while watching this movie was will it ever end it was unbearably boring to watch i was wishing i could just turn it off but i wanted to do this review justice so i fought the good fight and withstood the torture of watching this movie all the way through so that you the good reader need not bear that pain also this movie sounds like it has a great premise if you read the premise on paper however the actual movie does not deliver on this premise at all the opening scene features a mineshaft in the early 1900 s where they are forcing kids to carry dynamite into the tunnels that aren t big enough for the adults to fit into this seems to be setting up the premise for an interesting movie but after 4 minutes it becomes clear that is not the case the adults who committed these crimes are never punished there is no consequences shown in the movie for their actions the opening scene is way better than and completely irrelevant to the rest of the movie the last time an opening scene misrepresented a movie so grievously was the opening scene of 28 days later which was the only good scene in that whole movie wicked little things zombies a movie so crappy they changed the title to try to disguise it s crappiness and sell it again is exactly the same in this regard the opening scene is the only watchable scene in the whole movie instead the movie flashes forward to present day a single mother and her two bratty foul mouthed kids right here is when it would have been wise to press the stop button and never go near the movie again in the first hour the zombie kids are barely even seen they get maybe 3 minutes of screen time total all they do is kill a pig that s it the rest of the hour is spent showing the dumb mother and her dumb kids buy things at the local store wander around the forest and have inane conversations with each other the dumb teenage daughter goes and hangs out with some other idiot teenagers and smokes weed with them there would be no reason to care at all if the zombie kids dispatched anyone in this movie every single character is both dumb annoying with no redeeming qualities at all not to mention one dimensional and clich d this movie would have been vastly improved if the mother and her dumb kids were dispatched in the first 10 minutes by the zombie kids as they were driving up to their new house then the end credits rolled that right there would instantly change the score from 1 10 to 10 10 honestly when the dumb mother takes her eyes off the road and almost crashes into a pedestrian on the road her daughter scolds her you almost killed us mom of course anyone with common sense knows that if the mom had hit the pedestrian it would be the pedestrian who would be dead not the people safely encased inside the car i guess this line was put into the movie to show firsthand that the utter stupidity of the main characters knows no bounds and runs in the family wicked little things zombies runs for 1 hour and 34 minutes but it definitely felt like 5 hours or more to me trying to not fall asleep was a tremendous challenge it s not until over an hour has passed into the 1 hour and 34 minutes that the zombie children actually bother to kill any person then the scene shows the dumb teenagers drinking beer and making out in a car and saying lines like if you ever wanna get in my pants again you better start the car and get my ass out of here right now seriously that s verbatim from the movie the teenagers are so clich d one dimensional badly acted dumb annoying that when the zombie kids finally get around to hacking 3 of them up 1 hour and 5 minutes into the movie it feels like a cause for celebration of course the princess dumb weed smoking foul mouthed beer drinking loser daughter of the main mother character gets away scott free what a buzzkill that was she was on the screen longer than the others and hence the most annoying of the 4 of them and most deserving of a pickaxe to the head all the more reason why she should have been dispatched within the first 10 minutes as aforementioned to still keep her around past 1 hour and 5 minutes though is totally inexcusable the reason for this of course is that feature length movies need to be padded to at least 1 hour and 30 minutes so by keeping her alive long past when she should be they have an extra 27 minutes to pad the movie with her and her mother running through the woods by 1 hour and 22 minutes in it s the second time in the movie where the annoying daughter is trapped in a vehicle where the engine won t start whilst the zombie kids are coming to get her the zombie kids are completely generic never say anything no character development at all for any of them in the end all 3 of the annoying idiotic main characters live which in my opinion is the filmmakers way of giving a final flipping the bird gesture to the viewing audience in my opinion the filmmakers surely know that they have bamboozled anyone who has had the great misfortune to watch the whole movie why not rub their faces in it by not even giving them the satisfaction of seeing any of the 3 main characters who should have been dispatched within the first 10 minutes die avoid wicked little things zombies like the bubonic plague,0
3531,the film s tagline is you think you know who you are you have no idea i reject both the suggested idea that i have no idea who i am and the inferred suggestion that this film tells me who people truly are if people in real life are really like this then man we re screwed a bilious film that i walked into late and left prematurely a film which is so wrapped up in its goal of becoming the race film of all time that it loses sight of the very tools a film must use the rules of hollywood are such if you show something in the first half it must be used in the second half thus the gun that the daughter worries about her father buying will somehow find its way into the story in the second half the rules of hollywood are to make dialog real a concept which changes with every decade is this real dialog somehow less ludicrous than the real dialog of kevin smith ten years ago the rules of hollywood state that we set the scene and as action rises the camera moves in closer to the faces in this film primarily so we can see the supposed shame humiliation and transcendental realism of the characters the strings increase the frame rate slows down and our heart is meant to break this film is as crassly manipulative as it is vapid i have my own prejudices against l a which i freely admit so to combat this prejudice i will not say that this is a natural situation stemming from the location but rather probably from the author and director the writer paul haggis already showed a taste for polemics over humanity in his million dollar baby which at least had a director who understood how to make the vision of the film bring out the best of a script s ideas now that paul haggis has his own hands on the camera it becomes obvious that not only does he not know how to write true natural human drama he does not know how to photograph or direct it as well paul haggis comes from the land of tv let us not forget the land of diminished expectations everything is as obvious as a tv movie simply presented for simple minds haggis drills into us over and over again that while on the surface people may seem to be awful they have secret pains hidden this is a nice idea but so hamfistedly presented that the whole juxtaposition of bad good has an amateurish feel structurally the film is broken up in the tradition of magnolia and other earlier films the editing is as typical and conventionally cinematic as could be if there is a dramatic movement such as a door opening or a car driving past between the subject and camera the editors use that extreme movement to give the cut that occurs there a more kinetic quality the problem is that other than the drive to keep things moving there is very little intelligence and thought behind the cuts everything is kept by the books not only are the puppets of this hideous racial punch and judy show ineptly handled but even the curtains are lowered and raised with incompetence the film tries desperately to present reality but there s just no talent whatsoever some of the actors are good some of the actors are bad and all of the performance get muddied together brought down by the low low aesthetics of the film we have cinematography which is technically clear we can see the scene we have a clear understanding of what is happening however not only is the cinematography unremarkable but it is thoughtless camera work and framing which believes that it actually is inspired the result is little stylistic flourishes which one recognizes but do not actually add anything to the drama or pathos for example and this is a spoiler as a father holds his dying child the father might be shot too i didn t stick around to find out the camera sees his face and gives us the famous vertigo track zoom the vertigo shot it was at this point that the film became hysterical and i just had to leave i had to leave because it was so bad i left because i was in the middle of a crowded theater and i wanted to express to the audience that i was sick of emptyheaded hollywood art which is full of sound and fury yet signifying nothing in the bard s own words i hate to waste such good shakespearian references on something this remarkably bad,0
13324,the third and final female prisoner scorpion film directed by shunya ito the series star meiko kaji would complete the series in the fourth installment grudge song directed by the capable yasuhara hasebe who also directed kaji in the excellent stray cat rock sex hunter the original female prisoner 701 scorpion is one of my all time favorites the sequel jailhouse 41 is nearly as good it s generally considered the best of the series and i might agree i think if it ever gets a better release on dvd the original by image is very poor beast stable in my opinion is nearly as good as fp701 it s much slower much more contemplative it has its share of violence and nastiness but there s more focus on the story and the characters sasori kaji eludes detectives in the first scene she is handcuffed to one and lops his arm off and escapes with it in tow which must be seen to be believed and hooks up with a freelance prostitute yuki yuki is being hassled by a local prostitution ring which includes a goofy looking madame with a cage full of pet crows what really surprised me is how sad the movie is yuki s story which is never resolved it heartbreaking the images are startling and ito s direction is masterful it s too bad that he never went anywhere after he left the fp701 series this is an awesome film,1
23870,begotten the magic the terror the slight boredom that begotten is for acquired tastes goes without saying you don t just happen to watch it unless your friends are real art house movie buffs you must dig the weird the macabre the bizarre you must dig cool flicks and you must dig to find diamonds begotten is one of the most visually dazzling and mystifying films ever known to man the visual part is something to behold something no one can prepare you for but since the film is devoid of any type of dialogue the visual part is pretty much the only part begotten is a visual film the soundscapes created for the film are magical and groundbreaking but still the sight of it god commits suicide in a particularly gory scene then from his corpse rises mother earth who impregnates herself with god s semen and gives birth to flesh on bone a retarded child she then abandons him and he gets tortured by heathen like creatures mother comes back to save him but she and her son get murdered by the horrible creatures the film is about the meaninglessness of life and about the fact that we come to this planet to suffer and to die and that when something dies something else is born etc nihilism the film s no 1 quality is of course the visuals the setting those haunting images this other worldly quality after you re done watching you feel like an alien it s that mesmerizing when people say it should last 30 instead of 70 they re right no they re not it could last 40 it s just that everything happens to such a slow pace in fact the plot summary i provided is all that happens in the film like no kidding still it s i don t know glorious like a flame burning away the darkness,1
6303,the acting is generally pretty weak the dialog was also apparently dubbed in after the filming so it just doesn t come across well what do you want for a tv movie annette o toole was ok there were a few strong lines from the parent of the queen otherwise these kids weren t quite up to it didn t impress my kids either on the upside it is only an hour long considering that it got through plot and character development in a creditable fashion the settings and cinematography are ok too some other viewers may like it for sentimental reasons,0
1154,i stopped this movie at 48 minutes and change i don t know maybe it s because i m not swedish or french the cannes commenter or any of those other sleepy places from which the previous reviewers held forth born and raised in ny lived near san francisco for a quarter of a century and now holland i love a good independent film as much as the next movie enthusiast but this in a word isn t funny see now that s funny that you re thinking that i made a mistake i said in a word but then said isn t funny nope no mistake if this is your type of humor i d say you haven t really had much of a life consider your appreciation of this film a symptom and please don t ever write another review i have a tendency to believe them when they re unanimous even if there only were about 3 reviews before mine i figured i might actually be able to save someone else the boredom the anticipation of laughter that never materializes i did smile once or twice though when i started the movie and when i stopped it that should be 10 lines,0
16341,accepted let s see the only reason why i had chosen to see that movie was the hot dog shown in commercials when shrader sp said ask me about my weiner after that i had to see that movie and i watched it with a couple of my friends and wow amazing one of the best films of the year the entire movie i was laughing like crazy the plot in this story is that bartleby justin long doesn t get accepted into any of the schools he applied so he makes another fake college for him and his friends so that he can fool his parents that he did make it into college so he makes the finishing touches and he fools his parents until more students look at the website and see the clicker acceptance is one click away and all these rejects come to this school they face many problems and they just cant seem to get anything right 10 10 loved it now watch it,1
13330,after seeing undisputed 2 i knew what to expect from isaac florentine the shepherd border patrol is a decent flick not van damme s best but definitely not his worst there is some bad acting from vd s supporting cast but it makes sense the storyline and plot has all been done before so it s nothing new i mean this is van damme we don t really expect much of an amazing plot do we so lets talk about what we all want to watch this movie for anyway the fighting without giving anything away i thought the way the fights were filmed and shot were well done way better than a few of vd s recent movies such as second in command in which the entire end fight is horrible with florentine behind the camera and if you ve seen undisputed 2 he seems to know how to photograph fights and enjoys it a few of the fights in the shepherd reminded me of vd s older stuff which is what we all want to see the fights were good and i said hah awesome out loud a few times but i was hoping for just a bit more considering how good i thought undisputed 2 was something i found intriguing was vd s daughter in the film i thought wow she s kinda hot come to find out its bianca van varenberg jc s real life daughter i have never seen her before so that was a nice treat all in all this movie is not half bad yeah the story has been done before but at least jc was attempting to make a good movie next time though add more hand to hand combat i think he still has what it takes to do another big budget movie his acting has improved since he s been doing dtv s and he really is in great shape at 47 i don t know about you but i m one of the ones who thinks that most of his dtv s are actually good with the exception of derailed all he needs to do is get back into bloodsport shape and make a martial arts movie and i think people would respond well even though he s not jet li this movie is definitely worth the rental,1
18548,pink flamingos was revolutionary for its time and even today it s still hard to watch not that i didn t enjoy the film it s hilarious but it s very repulsive and jonh waters pushes the envelope as far as it can go the story concerns babs johnson devine she s the filthiest women alive she lives in a trailer with her son crackers and daughter cotton not to mention the overweight edie who s obsessed with eggs and sleeps in a crib then there s connie and raymond marble two filthy perverts who are jealous of babs they long to outdo her in being the filthiest person alive this means having their janitor impregnate kidnapped women and selling the babies to lesbian couples flashing people in public and even sending babs a turd in the mail babs fights back to prove she s the most deranged person alive which even includes incest murder and eating dog crap and other sick sexual acts it s a film that s fun for the whole family well depending on where you live watch pink flamingos but don t forget your barf bag for more perverse weird sex and bodily functions also see sweet movie,1
12216,for the record i hate spoof movies except for mel brooks and airplane because those are classics and make fun of the clich s not the actual movies itself i think that spoof movies are the bottom of the barrel for both comedy and film i especially hate things created by jason friedberg and aaron seltzer the geniuses behind date movie epic movie and meet the spartans i decided to give the comebacks a look since friedberg and seltzer had nothing to do with the production i was as objective as possible it was just like one of their movies it was basically every sports movie rolled into one with lame kindergarten jokes and disturbing images of bodily injury that s supposed to make me laugh and failed only someone high would laugh at these jokes toilet bowl who wrote this an 11 year old i was surprised to see that this was the creation of the producers of wedding crashers which was actually pretty decent but there attempt at the spoof genre was about as funny as a burning orphanage the only reason that i gave this two stars when it clearly deserved one was because friedberg seltzer had nothing to do with this,0
24017,what has to change in today s attitude towards films like boogie nights is the approach the approach is awful comparing it to pulp fiction seeing only the pornography and all its aspects come on people there is more than that in this beautiful motion picture and to all the sceptics hasn t paul thomas anderson proved himself worthy time and time again magnolia is one of the main reasons i watch american films at all and still have faith in this industry that film making is today and what about there will be blood that is a film that will stay in film history whether u like it or not yeah you the so called consumer you know something f k you you don t deserve this you don t deserve anything so many artists today struggle to get recognition and it has become increasingly difficult to make serious films even mainstream because people just wanna see celebrities doing stupid stuff like that sell out britney spears anyway this was very painful for me to say because i don t want to see this i don t wanna believe that today all it matters is the adding up of numbers sales revenue and sales return i want to see magic the magic that fellini bergman and kurosawa brought and created through the language of cinema because thats what pta is doing he is creating magic,1
7253,this in name only sequel to the classic roadhouse has a dea agent john schaech coming to the rescue of his uncle will patton when the uncle is badly beaten up by a local drug gang headed by that wooden indian of an actor jake busey the gang wants to take over the poor guy s bar for nefarious reasons patrick swayze is sorely missed here schaech is an indifferent actor and not convincing as an ass kicking lawman the fights here are intermittent and not nearly as powerful or vicious as the fights in roadhouse the finale is equally weak some good looking women keep things afloat for a bit there is a terrific fight between a daisy duke type who turns out to be handy with both fists and weapons and a nasty looking babe of busey s who is handy with sharp implements there s also a scantily dressed gal at the beginning who is a fellow agent of schaech s but unfortunately she never reappears in the film too bad she does a brief lap dance for schaech that had my full attention if nothing else roadhouse 2 kicks off with a strip club scene that comes darned close to what a real strip club looks like a rare circumstance in any movie the rest is snooze time,0
21970,thriller is brilliant it is a long video but simply brilliant nonetheless the song itself is excellent add michael jackson dancing and you have a golden phenomenon out of all the videos i have ever seen this is the best if you have not seen the video yet then i urge you the special effects are amazing for it s time everything from the wearwolf transformation to the idea of these creepy zombies slowly raising from their graves is grand spookishly grand that is vicent price has his segment of bone shivering lines known simply as the rap ola ray does good as michael s girl and michael jackson himself the dancing and singing although not during the video itself is unmatched 10 10,1
2695,i didn t expect too much from this movie but i was still disappointed it s supposed to be a comedy but there are only four or five scenes where i actually laughed and i think that s rather poor there is no real plot either i always had the feeling that most of the scenes could have been put anywhere in the movie because there s no connection between them but the worst thing was the acting of kim franke he has one facial expression during the whole movie as if he was supposed to play some retarded guy but i believe that s not the case all in all i rate it four out of ten i ve seen worse movies than this but i wouldn t spend money on this one again,0
24040,i have to hold barney drilling my head every day well i guess there must be reasons first i m convinced that our kids are not stupids they are just kids but they know my 1 and a half years old son selects what to see what s nice or disgusting did you see the news do you think your kids have to know the reality as it is maybe or maybe not we the adults have the responsibility about what we want for our kids and what to teach them a film of drug dealers news about massacres in middle east of course the kids must know there is a real life but they are kids let s give them some mercy what do you want for them if you wanna have kids trained on weapons or the best way to kill a neighbor go ahead impose them lethal weapon kill bill any manga s anime tell them santa s a depraved who enters through the chimney directly to violate them i want illusions for my son don t get me wrong i m not saying barney and friends is the best in fact the show have a lot of defects i read other comments and i agree with most maybe the happiness is made of dreams or illusions at least i want to teach him to grow without fear but cautious that learns to think and believe that everything is not serial killers or hijackers whom they re reasons to worth to grow that at least he can be a little happy with his own dreams so parents don t underestimate your kids they know what they want,1
1202,this is a poor caricature of lonesome dove and larry mcmurtry i love your books with lonesome dove among the top three i have admired the way you view yourself through your characters with such unflinching honesty balanced by never taking it all too seriously i am therefore spoiled why have you come to this comanche moon is not up to your standards i see that you are credited with the screen writing but this is so unlike you i prefer to think it is written by someone else the dialogue makes me claustrophobic wishing someone would break out with a naturally stated sentence the part about genius was agonizing mccrae was unrecognizable chiefly because of the inane words coming out of his mouth well i miss call too the most important missing factors are gus and call and the men they are their matter of fact courage the underlying vein comprised of ethics and honesty their lack of self delusion hard men leading hard lives with a certain undeniable grace some blame has to attach to the labored direction here and throughout all of the cast needed dialect and dialogue coaching while i try to imagine robert duvall as mccrae speaking this same dialogue it comes off better but not much it tries to sound cowboy of few words shy sly grin witty but doesn t half succeed how can it be so different from lonesome dove can the writer have forgotten his characters you have fooled some of the people mr mcmurtry but not this one,0

10342,spoilers more than likely nothing really important you couldn t have figured out yourselves yeah it s really weird i rented it at a blockbuster for the reason it had absolutely no description of the movie on the back of the box only a list of the bands that had songs in it but after that i had a dikens of a time finding it even here on imdb i kept confusing it with night of the demons but you know they re basically the same thing the parts i loved most about this movie was the whole thing in the garage that black gym guy was hilarious the way he screamed all the time even when screaming wasn t really necessary he d let out a listen up now block the door with cars and so they d run cars head on into other cars but then he got balls and shafted by a zombie with a broom stick i believe it was the other part that kinda caught my attention was the part with the crash outside the building with the guys that they girl didn t want to come over to what significant aspect of the movie did that give us what was it why was it there why did the movie end with a guy breaking the tv s in a studio i saw that there was a zombie running towards the screen but he was kinda far away i mean he could have just turned the tv off yes this movie was shot on a whim and yes i hated it good day,0

10568,this series and elon gold were being hyped as the next big thing in sitcoms for nbc well they weren t dennis farina was terribly miscast as the father in law he just seemed so uncomfortable and out of place here the term private convo time was supposed to become the dyno mite catch phrase of the 21st century well it wasn t people were asking then as they still are today when his name comes up who the hell is elon gold i saw him on an episode of the mentalist this evening i mentioned his name and my girlfriend asked who not funny total waste of airtime nbc had really high hopes for this show but it just fell flat,0
23182,there are few movies that have the massive amount of non stop ninja action as ninja iii the domination this is a story of love redemption and revenge however this is mainly a story about flipping out and killing people for no reason at all if you ve been searching for a movie where a ninja goes absolutely nuts and takes all kinds of people to their graves just because he s a ninja and he can do it this is the movie for you i can t think of any movies to compare this to because no movie is this awesome wait oh have you ever seen the thing with two heads there is a part in that where the titular thing is riding around on a motorcycle and about a million cop cars are chasing it them around but they keep crashing and what not because you can t catch the thing with two heads well that is kind of what ninja iii is like i highly recommend this film especially if you like the following things ninjas swords lucinda dickie from breakin and breakin 2 electric boogaloo video games about being a bouncer in a bar ambiguous and underdeveloped love stories or good ninjas,1
16986,this movie was quite a pleasant surprise i had anticipated it for a long time and was afraid going in that it couldn t possibly live up to my expectations it exceeded them i adored this movie hilarious from start to finish stay until after the end credits it is absolutely remarkable how a movie about dumb and annoying characters can be so intelligent witty and engaging with it s obvious matte paintings the movie s future earth recalls the planet of the apes series and other sci fi movies of that era in fact this movie is essentially planet of the apes but with people who are the mental equivalent of apes it moves at a fairly brisk pace and luke wilson carries the movie quite well with a character that recalls the one he played in bottle rocket there s even a not so subtle nod to bottle rocket in an early scene maya rudoulph is also surprisingly good as a former painter who was frozen as well despite all its strengths idiocracy has the distinct feel of a movie that was taken away from the director editor before it could be fine tuned i cannot for the life of me understand why a movie this funny would just be dumped into a few theaters with no advanced screenings no trailers no marketing whatsoever it s as if the studio decided they were not going to spend any more on it and just walked away or maybe they thought the movie had the makings of a cult classic and the only way for it to become a true cult classic was to set it up to fail whatever the case it is a shame because mike judge and this film in particular deserve better i predict this movie will have real legs on dvd and word of mouth will propel it to the success it deserves perhaps the fox executives saw themselves in the characters were confused and thought it was a documentary,1
19152,i am probably a little too old for this movie 16 and being a guy the story is a little too girlie but i really thought it was a cool movie overall all the girls in this movie are so hot and really great actresses from alana to adrianne to deena to kimberly all the way down to the cute girl that plays alana s little sister rachel i am not a huge pop star fan with the lovesick songs but i thought that aaron carter did a really great job in this and seems like he was really into this movie and made it seem real my mom liked all the older farts that she grew up with so that s cool too i kept thinking that i liked a lot of the people and wonder if i will see them again a sequel would be cool i rented this but i might buy it too since i have a ton of dvd s and like to go back to see something that i missed i couldn t buy it at blockbuster though so i don t know where i could buy it right now but i ll look into that anyway i am a 16 year old guy i already said that i know but i would totally take a date to see this it s really good for all ages really i think even my little half sister who is 6 could see this that s what is so cool about it that it is something that all ages can see i m sure that was done on purpose but it really works girls can dream about being with aaron carter and guys like me can dream about all the hot chicks in this movie there is something for everyone,1
19246,life is comprised of infinite possibilities some known others a mystery and destined to remain so and what of the vast unknown the realms beyond which knowledge has no established boundaries or parameters who is to say what exists or what is possible valid questions all of which are raised and explored in the story of a particular individual s personal journey a strange and dramatic odyssey that defies facts and logic in k pax directed by iain softley and starring kevin spacey and jeff bridges in the wake of an incident in new york s central station a man named prot spacey is transported to a psychiatric hospital in manhattan where he is delivered into the care of dr mark powell bridges who attempts to uncover the truth about his patient who claims to be from the distant planet k pax it quickly becomes a challenge for dr powell as prot with his calm direct forthcoming manner and a propensity for produce he eats bananas peels and all and red delicious apples are his favorites is quite convincing but it s powell s job as well as his nature to be skeptical prot s claims however remain intact and stand up even under the most intense probing and the watchful eye of dr powell who finds himself in something of a quandary prot even tells him the exact date and time that he will depart for k pax a scheduled return trip that allows powell but a short time to sort it all out and powell just can t seem to get his mind around the idea that he is dealing with a real alien being and it s something he is going to have to resolve quickly if he is ever going to know the truth and he has to know the truth after all is the only thing that is going to set him free in his own mind softley has created and delivered a sensitive thought provoking film that challenges the viewer by sustaining the mystery surrounding prot while forcing you to reflect upon your own concepts of what is in fact possible and as you never know for sure about prot until the denouement you are able to identify with powell seeing the situation from his point of view and trying to solve the riddle right along with him softley creates an atmosphere of wonder and a real sense of being confronted with something that is truly unique as the story unfolds and you begin to realize that prot just may be what he says he is and in the context of the reality to which the film is disposed it s an engrossing matter to try to wrap your mind around how do you react when all of the evidence is contrary to the physical limitations we ve set for ourselves while at the heart of the film there is a resounding depth of humanity that is evident not only in prot but in dr powell as well all of which makes for an extremely engaging and gripping drama as we ve come to expect kevin spacey gives a brilliant performance as prot presenting his character from the inside out emotionally deep and physically convincing at the same time this is a unique individual and spacey brings him to life with care and the ability to share those moments that are particularly revealing which adds to the believability of the character and the credibility of the story itself for this film to work it is essential that we believe who and what prot is we do and it does spacey simply pulls it off magnificently it s a memorable performance from which evolves a character that will stay with you for a long long time jeff bridges meanwhile emerges on equal footing with spacey adeptly making a very real person of dr powell it s a fairly straightforward role and the challenge for bridges was to take this very normal and ordinary character and make him unique in his own right which opposite the character of prot was no small task and again for this film to work it was necessary for bridges to rise to the occasion and with exceptional skill and being the consummate professional that he is he succeeds without question bridges infuses powell with an underlying complexity and is so giving in his performance that it makes the interaction between powell and prot vibrant and at times intense it s a demonstration of two of the finest actors in the business doing what they do best creating a dynamic that is alive and inspiring it s a great job by bridges who never attempts to steal the spotlight from prot which serves to raise the level of the film to an even higher notch the supporting cast includes mary mccormack rachel alfre woodard dr villers ajay naidu dr naidiu vincent laresca navarro kimberly scott joyce conchata ferrell betty and saul williams ernie an entertaining emotionally involving film k pax is a dissertation on possibilities as well as an examination of the ever evolving complexities of the human condition it s a film that demands an open mind and rewards those who are able to approach it on it s own terms and embrace it in the end it makes you realize just how real k pax is and it makes you appreciate prot s journey and just how much we all share and have in common with those around us human or alien and it may just make you reflect upon your own journey where you ve been and where you re going and that s the magic of the movies i rate this one 10 10,1
21099,i read most of the comments here were everybody saw only the flaws of the movie i agree the director it s not kuprik the actors are not oscar winners but it has something everyone could relate to i don t want to spoil but telling more then the plot the finishing of school and the trip to a big party or if you like to see beyond the metaphor is choosing the way trough life remember that days of youth the days when you or our friend acted like the characters or do you think you should acted like one of them and now you regret you didn t if you can go back in to that time and if you can ask yourself any of this questions maybe the movie wasn t so bad,1
14529,river s edge was one of the most disturbing films of 1986 and for a year that also saw blue velvet you know thats saying something viewed today its lost little of its power and remains much better than the overrated kids the previews for kids played it up to be an expose of the deterioration of the nation s youth in reality it was little more than an exploitation film based mostly around shock value river s edge was promoted as a teen exploitation flick but was in actuality much better the only times it goes from being disturbing to distasteful is the constant image of the dead nude body outside of that the film is thought provoking and for all its minor flaws quite realistic keanu reeves known for being a particularly wooden performer gives his best performance as a burned out teenager ione skye is equally sympathetic and likable dennis hopper on the comeback trail with this blue velvet and hoosiers gives a great performance as the creepy yet pathetic hippie generation leftover crispin glover while always entertaining to watch seems a bit out of place as the manic stoner and leader of the group the best performance however is definitely daniel roebuck as the murderer john roebuck is frighteningly emotionless its a shame he didn t become a bigger star as hes a much better actor than reeves the film is overall fantastic and daring don t mistake this for another lame john hughes clich d high school flick such as the breakfast club this is a shocking piece of nihilism that resonates with the viewer fans of this movie are advised to check out a canadian film from 1981 called out of the blue directed by dennis hopper its another shockingly bleak examination of the generation gap and despite its obscurity may have been an influence on river s edge 7 10,1
24122,albert pyun delivers a very good action drama about a junkie who tries to rip off a big crime lord a lot of style and many very cool actors burt reynold is excellent,1
23999,when a stranger calls is actually a pretty good movie i had never saw the original and so when i watched this i thought it was unique when when a stranger calls was advertised on the television the trailer gave away the ending well i never saw the trailer so when i saw this film i was surprised at how good it turned out to be i walked by it one day and decided i d buy it and now i m lucky i did because i thought it was a very pleasing movie that is a nice little film to own it is getting a lot of unfair treatment and if you re interested in this movie at all don t listen to all the negativity camille belle is not as bad of an actress as everyone makes her out to be and she did a great job in this movie so all you haters get over yourselves lighten up and actually try to enjoy this movie for what it is a fun teeny bopper popcorn flick if you haven t seen it please do for it is a lot more enjoyable than a lot of the other slashers being made recently,1
12041,the best part of this dvd is the cover it goes down hill from there there was no chemistry between the leads the kisses looked like something i traded with my grandmother the sound was so bad that at least i was spared some of the dialoge,0
14718,if you ve ever been to ukraine this movie is absolutely hilarious from teenagers wearing gold chains listening to hip hop and break dancing on the side to jokes about air bags in cars and waitresses in total shock over meeting a vegetarian this movie really captures bits and pieces of ukraine that you would never know unless you went there i spent most of the movie nodding my head and thinking yep that s exactly right it s a lot of fun if you understand russian too because the subtitles just don t always do it justice the actors are so believable and elijah wood does a great job playing a socially inept jewish kid my favorite character is definitely sammy davis jr jr the grandfather s seeing eye dog who is really a psychopathic border collie the characters are so eclectic and likable that you believe that they are real people,1
6748,stars hayden pantierre there have been so many movies that have this exact same plot and this one is just a poor rehashing of it populer white girl moves to ethnic school doesn t fit in soon becomes accepted originality is nonexistent in this and neither are the laughs it uses so many old poorly executed jokes it s annoying i don t know why they think it s a good idea to make made for video sequels to mediocre films but it isn t with that said the positives in this are that all the people in it are fairly competent actors and actresses my rating out of pg 13 for language and sexual humor,0
11662,che is a bad movie and deserves it reputation as an unintentionally funny film it takes a serious subject and presents it like the cliff notes version or classic comics because there isn t much emotion or a proper narrative just episodic segments stitched together with mostly stupid true stories relayed by a variety of yutzes this is a deservedly derided film as it is poorly written and acted however what i have found most interesting about the film is its apparent gay subtext instead of che guevarra and fidel castro working towards a communist cuba they seem to be more of a gay couple with che behaving coy and aloof and fidel as the ardent suitor again and again the film abounds with great lines such as when fidel implores che cuba needs you i need you i am not sure if the studio intended this homosexual undercurrent but it doesn t take a brain surgeon to recognize it i am very surprised that the other reviewers didn t point this out however if you remember this when you watch the film it makes viewing much more exciting and even funnier a final note in recent years che has been very chic even a fashion statement with hoards of brain dead teens who have no idea who he was wearing shirts emblazoned with his face considering he was a cold blooded killer and nihilist an odd combination for a doctor this new reverence for the man is gross what will they do next put hitler or dr mengele on t shirts and posters even communists with consciences should be appalled by the bloodshed guevara was responsible for and i find it ironic that people with computers are championing a man who might likely have killed them given half a chance considering how stupid and unintentionally funny this movie was it does nothing to further the message that guevara was no hero i would love to see a realistic film done of his life with the good and the bad but also with dialog and a plot that weren t apparently created by chimps,0
17099,it seems there are two kinds of people in the world those who think that five characters is one of the best episodes in the series and those who are so cool that they know it sucked because they were so clever and already predicted the lame twist at the end which apparently in their small minds is the only reason the twilight zone exists to come up with twists there are plenty of lame episodes in the series and i m not one to rate all tz episodes ten but this one is certainly one of those that merit such a rating it is claustrophobic and colorful the suspense is built up and we cannot wait for the reveal of the secret at the end but whatever that secret is what these people are it doesn t really matter most of the beauty of the episode is to lead up to that it would be just as powerful if we never find out what these strangers in a strange place really are,1
10818,i totally agree this is pitch black underground and a well worn plot the best scenes i thought were the divers exploring the caves going through impossible subterranean passageways some of them were heart pounding the scenery was great had they dispensed with the staple alien toothy cgi badboys entirely the movie would have been much better all they would have had to do is never show any monsters at all but have everyone wondering and follow jack s descent into madness and this might have been a top rate hitchcock style thriller maybe award material the acting isn t bad but those rubber bats just reduce it to standard fare,0
13128,during the making of this movie i once caught a statement on television about it something like is killingg nget now taking off nazism so my comprehension of this movie was from the beginning to get a notion of nazism when recently seeing this movie in the tv version i had this filter before me and it wasn t difficult to see this strangely enough i haven t met this way of interpreting the film ever since i first heard it these are the things i found in four shades of brown in all four of the stories the lack of empathy leads to disaster 1 the crematory worker shows no realistic empathy to the dead animals or to those who had to say goodbye to them in the crematory room in dealing with death and fire it s almost like a cheerful game to him the seriousness of death and fire is not emphasized by the father and his boy accordingly in ignorance pushes a button that leads to the disaster that injures his father severely possible lesson the importance of showing the young adequate emotions when they grow up they need to know what behavior leads to disaster and what emotions lead to good 2 the magician maneuvers his wife like an invisible puppeteer just when she thinks she has begun to cut off the strings to the masters hand reaching for personality integrity and joy he pulls hard and she is back in desolation and despair their son has tried to revolt in creating his own life with perfection and good taste in opposite to his parents bad taste the real problem he is carrying within is far from comprehensible to him his fathers behavior passes on when suffocating his own wife in his spotless environment possible lesson oppression breeds bondage 3 the father who was abused as a child passes on sadism to his children when he cheats them on their inheritance he robs them of their childhood and in the end even of their inheritance possible lesson when no love given you cannot give any 4 the fathers abuse of his daughter creates in her a ruthless revenger with sadistic aggression here the ice cold nazi sadism becomes very obvious in physical violence it gives a possible background and a somewhat plausible explanation to the actions of young scin head nazists behavior when oppressing others possible lesson can nazism take birth in a pervert home can the hideous consequence of ignoring empathy in family life in the long run be that room is given to sadistic nazism very seldom does a movie contains so much it reveals little by little as i meditate on it i consider it brilliantly painted and the actors are superb especially the nice seeming bloke played by ulf brunnberg that turns out to be the worst of all,1
23829,i feel the niiiiiight heat i feel your heeaaaaaaaaaart beat something ain t right theme song written by b j cook from skylark david foster s old band and wife she also wrote the memorable theme from cbc s airwaves oh night heat what a program well written well acted and totally classic crime solvers and a good team and a dash of humour at the end i d like to think this is really what detectives do did giambone was a real favourite on a canadian tip i learned every canadian actor s name and style from guest spots done on night heat everyone passed through the night heat set and like law order it was story driven so you could just watch and enjoy without a lot of character melodrama,1
19265,i thought this movie was highly underrated the subject matter does seem like it would be a little strange and i was put off at first but once i was watching the movie it didn t seem strange at all i was intrigued with all the different possibilities that the story had to offer and i couldn t wait to find out how it would end once it did end i thought about it for a long time after i was pleased with everything about k pax from the acting and the story and the scientific elements and psychological issues to the ending it s not an especially upbeat or happy film though it does make you chuckle from time to time but i found it to be especially entertaining and thought provoking i own it now and intend to watch it many times,1
7158,before the days of home video stan laurel s pre hardy comedy kill or cure was known to the extent that it was known at all only because a few sequences were included in robert youngson s compilation film laurel and hardy s laughing 20 s youngson knew what he was doing the best gags in kill or cure were brought intact into his compilation while the rest of this only mildly funny comedy remained on youngson s cutting room floor laurel portrays a commercial traveller hawking a patent medicine cried professor i o dine s knox all that name is the funniest joke in this movie which ain t sayin much i should point out that this movie dates from 1923 the shank of prohibition during prohibition quite a lot of americans purchased patent medicine if it had ahem medicinal properties so if knox all contains alcohol stan s job in this movie is less desperate than the one which he and ollie famously had in big business selling christmas trees in the summer too bad for this movie that it s not nearly so funny as big business we see stan but don t hear him in this silent film delivering a spirited sales talk to a man who seems to be paying attention until we learn that they re standing outside a deaf mute institution and this man is deaf a haughty woman emerges from the gates stan quickly tries to engage her attention by wiggling his fingers at her of course she s not deaf and she promptly whacks him with her umbrella i found this sequence offensive not because it involves deaf people the deaf aren t the butt of the joke but because it abets the very widely held misconception among hearing people that they can communicate with the deaf by merely waggling their fingers randomly and performing charades without actually learning the highly complex grammar of sign language more amusingly a spinster in this movie has a pet canary named rudolph as in valentino and there s a gag involving trick photography to enable a man to hide behind an object that s narrower than his body i ve seen this device in several cartoons and live action movies but kill or cure is i think the earliest movie to use it that i ve seen so far stan laurel an under rated actor does one bit of physical business here that s worthy of chaplin or keaton in which he conveys his emotions and a change in his demeanour while walking away from the camera with his back to us still laurel never really became a first rate comedian until he united with oliver hardy to form the greatest comedy team ever kill or cure barely rates 3 out of 10,0
2336,i m sure that the folks who made this movie think they re doing something wonderfully politically correct because they manage to criticize u s wars in afghanistan and particularly iraq by suggesting that the u s does war well but doesn t clean up afterward thus sowing the seeds for future trouble furthermore they do this without making islamists the enemy and without making republicans the enemy since it s the republicans that are in office and are doing this supposedly great thing bringing down the ussr by covertly supplying a war in afghanistan but seriously now do we really want a movie that repeatedly says let s go kill some russians like that s the greatest thing a red blooded american can do and are we supposed to find this congressman adorable because he surrounds himself with women with big hair and revealing clothes even his supposedly smart assistant who is always dressed professionally keeps looking at charlie like he s just the most wonderful handsomest greatest guy around as if she s nancy reagan to his ronnie julia roberts does a bang up job in her role but basically women are really demeaned in this movie and it was really annoying,0
24348,this early warner brothers talkie son of the gods 1930 deals with the racial intolerance that anglo saxon americans show towards the chinese chinese americans are treated like second class citizens and whites hold them in nothing but contempt prolific scenarist bradley king based her screenplay on rex beach s novel about a young impressionable chinaman sam lee richard barthelmess of only angels have wings who experiences racial prejudice first hand when the girls that his college chums bring along for a party reveal their racist sentiments about sam once they learn about his heritage sam goes to his father lee ying e alyn warren of gone with the wind who is a wealthy chinaman with offices not only in new york city but also in san francisco sam feels deeply wounded by the racial slurs and he wants to leave new york and go where he cannot be hurt by americans his patient father warns him that racism is a fact of everyday life and the only solution to racism is tolerance sam has yet to learn this lesson he refuses to take any more money from his father and catches a ship to london england peeling potatoes while he is on board during the trip he encounters a british playwright bathurst claude king of arrowsmith who needs some help writing a play about the chinese sam and he strike up a friendship and sam furnishes him with cultural information about asians while they are relaxing in france sam meets a beautiful young woman allana wagner constance bennett of two faced woman who falls madly in love with him it seems that allana and her wealthy father are vacationing in the same motel everybody at the motel knows about sam being a chinaman with the exception of allana sensitive about his racial heritage sam holds allana at arm s length until she convinces him that nothing could change her mind about him they fall madly in love together allana s father drops the bomb on her when he reveals that sam is a chinaman and all the memories of living in san francisco and dealing with coolies floods allana s mind she storms into the dining room at the motel and publicly flogs sam with a riding crop in front of a room filled with on lookers of course sam is terribly devastated by this reversal of events he thought that allana loved him but she didn t about this time sam s father lee ying falls tragically ill and ying s secretary of sorts eileen mildred van dorn of iron man sends sam a telegram about ying s illness predictably sam rushes home to new york to be at his father s side since his public humiliation sam has vowed to show no kindness to anglo saxon americans eileen is an irish catholic and probably one of his few white friends lee ying dies and sam assumes control of the business and he practices his anti white racism until he learns that he was an anglo saxon foundling that a san francisco cop on the beat gave to lee ying and his wife to bring up the cop forgot about it until two white busy bodied social worker types wanted to take sam away from the yings sam learns this revelation about the same time that allana comes to new york and falls ill during her illness she utters his name repeatedly in her sleep and her devoted father goes to see sam and requests that sam visit her in order to help her recover unbeknownst to allana sam does visit her and she improves but she has no memory of his visit merely a hazy notion eventually allana learns the truth about sam not being a chinaman and they marry and live happily ever after this socially conscientious warner brothers first national pictures release contends frankly and unflinchingly with the race issue for the first hour or thereabouts before the revelation that sam has no chinese blood running in his veins catches both him as well as the audience by surprise the reconciliation between allana and sam stretches credibility despite their self professed undying love for each other however in the name of a happy ending that would erase all the negativity that came before it they wind up in each other s arms the capitulation on the race issue with the revelation that sam isn t chinese damages some of the film s moral power incredibly son of the gods is a pre code film that almost seems prudish for example sam is an american not chinese constance bennett gives a wonderful performance as a petulant beautify and she holds your attention when she whips sam with her riding crop claude king is good as bathurst and e alyn warren is convincing as lee ying interestingly warren made a career out of portraying asian characters richard barthelmess is flawless as sam he delivers a highly nuanced performance despite its age son of the gods is a son of a good movie,1
5276,chip foose is an absolute genius and the end result of the projects are truly amazing the co hosts do a good job i particularly enjoy watching the project come together the end results are much better than when they came off the assembly line what with the mechanical and cosmetic advances of today however i do get annoyed somewhat at the fact the projects seem to be the property of the already rich and or famous it s too bad the ones getting overhauled can afford the undertaking let s see now vince neill of motley crew gets a car make over for his buddy hello if he neill were a true friend he would have paid to have his friend s car restored what a joke another episode shows a middle aged seemingly well to do gal getting her 56 caddy named betsy done the husband of 30 years was behind it all the couple looked like money was not in short supply what a shame i guess the lunch pail guys like me will have to save for the day that will never come i happen to own a 53 ford project chip will somebody pick me,0
21105,i think this is the best norwegian movie i ve ever seen it s about 40 year old andreas who gets hit by a subway train and suddenly finds himself in a strange city however everything here has been made ready for him he has got a job a house and clothes at first this city seems perfect no death no pain and no problems everywhere there are men in gray suits who cleans up and fixes everything that doesn t fit into their definition of perfect however andreas can t really seem to fit in and starts to long back to his old world and tries with all means to get back the thing that impresses my the most in this movie is how they way of making the city seem so surrealistic even though i have seen a lot of these places in real life they seem so distant another thing that contributes greatly to the is the performance from the actors trond fausa aurvaag is just the perfect guy to play the confused and bothersome andreas and all the other characters are also doing a great job by playing apathetic sounds like a hard job doesn t it the strong difference between andreas and the others leads to very amusing situations as well all in all this is a fabulous movie the plot may be a little confusing but the movie has such a great atmosphere i would recommend that everyone should go see it and i wouldn t recommend listening to ccscd212 as it seems he has seen too many commercial american movies and seems to have became too used to just getting served the moral on a silver plate the way i see it there is not much in this film that tries to tell us about suicide being right or wrong i consider it more of a warning of a direction our society seems to be taking but sure everyone can see a film in their own way,1
8808,this miniseries movie was so terrible at times that i nearly broke down and turned it off i am a great fan of the novel however this movie suffers from multitudes of problems the costuming is poor and many of the more emotionally charged scenes are blase the departures from the novel are poorly chosen significant nuances are missed or rewritten,0
854,don t see this movie it s repulsive the start is indeed very good but in the middle everything falls and i really regret spending 80 crowns about 11 dollars on the ticket peter dalle should consider this as his last chance to gain peoples interest awful picture the only bright spot is the splendid work of robert gustavsson lena nyman and g sta ekman hope you take my advise the picture is rubbish,0
15819,gilmore girls is one of the funniest most clever sharp witted sarcastic and heart warming television shows i ve ever watched second only to my most favorite television show of all time f r i e n d s the quick pace and many pop culture references can leave some viewers confused but once you catch on to the ways of the gilmores you ll be hooked for life just some random comments i recently finally began watching season 6 and wow it s one of my favorite seasons so far i love the luke lorelai thing and all the drama in the various episodes is as always exhilarating the only thing i m not so fond of is the surprising bad attitude and reckless actions rory has suddenly adopted unfortunately i don t find this very realistic and hope it s not just a way to stir up some more drama to keep the season going strong all in all great season though and i can t wait for the next ashly a k a tookie clothespin,1
2824,well where to start describing this celluloid debacle you already know the big fat nada passing as a plot so let s jut point out that this is so pc it s offensive hard to believe that frank oz the same guy that gave us laugh riots like little shop of horrors and bowfinger made this unfunny mess so this guy doesn t know he s gay till this actor points it out ok sure if anyone ever says i m gay i ll know the truth even if i currently like girls more than george luca likes a dollar and how to know the true nature of my sexuality well if i like classic litterature dancing and barbra streisand i m gay if i dress like a blind man in a hurry with half my shirt hanging out i m straight oh sure and here s the big clich of clich s no matter how you look there s always a very attractive hollywood actor who ll adore every bit of grease under your skin or a top model who ll love your zero iq your butt ugly face and your pointing out ears if all those gay common places weren t enough to get me angry this did in real world looks matter folks and i know for sure i see it coming now you ll say relax it s a comedy don t take it so seriously if being a comedy gives anything carte blanche to suck out loud i think the world has a serious problem wouldn t be much better and funnier to make a movie to denegate those old tiresome clich s instead of magnifying them over and over again so one of the absolutely worst movies i ve ever seen 1 out of 10 if giving this rating has something to do with my sexual tendence please let me know i m interested,0
225,i tried to watch this adaptation but it was just so awful i couldn t torture myself like that the performances were quite sub par with the exception of ariel fonda was way over the top in a role that should be handled with some subtlety i have studied shakespeare and seen many adaptations and this is by far the worst one i have ever seen i have to wonder why on earth someone made this film shakespeare can and has been beautifully adapted in many cases this is not one of them if you must watch this film may i suggest a drinking game take a drink every time they go off book from the original idea and two drinks every time fonda overacts you should be quite drunk in a very short time,0
20001,i saw this movie by accident while in paris i went into the wrong theater by accident and by the time i realized it wasn t a preview or a short film i was hooked paulina does a phenomenal job of holding your attention with her acting i can t say enough how impressed i was with her portrayal of this real femme fatal the rest of the cast performs very well too don t get me wrong this is not the greatest film ever made but given i knew nothing about it i was left with a lasting and very positive impression finally not speaking french in france paid off for once i didn t stop talking about this film for 3 weeks after seeing it,1
17566,autumn spring tells of the misadventures of a dapper walrus faced 78 approx year old czech man who haplessly befuddles and bemuses all who know him with his mischievous ways while his wife meticulously plans her funeral centerpiece hana brodsk shows us how to get babes to kiss you when your 78 and how to cop a feel in an elevator and get thanked for it as he pranks his way from day to day in this warm and glowing look at old age and one man s creative amusing but socially unacceptable ways of enjoying life while refusing to be relegated to the old folk s home autumn spring is a plodding subtle comedy with messages for all ages which will have the greatest appeal with more mature foreign film buffs b,1
539,i have been a fan of the carpenters for a long time read the biography watched the specials and saw the karen carpenter story this movie really didn t show the real karen carpenter in the movie she seems to be a shy and a pretty much of loner except for one girl friend the real karen carpenter was much different she was outgoing and friendly she had lots of friends especially olive newton john the movie doesn t even show karen s attempts for a solo album and her meeting phil ramone and his wife itchy karen itchy knew the real karen carpenter in new york when karen was in new york she did see a psychologist but it was voluntary and once a day and then she would leave to go to her hotel room also karen was taking pills to increase her thyroid so she could loss weight but stop taking them because the psychologist recommended her not too also the karen s husband in the movie is named bob knight but in real life was named tom burris also karen wasn t divorced from tom but only separated karen was to sign the divorce papers on the day she died also agnes found karen naked in the closet unciousness unlike in the movie where she was dressed in white the music was very good that was the only thing i would recommend on seeing it,0
793,every great romantic comedy needs conflict between the romantic leads to lend suspense anticipation and allure to the plot this story falls completely flat in this area there is no conflict at least none that would inhibit the eventual joining of the two lead characters and so suspense is flat there is no anticipation and there really is no allure at all the chemistry between richard gere and diane lane is representative of friendship at best and with the talent of these two particular actors i was quite surprised during the movie i expected them more to play a game of checkers and chat about the weather than see any moving passion while i m a fan of both actors i do believe that the casting in this movie was off or perhaps the direction was off base and it impacted their deliveries the writing was very weak which also might have impacted the performances most certainly the script could have used some help from some harlequin writers who have real experience putting the heat in romance this movie may be worth watching on a rainy sunday afternoon but only after it s on the cheap shelf sorry diane ladd and richard gere,0
10350,the girls might be prettier if you re their accompanist or a faced onlooker what i m sayin is that it ll take special circumstances for a non whince reaction to this effort the delivery of many lines appears to be distractingly unnatural for some actors lighting seems to be a problem too although failing eyesight may have accounted for my frequent squinting and if you view this film be open minded enough to accept elements that no zoo or circus would reject they are the above and below ground creatures who feasted on dozens of campers near an empty louisiana mansion that s the discovery of a trio who is dispatched from their printed media to investigate the deaths then two of them disappear and the survivor is part of another threesome who take up the hunt eureka i just realized what one of those aforementioned special circumstances would be unconsciousness,0
21981,i m like the rest of the fans who love this comedy i ve been waiting for it on dvd i ve got it on vhs and got so fed up waiting for a release and worrying that my vhs copy would ruin i got the equipment to get it onto dvd the picture and sound are excellent to my utter surprise if anyone else want s a copy drop me a line atstone stew yahoo co uk and for 7 00 i ll put it onto a dvd print the dvd and get it in the post to you 7 00 just covers my costs recorded delivery etc with maybe a little over so i m not after making money out of it i d just like the world to see this ignored gem of a comedy i recently saw a copy of ebay got for over 26 amazing how can they not release this classic email me for payment details like cheque or paypal etc etc,1
4107,breaker breaker has chuck norris as a truck driver and a karate master talk about juggling two disparate careers he gives a load he can t deliver to his younger brother michael augenstein and then when the young man doesn t show up chuck goes looking for him what young augenstein has got himself into is a speed trap run by judge george murdock who comes from the roy bean school of jurisprudence of course norris deals with matters in the usual chuck norris way and when he gets in trouble the call goes out over the cb for all the truckers to come and help their good buddy this speed trap known as texas city has a bad reputation and the drivers are only too happy to help a pal chuck s of course quite a bit younger and with no facial hair in this one he s got the tight lipped look of a man who realizes the academy won t be looking at this gobbler george murdock is overacting outrageously as the judge roy bean wannabe this one is strictly for the fans of chuck norris,0
17530,i think this was the most outstanding edge of your seat thriller that i have seen in a long time the research for the film was thorough the writer kelly sane has left no loose ends the cast was seasoned fantastic performances all round omar metwally was outstanding the cinematography is poetic music enchanting and the overall effect highly satisfying rendition goes into territory that even the media fears to tread it is really a wakeup call for those involved with espionage and the legal web that is the war on terror a woman walked out of the theater and asked me does this really happen that in itself speaks of gavin hood s masterful achievement,1
17471,league of gentleman has been the most disturbing british sitcom to be on t v and how can a funny movie be so bad rated they just have no taste this film will make you want to watch over and over again and still find it funny it is surprising that it has done bad but it is british the cinema do crap most of the time but this time it in my words a boost with comedy with a giraffe spunks over lady s this is a top british comedy and better than dodge ball so by this and it won t prove you wrong as i don t really laugh through films but this film was amazing through comedy with the best characters but i was a bit disappointed of how much edward and tabb s were in there for back to typing buy this film and it won t disappoint you,1
16552,i used to watch this show when i was growing up when i think about it i remember it pretty well if you ask me it was a pretty good show anytime i think about it i don t remember the opening sequence and theme song very well in addition to that everyone was ideally cast also the writing was very strong the performances were top grade too i hope some network brings it back so i can see every episode before i wrap this up i d like to say that i ll always remember this show in my memory forever even though i m not sure if i ve seen every episode now in conclusion if some network ever brings it back i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good,1
11248,i like arnold and i love the subject matter but this was a very disappointing movie when i first saw the previews they were dark and ominous and arnold s name wasn t even mentioned but i recognized him which led me to believe that he was making a movie that had more of a serious suspenseful mood that it wasn t just another schwarzenegger action vehicle though i admit most of his are pretty good he had thus far avoided movies with any real religious theme and i was excited i was wrong this is just another action explosion gun fire movie and it s a pretty bad one,0
7673,this is just art house rubbish i sat watching this trash with my bosnian friends they found it as boring as i did for a more interesting and more true account watch the excellent movie saviour this is just a snoozefest with people talking in coffee shops a cure for insomnia 1 out of 10,0
15529,a remarkable film bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings i had when i was much much younger i loved it and the elton john music i remember seeing in in the movies when i was a kid and for some reason limited release i ve never known anyone else who saw this film when it was released the dreams it inspired in me from decades ago have never left me and seeing the film again recently brought it all rushing back i confess however that my kids in their 20 s have not experienced a similar emotional rush a generational thing why is it not on dvd,1
14959,i ve been studying brazilian cinema since 2004 when i stumbled onto cidade de deus city of god let me tell you something this movie is probably as good or better than city of god the acting cinematography and music supervision make this movie a unique experience i have not been to brazil yet but this movie presents the harsh reality that is beset before the citizens of s o paulo i recommend this movie if you enjoy good cinema this movie is disturbing and you may feel a bit despondent after watching it something you want to watch but nothing you want to go to sleep on,1
24036,i was a bit surprised to see all of the hate comments on here sure it s not the best kid s show but don t people stop despising barney this much after the fifth grade okay everyone hates barney okay i think his voice and songs are annoying okay he s kinda creepy and strange i m fourteen years old so i know well enough but here s the thing kids they love this show when i was a little kiddie of two or three my parents spent more time chasing me around the house than they did anything else nothing could hold my attention for more than ten minutes face it that s how toddlers are even the most patient ones can t sit still long enough to give their parents a break there s too much to do and see and explore too much trouble to get into and then came barney i don t know exactly what it is about the purple dinosaur that s so amusing to children but they sure do love it i know i did i was hooked on the show and wanted to watch it over and over yes the songs kind of drove my parents nuts but to be able to watch their kids learning and being excited over something that can really hold their attention span it s worth it i learned my abcs and 123 s the magic words and brushing your teeth i d grown out of it by five or six of course but by that point at least i was a little more patient and gave my parents a break my nieces and nephew all went through the barney stage growing up much to their mother s delight i know what keeps barney on the air he entertains of course there s big bird ernie and oscar and they re great too but at the toddler stage it seems that more kids prefer the big singing dinosaur and that s enough for me,1
4632,terrible acting terrible script wholly unrealistic the bumblebee flies anyway exemplifies the cliches and sentimentalism that movie studios love to cram down viewers throats elijah wood is unimaginably bad in the primary role and the plot points are contrived and sappy cook s and wood s relationship is laughable at best but the worst element of bumblebee is the script this is some of the most mind numbingly bad dialogue i have ever had the misfortune to hear bumblebees actually crawling inside my ears and stinging my eardrums would be preferable to hearing elijah wood robotically spit out his pseudo profound lines i wish a bumblebee project would be performed on me so i could mercifully have no memories of this stinker,0
22583,my wife is a mental health therapist and we watched it from beginning to end i am the typical man and can not stand chick flicks but this movie is unbelievable if you want to see what it is like for someone who is going through these type of struggles this is the movie for you as i watched it i found myself feeling sorry for him and others like him spoiler plus the fact that all the individuals in the movie including the people in the mental institution were the actual people in real life made it that more real a must see for someone in the mental health profession,1
6287,i have seen this movie and in all honestly was quite disappointed and in my opinion this movie lacks heart i frankly didn t care what happen to the characters by the end of the movie there was so much there they could have done with the movie that they didn t because they were either so rapped up in trying to be obscure and make some deep comment on life or trying so hard not to that the characters and story were completely lost in all of it i have seen another picture by this director and enjoyed it well enough but i felt this film lack of the whimsy and heart of the other and i was left wondering what the point was or if the point of the movie was that it had no point honestly while i didn t feel like tearing my hair out during the movie i did remorse the lost time on the sad little film i have no doubt that some people will love this movie but frankly i didn t,0
1028,why oh why did they have to try and make a sequel to one of the greatest christmas movies of all time the movie is a train wreck on every level and should have never been made randy quaid s portrayal of cousin eddie is an over the top caricature of his previous outings as cousin eddie also the eddie character is not interesting enough to carry an entire movie even eye candy sung hi lee could not redeem this hunk of holiday crap please do not waste your time on this move just watch the original again,0
10922,produced by nott entertainment this movie is nott very good at all i sat through the first 15 minutes of the film before judging that the acting is bad the casting is bad and camera work is bad as i hear that there is a download of this film floating around on the internet it is nott even worth the bandwidth up until the time i wrote this review the average vote for this movie was an 8 5 which prompted me to view it and there was an average high majority of 10 s for it obviously voted on by liars and shills this movie is nott for everyone or parents if you want to punish your kids with this awful film have them sit through this one for halloween,0
22807,on the outside this film is better because of vincent d onofrio law order criminal intent but this film is equally as good as the 1982 version in some ways the 1999 version is better because it s more up to date a decade as compared to the 27 years the actors in this film were great like terry kinney mcmanus of hbo s oz as james daly and tony shalhoub usa s monk and gary sinise csi ny obvilubuly dialogue was changed for contemporary audiences nut much of the writing remained the same there were stuff that wasn t in the 1982 version that gave this one a boost in drama and comedy but in the end this film was just as great at the 1982 one character wise vincent d onofrio playing phil romano was excellent better that paul sorvino it s a match up between stacy keach and terry kinney in terms of james as for george i would praise shalhoub and between martin sheen sinsise as tom i would say sinise wins,1
4468,this movie sucked the first one was way better no one from the first has returned in this dumb sequel and in some way that is a good thing because of the bad acting but the characters in this film are not even better killjoy in the woods come on give me a break i m suprised killjoy s friend the blair witch didn t show up to make a cameo bad acting bad story and just plain out silly and boring don t waste your time,0
1646,i had to watch this one for my canadian cinema course and i was told that it was considered to be the best canadian film when i watched this i really did not agree considering i ve seen a lot better ones i understand that there were canadian themes and messages but the fact that the characters and the plot were so disconnected with me as a spectator it made me not really care what the film was trying to tell me the plot was too dry the characters did not have many positive personality traits but this is to emphasize the messages not to tick off spectators this film shows a little about the history of quebec not a very interesting film it definitely does not deserve to be put on such a high pedestal,0
2143,tempest is based on the classic shakespearean work of the same name but bears little resemblance to its source material it masquerades as being as cerebral as its namesake but instead is a jumbled convoluted and hackneyed exercise in tedium the original probed the premise that people have an evil side which would be destructive if unchecked here you just get an uninteresting mid life crisis yawn goof ball who is having everything go wrong in his personal and professional life he becomes endowed with a supernatural power that he uses to try to control his environment in other words to get his own way every few minutes after something else in his pathetic life goes wrong he finds a secluded place and starts babbling show me the magic while waving his hands around and making a serious concentration expression from the way these scenes are shot it looks like he s trying to turn bugs into other kinds of bugs turning a spider into a cockroach maybe but by this time you really don t care the story has him bolt from his life with his daughter to a greek island somewhere then have a awkward relationship with some girl he meets one of the dullest romances ever committed to film the story just bogs down and moves at a slower and slower pace you are never given any reason to like or dislike anyone i ll give this a 2 because of the beautiful greek location shots and the semi optimistic conclusion although it isn t clear if the tempest power brought this ending about or not the spirit of shakespeare s work has been captured much better in other movies one notable example is forbidden planet which gave credence to how the power gets out of control as for this tempest its only magic is to cure insomnia,0
21062,christine lahti sandy dunlap and mary tyler moore holly davis worked well with soapish material ted danson did his best with a thankless role of chip davis the premise of this that the two ladies friendship one a seemingly happily married woman and the other a career woman who is aware of her biological clock ticking i found the relationship that ted danson s character had with the single woman played by christine lahti s rather sordid he behaved in a caddish way yet he left two widows pining over him bawling i found it revolting when when sandy told him she wanted to break it off after meeting his wife he calls her saying he misses her did he call his wife there was no sign of that he behaved like a heel it perhaps would have made a more interesting film had he not been killed off perhaps both ladies would have wised up and dumped him i liked the friendship between the two ladies but it was spoiled by what they had in common the cad of a husband,1
14898,i would like to thank you for giving me a chance to be one of the first to actually view the film it really does grip you john paul does eventually get to see the light and make a life for himself away from being tied to his mothers apron strings i imagine there must be so many families these days in the same position especially with children leaving home older but i wouldn t say wiser with very sad parents who haven t really got lives of their own and who make their lives a misery i think this film should definitely have a wider audience i would also say that the other actors played brilliant parts as well it is such a deep film and very moving,1
21096,all i can say is that i was expecting a wick movie and blurred surprised me on the positive way very nice teenager movie all this kinds of situations are normal on school life so all i can say is that all this reminded me my school times and sometimes it s good to watch this kind of movies because entertain us and travel us back to those golden years when we were young as well lead us to think better in the way we must understand our children because in the past we were just like they want to be in the present time try this movie and you will be very pleased at the same time you will have the guarantee that your time have not been wasted,1
17092,two young friends grow up together in afghanistan the events of their lives drive them apart and one of them has now been living in the usa for a good number of years as he receives a phone call it is clear that he has to return for there is trouble in the air this is a film about life lasting friendships mistakes and making up again but also a film about darkness pain and endurance from the pleasurable young days of growing up and playing games to the falling apart back to the playing of games this is a slow film but not too slow it plays on emotions and that is quite right for a drama but it does so a bit too much for my liking this makes it too much of a tearjerker loosing it a bit of the quality it carries it is still good but not fantastic 7 out of 10 kites ran aground,1
1021,i did not quite get barnens o it is one of the weirdest ones i have watched the soundtrack was quite unusual as well written and performed by jean michel jarre it makes the movie weirder than it was i have to admit that i was almost going to change it and watch another one instead at times the movie seemed plain dumb to me or boring or confusing there are quite a few sexual references in that movie trough they too are kind of messed up probably the only phrase that i will remember out of it is going to be when you are alone you can control things and i will show them or something like that the boy in that movie was obsessed with the idea of not growing up the last summer as a child he thought once and he sure lived it to the max so if you have few hours to spare you can watch this movie but you won t miss much if you don t,0
11148,the plot involves a new hipper franchise barbershop that is moving across the street from calvin s barbershop so he feels like he has to change and improve his shop by getting newer stuff and such sounds real exciting huh as for the rest of the film a lot of it involves the same material from the first film the people that work at calvin s stand around talk loud and mouth off to each other and the customers once again cedric the entertainer was mildly funny but it is more like he s doing a stand up routine than anything to do with the movie and calvin is faced with another moral issue involving taking a large sum of money he s already shown that he will do the right thing in the end final verdict nothing new i don t recommend it unless you thought the first barbershop was the best thing since sliced bread,0
18465,if you enjoyed the tv series diagnosis murder you ll love murder 101 it s great to see dick van dyke in a murder mystery again if we re lucky this one will be a start of a tv series or at least series of movies this movie definitely had some great and notable actors filling the roles but it didn t feel like a face movie it was really a story that drew you in making you forget about the fame of those on the screen i made a guess as to the ending and was so pleasantly surprised at the end that i had to watch it again this is a must see for any mystery buff or dick van dyke lover,1
11540,mickey rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment and fair play to him i always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as angel heart and johnny handsome you know what you are going to get with rourke mean moody dirty but this film gives you much more and you don t want most of it first and foremost this whole thing just doesn t make sense rourke is a hardened ira killer who after killing a bus load of schoolchildren flees ireland for london he is on the run from the cops and from his own army comrades he has also vowed to never kill again it looks like the bus full of kids finally did it for him however when he gets to london he is tracked down by a local mobster bates looking like his eyebrows and hair came straight off a burton s dummy to kill his main competitor in turn for 50 000 and a boat trip to the us rourke reluctantly agrees to do it but is seen by a priest hoskins and confesses the crime to him in the confessional in order to keep the priest s mouth shut he figures it is better than killing him a wealth of things arise here which just don t add up 1 why pick rourke to off your competition as is illustrated by a scene whereby an employee is pinned to a wall by a couple of heavies with what look like awls these london guys are tough enough anyway to do their own killing 2 not only that but the mobster gets a guy to follow rourke and witness the killing with his own eyes why didn t that guy simply kill the competitor and save all the hassle of dealing with rourke 3 hoskins sees the murder take place and the police let him go off without protection i may add to take confession no way 4 rourke hangs around the church right next to where he carried out the murder immediately after the crime takes place to go to confession why aren t the cops checking the place out 5 rourke hangs around the church and hoskin s blind niece in particular for days afterwards without anybody bothering him what he s on the run and he stays put by the very place where he committed another murder stupid 6 the cops actually meet rourke in the church fixing the organ and have no idea who he is do they not know he is on the run for the school bus bombing they don t even check up on him 7 why get rourke to kill for you and then tell him to wait around for a few days to get on the boat you d think you d want to get rid of him immediately or kill him one or the other 8 why does bates brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the midst of all the waiting could he not restrain himself for a few days at least until rourke has been safely offed to the states ridiculous 9 rourke suddenly has inner turmoil after all his years of killing and wins over the blind niece immediately even after she knows he is a killer she still loves him again utterly ludicrous and besides she falls in love with him in record time a few days 10 the whole bomb thing at the end is just plain silly from bates point of view 11 things happen in parts of this film that just do not make sense or are simply in there to help the storyline and i say that in jest along bates houses rourke in a whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail and rourke suddenly displays a moral high ground to respect the whore in the house but yet will bed a blind girl 12 rourke asks a henchman on the boat where bates is and the henchman practically spurts out the entire movements of his boss in less than 10 seconds it was embarrassing the guy was telling rourke far more than he even asked 13 hoskin s priest is an ex army guy and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub totally uncalled for and yet another cringe worthy scene i m gonna stop there at unlucky 13 without mentioning rourke s hair so falsely red it is laughable his accent which to be fair is not too bad sometimes but deteriorates to a barely heard mumble at other times his clothes walk looks to the heavens etc nor will i mention the music and the choppy editing style oooppps i have just mentioned them overall a disaster of a film with some obvious religious imagery thrown in rourke on the cross preaching from a pulpit which would embarrass a first year film student never mind a top star and director 4 10,0
5373,ha ha first of if you ve never seen a dimension film your in for a real treat known primarily for super low budget horror slasher films beowulf was no exception however this video was more in the style of ultra cheesy i missed the k r a f t label on the side consider the anachronisms something out of place and time we had candles armour swords yet we saw telescopes soled shoes cigarette lighters loudspeakers electricity body bags aluminum foil tins and spoons forks not bad for something that takes place in like the 8th century this is not a horror film is a horrible film its very laughable its really a comedy made to look like a horror film i couldn t stop laughing christopher lambert the highlander series must have really taken a tumble in his career if he s working for dimension films i ve learned my lesson though i ll be looking at the film studios on the videos a lot more closely now rated no reels out of five if you want a good laugh though its hard to pass up on this piece of work this move had some cleavage in spots i especially liked the blonde bimbette wayno,0
3775,reading the other two comments i had to wonder if i had seen the same movie perhaps life is drastically different in australia but wow call it sci fi or fantasy but people just don t act like this i couldn t pass up this review without commenting on it myself it gets better after the first half hour but i doubt most could make it that far yikes,0
17650,he is very good in this role as a disaffected and bored husband a decorated air force officer who becomes bored with his predictable suburban life and decides to make a radical change one evening he meets karen sillas an attractive woman younger than his current wife a relationship develops and cole decides to take it to the next level not only does he have an affair he fakes his death to escape his family obligations lies become increasingly more of a pattern as he begins to rob banks to keep his new wife sillas happy and to project the image that he is a success a fictional delusion apparently this was also based on a true story which makes it all the more intriguing cole is believable and excellent in these roles recommended 8 10,1
11000,spoiler wolfcreek meets texas chainsaw massacre if you ve seen those don t waste your time with this one typical slasher movie nothing new here except for the spoiler visions which just add fluff to an already weak plot i would recommend this movie if you have absolutely nothing to watch and it s either see this movie or stare at a bare wall for 1 5 hrs the only semi interesting part spoiler is when the chick starts drinking in the empty sheriff s office i say it s interesting because at least she made good use of that liquor instead of stereotypically using it to start a fire to kill the bad guy although she did go that route towards the end all in all lame bad and not worth effort,0
17900,this is s superbly crafted top notch washington thriller directed by the talented wolfgang petersen with hotshot screenwriter jeff maguire who seems to have done very little over the years so maybe he tends his roses the film has clint eastwood as an ageing secret service agent and john malkovich as a vengeful assassin pitted against each other in a massive test of wills and ingenuity where the president s life is at stake unnecessary secrecy and competition between rival security agencies almost dooms the president which is an authentic touch this film was made when both eastwood and malkovich were at their peak probably eastwood has never done a better job than he does here and it is all so effortless for the old pro there are some wonderful sound effects of him huffing and puffing as he runs along beside the president s car as a bodyguard for which he is too old i wonder if anyone else noticed the humour of those noises having been added my guardian angel whose name is vigil enjoyed this movie even more than i did but then bodyguard movies are very much his thing rene russo was a perfect choice for the female agent who falls for eastwood as she is so unobvious but so talented and she shines the tension is taut every inch of the way in this story and the psychological struggles of eastwood to redeem himself from an earlier protection failure are beautifully shown by his typical understated acting with eastwood if he lifts an eyebrow by a millimeter watch out of course he is the master of the super cool malkovich has the opportunity to indulge all the creepiness he could wish in the paranoid character he portrays and he captures the man s central vanity to perfection what a good un,1
21388,wow it s even better than i expected the best animated ast rix movie ever and it feels so good to hear roger carel doing the voice of ast rix again i surely recommend it to everyone who likes the comic books of ast rix but i suggest that you go to see the french version cause it surely is the best and you hear the original cast did you know that roger carel has played ast rix for nearly forty years i think he did a marvelous job and the song from c line dion at the end fits rally good to the end credits the music is good the drawings are good the actors are wonderful in a word a masterpiece go to see it you will not regret this,1
22956,this review contains some small yet significant spoilers i just finished watching my copy of noroi and it was great this might sound cheesy but several times during the film i forgot it wasn t real xd the acting is convincing although the acting from masafumi kobayashi playing himself i think seems a bit hokey at times marika matsumoto yuka in takashi shimizu s rinne seemed to change levels of believability throughout the movie sometimes she s really good then the next moment she s really cheesy especially at the end s exorcism and subsequent re possession a character that was ridiculous at first was mr hori a man covered in tinfoil believing ectoplasmic worms are coming to eat everyone he provides unintentional comic relief at the beginning acting like the stereotypical alien abduction type victim but near the end has some really creepy scenes the plot was very interesting and really kept me wondering how everything tied together there are some things that aren t really explained like a mass suicide in a tokyo park and where the reincarnated kagutaba boy came from but everything else turned out fine the ending has got to be one of the most unnerving if not the scariest sequences i ve ever had the pleasure to witness all in all noroi is a very fun way to spend 2 hours and the new hong kong r3 dvd provides great picture and sound most importantly the english subtitles engrish free for a great j horror experience i highly recommend picking it up,1
23919,in an industry dominated by men and in lack of products with a female mark on it is it always nice to see a film shown from the woman s point of view i would welcome more films from female writers and directors and i think lots of other women with me,1
18674,this is one of my favorite horror films of all time and i used to think it never really got its due that is until i read the glowing reviews here it seems many feel the same as i did when i first saw it it s a damn creepy film and i ve spent most of my life watching creepy films i ve always found dolls mannequins and such damn creepy check out the dolls in beyond the door and of course the great trilogy of terror and what about the magnificent twilight zone episode living doll hell dolls are creepy and tourist trap has some moments that will make your hair stand on the back of your neck all aided by an excellent soundtrack that just makes connors performance even more heart pounding i remember seeing the trailer to this film on late night tv and thing wow i gotta see that it was memorable and it s one of the only trailers i remember seeing as a kid that creeped me out took me years to see it but it was a treat stephen king also mentions this film in his danse macabre book and gives it a glowing recommendation pretty good company this film will always be high on my list of must sees it s a real solid addition to the genre of the time and deserves place alongside the best of the 70s schlockers,1
9184,were it not for the fact that this came as a 2 dvd set paired with the original american graffiti were it not for the fact that i ve been here in iraq for several months and at this point will watch pretty much anything i would have tossed this movie in the garbage after the first ten minutes this movie was appallingly bad on so many levels i just don t know where to start poorly acted shot directed written scored edited my 9 year old daughter s first forays into film making are superior to this and she was filming the dog sleeping come to think of it i give that piece of cinematography 9 stars but i m biased if you have even the slightest appreciation for quality film making then avoid this piece of garbage at all costs no character in this movie has a single redeeming quality save for the icelandic girl who doesn t even have a single line in english i ll not waste more of my time describing what a bad movie this is,0
6938,lucille ball tries to look 30 years younger than she actually was in this poor excuse for a musical the movie features some of the worst choreography ever seen laced with the constant threat that lucy might break into song with her bourbon voice at any moment lucy s total lack of talent as a singer and dancer sinks the film before it can begin and aside from die hard lucy fans no one is likely to fancy it very much bad costumes and cheesy set designs don t help further proof that lucy wasn t good at anything except making stupid faces directed by gene saks,0
21080,ok so it can be done we have here the perfect vampire movie gothic beautiful with all the ingredients a realistic vampire a wonderful story take note i am from transylvania and i assure you this movie respects the vampire lore it s exactly like the tales i heard in my childhood for a transylvanian it is quite believable you must see it if you are interested by real vampires as they were depicted in medieval chronicles and not how are they done in recent hollywood movies as far as i can guess the hollywood problem is they mix vampires with the incubus which is pretty hilarious for me vampires are never good looking or attractive they can inspire only horror and repulsion the incubus called in my country the night flier is the one beautiful demon which kills his victims by loving them i strongly recommend this for any gothic person out there see also the sequels they are all 4 very good and of course don t miss dark shadows something similar is nosferatu in venice with klaus kinski i recommend that one to,1
16508,it s not real flashy but this movie does a great job of developing a large cast of characters and letting you know their hopes and desires while still managing to be both funny and bittersweet a very sweet movie fun also to see vincent d onofrio and mary louise parker so early in their careers,1
7330,a bad movie but with one reel that is worth savoring for most of the film the jokes are bad the songs are bad even w c fields is bad then there is one sequence with bob hope and his movie ex the dialogue is witty and the song a version of thanks for the memories light cynical and delightful who parachuted in for this one bit yet it makes the whole thing worth the original 25 cents admission,0
12115,believe it or not this was at one time the worst movie i had ever seen since that time i have seen many more movies that are worse how is it possible therefore to be fair i had to give this movie a 2 out of 10 but it was a tough call,0
4300,okay i haven t read the book yet but i have to say that the lead character was miscast how can i say such a thing haven t read the book you ask it s simple as a viewer of this miniseries i grew irritated by the mannerisms gestures and look of the lead character fannie price it s one thing to be a good person but it s quite another to be a stick in the mud creature who disdains from looking anyone in the face or otherwise meeting their gaze apart from the overdone susan b anthony profile she seemed resolute in refusing to look at another person the scene where edmond is pouring his heart out to her she is looking straight ahead the whole time forcing him to do the same as a result it was just awkward and i just couldn t fathom anyone being in love with her let alone both henry and edmond many have said it was true to the book if that is the case i find it hard to believe that jane austen would create such a character as her lead heroine it s possible to create a character who has been put upon by others and succeeds in earning their trust and endearment but the portrayal of this character in this miniseries just didn t do it for me,0
14342,i was a huge fan of this series yesterday i watched it again on dvd i was apprehensive about whether laughs would come or not but in a few episodes i was laughing hysterically and some episodes were good acting wise rakesh bedi raja satish shah is brilliant whereas swaroop sampat is plain bad but i think she gets the job done maybe a better actress could have been used in place of her this series shows what good clean comedy is if this series were to air in the current year i would have given it 9 10 and to think that this series is almost 25 years old and its comedy is still good i give it 10 10 i would highly recommend this series for watching on dvd,1
3157,a ridiculous movie a terrible editing job worst screenplay ridiculous acting a story that is completely ununderstandable if god was going to decide if movies should continue to be done judging by this one the entire world movie industry would now be dead a wonderful movie to show that cinema should not be done by people who think they can make movies i am still wondering who are those two gipsy girls who show up in the movie for over half an hour and are never introduced to us,0
1895,this is the first and as far as i can tell the only completed production of heart of darkness ever released prior to starting on citizen kane orson welles shot some test footage for a version of heart of darkness that was to be filmed entirely in what would now be called pov where we would see everything from the point of view of the main character charlie marlow he would be seen only fleetingly in mirrors windows water etc the film was never made the pov technique was used not too successfully in 1947 in the lady in the lake with robert montgomery starring as philip marlowe presumably the coincidence of the two marlow e characters is just that of course francis coppola s apocalypse now was based on heart of darkness the short novel heart of darkness by the polish born british writer joseph conrad first serialized in a british literary magazine in 1899 features one of his favorite alter egos ship captain charlie marlow who also narrates the short story youth and indirectly tells the story of lord jim marlow temporarily out of work decides to take a job captaining a river boat for a belgian company involved in the brutal exploitation of the resources of king leopold ii s personal fiefdom the cruelly misnamed congo free state marlow travels from london to brussels signs on with the company and is told that his mission is to take a boat up the congo river to a far inland station headed by one of the company s most productive agents in the colony a german named kurtz shipments of ivory latex for the production of rubber and other products from kurtz s station have ceased and no word has come downriver from kurtz for some time there are rumors that he has gone native marlow is to investigate take any necessary action and make a report on his return he takes passage down the west african coast to the mouth of the congo is delayed for weeks while he is forced to repair his boat at the company station on the coast and finally sets out upriver to find kurtz s station the river the heat the vegetation the wildlife the insects the people all take their toll on his endurance his imagination and his mental resources he finds kurtz ill half mad and close to death the final encounter and the death of kurtz are almost an anticlimax especially since conrad is so obscure about what actually happens that we are left to puzzle it out for ourselves this is a novel where you close the book vaguely dissatisfied with the ending but nevertheless treasuring the story for its amazing atmospherics this heart of darkness was filmed with guyana in central america standing in for west africa it is best where the novel is at its greatest disadvantage actually showing us first world urbanites what a boat trip up a tropical river would look like but the rest of the film was forgettable tim roth does his best as marlow but so much about the plot characterizations and character relationships has been altered beyond recognition that you wonder why they bothered if the aim was to make conrad s story for the screen why didn t they leave it alone it s unreasonable to expect that no compromises will be made when a book is made into a movie but so many changes were made that to me had no cinematic justification that you wonder whether we are simply dealing with incompetent screenwriters and cinematographers most disappointing of all was john malkovich as kurtz he was completely miscast and simply flubs the role everything about him is wrong his looks his acting style his voice his accent everything a vastly better choice would have been someone like bruno ganz unlike malkovich an actual german like the character this is a very disappointing production and i would recommend it only after you ve read the book if you want to depend on more than your imagination to get a visual picture of a boat trip up the congo river circa 1900,0
24721,this is one of the better sci fi series it involves character development a few really tensionate moments and reasonable episode scripts as one other commentator said here it looked as if it were a mini series not a full blown series with filler episodes and low budgets the problem with the show which in short is a godzilla series is that it started too big with incredible monsters fantastic science then it all boiled down to local americans doing stuff then the show ended too soon since the olympics were coming and hey a sci fi show is a sci fi show but half naked athletic people running around aimlessly is much more important so they only did 15 episodes instead of the expected 22 the audience was small too as people didn t really caught it on at 20 00 in the end the suits did it trust a marketing plan to destroy anything that looks remotely original and promising conclusion you have a show with good special effects stuff like huge monsters killing people or destroying boats then going into genetic engineering transforming people human clones end of the world tsunamis also the only fillers are scenes with aggressive rednecks or other annoying people being killed for their stupidity the down side is that after 15 episodes that prepare something huge the show ends no real ending no closure just a bitter taste of cloth in one s mouth as if you just swallowed a piece of suit,1
10049,this is one of those strange self important self indulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound it isn t instead it spouts cliches that try to pass for profundity typical is the scene where peter kelsey grammer explains to protagonist and best friend adam dwier brown how man starts life breast feeding then moves on to sucking the breast of his girlfriend and finally his wife thus concluding ultimately that life sucks so deep we are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective of life the universe etc during adam s travels through the mojave desert on foot he abruptly leaves l a the day of his wedding and his family friends and fiance assume he s dead when his car was found in a military test range smashed by a rocket some characters are more entertaining than others the best by far is an escapee from a mental hospital who only speaks through the voices of others the actor james kevin ward does some great impressions including nicholson popeye and several characters from the original star trek but once the interesting characters leave the screen we re stuck with adam again and his pursuit of the profound it s a long trip which drags in many places in fact it s the longest hour and a half movie i ve ever seen and the finale hardly makes it seem worth while at all i discovered this movie playing on hbo one day by waking up too early and clicking on the tv that ll learn me next time i ll try harder to sleep in,0
12684,while watching this film recently i constantly had to remind myself that it was made in 1957 and in the ussr that makes it all the more remarkable many of the cinematographic effects in the film seem cliched in 2002 but they were quite original in 1957 i first saw this film in 1963 when it was first released in the us and i was struck by its originality then now just having seen it 40 years later i have no reason to change my mind,1
22132,does exactly what you expect and then some the first movie was a step up from the tv show with sicker stunts airing uncensored and a gnarly factor that had increased surprisingly jackass number two is even more twisted the stunts have become more dangerous and spectacular with some mind blowing painful antics sprinkled with good fun skits to keep that smile turning into a curl of disgust knoxville like always dominates the proceedings but this time he has reason to take centre stage as he volunteers for the most dangerous and idiotic of all the stunts with bam magera also proving himself as wild as ever despite having had his image toned down in viva la bam surprisingly the infamous wild boys steve o and chris pontius seem to take part in fewer of the skits despite being focal in the previous outings if you like jackass or dirty sanchez then you will definitely enjoy this film and will laugh your guts out for the 100 minutes of its duration if you see it as childish disgusting or a sad snapshot of the youth culture of today you will find it as offencive as ever so f k off,1
3818,it hasn t even been two years since i first saw this film and yet i can barely remember a thing about this movie needless to say i found it to be very forgettable of what i do remember nothing stands out as particularly good a talented cast is wasted in what i suppose was meant to be a dark comedy but if that is the case it fails miserably at best this film is mildly interesting at worst the seemingly omnipresent overcast skies are more interesting than the storyline if you like watching films where it always seems damp and cool then i guess you may find something to like in this picture just try to ignore what else is going on because it is barely watchable,0
5401,sure the concept had already been done with alf and the charmings thrust modern society onto one or more out of place characters but i loved both shows and watched them religiously until they ended in 1990 when i learned about scorch i was actually very hopeful for something new as new tv in the 90 s so far hadn t impressed me but at least star trek tng and the simpsons were still going what i got was a big disappointment the acting was awful but considering the ridiculous dialogue and wholly unbelievable writing i can t blame them too much for what they had to work with there were a few humorous moments but most of the deliberate jokes seemed forced in their delivery the whole production work on the show seemed too low budget for what was on tv at the time in the 80 s it would have fit right in still it was the first episode and had to introduce the characters and establish the entire premise of the series so i gave it the benefit of the doubt the second episode wasn t as bad and i started to get my hopes back that once it got into its stride the show would improve sadly my vcr ended up not recording the third episode aired i never got to see it and the series disappeared from the tv listings after that all i have now are the first two episodes recorded off the air onto a vhs tape,0
22880,stephane audran is the eponymous heroine of this beautifully measured study of a small danish community towards the end of the last century two beautiful and musically talented sisters give up their own prospects of happiness and marriage in order to look after their ageing father one day a french woman babette comes to work for them after some years she wins the lottery and is determined to do something for the sisters who have taken her in her solution is to prepare an exquisite and sumptuous feast which changes the lives of all those invited this is a film about human and cultural interaction reflected in the changing language of the dialogue from danish to french and especially between the dutiful sobriety of protestant northern europe and the sensuousness of the catholic south it is also about human needs and how warmth and kindness can be expressed and stimulated through the cultivation of the senses a profoundly uplifting film,1
8335,an art teacher comes across an antique wooden bed made from gingko trees and puts it in his apartment but it has a terrible history and he becomes hunted by a ancient spirit who sustains his human form by ripping the hearts out of people this beautifully crafted horror well actually it s more fantasy romance than anything else does raise some chills and provide some stunning visuals but the plot was hardly interesting enough and the formulaic script lacked any sort of life problem was that i spent most of the time trying to keep my finger away from the fast forward button it sure would have sped up the film s slow pacing but then again i wouldn t know about too much that was going on which was reasonably hard to figure out or keep interest in the first place the performances ranged from too melodramatic or just plain dull and that s probably because these characters are unconvincing stale and coma inducing the actual back story of the old bed and the spirits is incredibly boring and messily put together with too much focus on a flimsy romance being laughable when it shouldn t be and overall it s constructed in an ordinary manner that just lacks the oomph or conviction to carry the film what compensates for the story s shortcomings are really arty images which looked grand but the use of some images had me somewhat dumbfounded to what they actually mean towards the film what catches your eye is the faded colour scheme but sometimes the actual screen would look real grainy or snowy although from that it shows the raw intensity of the production valves but also add some nice polished effects that goes well with the soothing but sometimes edgy score the camera work was pretty diverse although it didn t add too much to the feature but during some of the more upbeat scenes there were too many close ups or dark lighting which made it hard to understand what you are seeing also on show are some nice moments of blood and gore but not overtly grand or distinguishable from most other films lethargically odd film with luminous images that look like something out of a painting but still it isn t particularly enticing watch out it might put you in a deep trance,0
4426,i really wanted to like this film for all sorts of reasons the subject matter is inherently interesting and is probably the major issue facing the world today and has thrown up fascinating works e g linda grant s when i lived in modern times usually from the israeli side of the fence also a bloke i like told me he thought it was the best film he d seen all year so with such a recommendation however i actually found myself nodding off at points admittedly i was tired and the cinema seats comfy but i found it too much hard work trying to identify with the characters once i d got my head round the idea that it was a series of vignettes i went with it but this made it disappointingly like a sketch show rather than a film i liked the concept of a restrained almost silent mise en scene contrasted to these utopian moments the sexy girl the red balloon and the ninja muslim fighter but personally i think the film has been over hyped i m not saying narrative and plot is everything it s definitely not but even a little more dialogue would have helped,0
19117,i ve seen a fair few films from the far east recently some were excellent battle royale infernal affairs the eye and some were not so great versus the triple cross then there are ones like uzumaki and returner which while flawed i still enjoyed the basic premise involves the mysterious and horrific effects that a growing obsession with spirals has upon a community sound silly yeah thats what i was thought firstly the good stuff direction was top notch sure a bit over the top in places but never the less interesting and stylish secondly the story was original and like other writers commented very lovelace esq it was interesting what it reminded me most of however was early cronenberg films like shivers and videodrome the acting wasn t great but not too horrible either to be honest i was actually bored on a few occations i felt the pacing especially initially was a little slow my main problem was that it was too silly and funny to be true horror and yet not so enough to be considered a comedy spoilers below spoilers some good scenes washing machine and i liked the final shot voiceover at first i thought it ended far too abruptly but about 20 seconds later i realised the meaning and liked the end however because of the lack of seriousness in the story combined with over the top scenes such as the news report at the school ment that i did not care for the characters much in the end the final scene which was perhaps supposed to be a little poignent while in reality i couldn t really care for the girl or her boyfriend spoilers end so overall i kinda did like this film but it frustrated me and i think there was real potential in addition to some good scenes couple of other points the main girl is quite pretty and cute and the song that plays at the end is good too i rated it 7 10,1
14317,i find this film meretricious tentative lethargic and skillfully a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid but i admire the courage to throw away a script turn the camera on and act a fool i find the inauspiciously performances lighting cinematography sound and whatever film school laws d urville martin broke funny speaking from a film directors perspective there is times i just want to drop everything and have fun on the set this film looks like fun when other aspiring film directors ask me advice i just tell them to watch any film by rudy ray moore they always return a puzzled look asking me why not watch the masters woody allen scorsese lucas capra i laugh and include that you always want to know what not to do in cinematic story telling first,1
13626,add this little gem to your list of holiday regulars it issweet funny and endearing,1
19069,i remember when skateboarding had it s rebirth in the 70s i begged my parents for money to by a second hand skateboard from a friend it was a piece of junk complete with clay wheels and everything i also remember reading skateboarder magazine and being both completely impressed and totally terrified of the dogtown crew skating never became a way of life for me but in some ways it has always been a part of my life whether it is using a board for transportation or just having a bunch of friends that skate this film is a brilliant documentary of the real birth of modern day skating watching this crew turn skating from the flat boring hobby it was into the vertical lifestyle it has become had me sitting slack jawed for 90 minutes it s amazing that enough footage from this period still exists to have created this film and thank god for that the footage is brilliant it gave me the feeling of watching an old buster keaton film i ve seen some of the tricks keaton did repeated countless times in other films since then but when you go back and see the first person to perform that trick it s amazing that not only were they the first person to try it successfully but that they lived through it and made it seem effortless that s the feeling this film gave me yeah i ve seen people skate pools before but to watch the first people skating pools and inventing the tricks that eventually became the basics of modern skating is like watching the facade of the house fall on keaton leaving him standing safely in the frame of a window it s absolutely brilliant to watch something that up until that point had never been tried before but since has been tried by almost everyone this film is beautiful to watch and incredible to listen to the soundtrack is one of the best i ve ever heard in a film this is a film that will appeal to people whether they like skating or not i ve talked to a couple of friends of mine who made their girlfriends sit through this film after heavy protest and they all said that their girlfriends were mesmerized by the end of the film and loved it as much as they did as for the previous comments on this board that complain about the film being too self congratulatory i think that s an unfair disparagement i liked seeing these guys get excited about their past they created something that influenced their sport and changed it forever they have the right to pat themselves on the back they were stars for doing what they loved to do most of these guys girls never achieved the staggering success tony hawk enjoys today but that kind of success wasn t available to skaters then sure they had some success but more importantly they have been able to live a life doing what they love to do and as we see in the end almost all of them still surf skate or work in the surf skate industry how many of us can say that we have been able to live our lives and have been successful by breaking all the rules and doing what we love to do they can my hat s off to the dogtown and z boys for being themselves and changing the world of skateboarding forever,1
14973,drive was an enjoyable episode with a dark ending basically a man and his wife are infected in their inner ear by a high pitched sound wave being emitted by some military equipment some favorite parts of mine from this episode are mulder s dialogue in the car and the scene where scully goes in with the hazmat team and find the little old deaf lady completely unaffected by what they thought was a virus the ending of course is tragic in its realism because it leads the viewer to believe that they are going to actually be able to pull off this elaborate plan to save the victim but when mulder arrives the man is already dead 8 10,1
24370,contains spoilers a lovely film this starring brad renfro and the ever wonderful joseph mazzello i like joseph mazzello out of all his films i ve seen to date i ve loved every single one of them for many different reasons and the cure is no different brad renfro does very well in this movie as well the cure is a drama coming of age movie from the viewpoint of an ill child and his friend the basic idea is dexter joseph mazzello has aids he ends up befriending the kid next door brad renfro but erik s mum is very narrow minded ill informed and somewhat thick when it comes to dexter s illness she thinks aids is contagious like the common cold so doesn t want her son going anywhere near dexter after many attempts at making their own cure with no success the boys go on their way to new orleans to find the cure after reading a pamphlet about it after getting their kicks from playboy magazine dexter s health goes south shortly afterwards and as his health detoriates there s still enough life in the boy alongside erik for two pranks of pretending to stop breathing unfortunately poor dexter does indeed die from his illness leaving poor erik behind to wonder why he couldn t find the cure throughout the movie he ends up bonding more with dexter s mother than his own it is a very heartwarming movie to watch and is not absolutely perfect movies rarely are but you won t care less about that as you get involved in the film more a must for joseph mazzello fans one of his best performances ever very well recommended must see movie if you can find a copy,1
24985,this was on showtime the other night and i figured it was going to be another made for video crap fest like earth vs the spider or any of those other hbo horror shorts instead i found a comedy gore classic it was legitimately funny and surprisingly the acting was quite good even my wife an overall horror hater agreed and was laughing at parts in addition the fx were high quality overall the film felt like a parody of joy ride jeepers creepers and the 2 main characters reminded me of the pair from shaun of the dead definitely worth watching but don t take it seriously the end,1
23731,i read the comments about this movie before watching it and wasn t expecting much but as a b movie it s a curiosity i guess you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy this kind of thing but i seriously thought it was awesome people should watch it just for the experience because it s totally one of a kind don t expect much of it the acting is poor transitions were obviously done on a pc etc definitely a b movie but nonetheless really worth checking out very funny mild gore and some questionable themes so probably not something to show your gran but for the more adventurous viewer i d say it s a must see,1
4495,this movie is terrible a true hockey fan would have to assume that the people that appeared in and produced this movie never played or watched a real hockey game i got this hoping that it would be a guy movie but the only people that would probably enjoy this movie are females between the ages of 13 17 the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like they re 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc it s so difficult to predict the end of this movie though for those who have seen it who would have guessed for those that haven t seen it don t waste your time i figured it out less than halfway through the movie to call this movie a drama is ridiculous,0
17247,this is a movie about a man everybody thinks is jewish this is a movie about lawrence newman who lives in brooklyn in the 1940 s at the time of wwii one day when he gets himself glasses people start thinking he s a jew and that only because he looks like one and he lives in a very antisemitic neighborhood so some people start treating him like dirt they make that judgment being a jew of larry s fresh wife gertrude hart too that makes their lives unbearable neal slavin s focus 2001 is a fairly good look at the antisemitism that s a problem that won t go away the movie is based on athur miller s novel which i admit i haven t read but the movie is really good so i m sure the book would also the actors do good job william h macy is always good and his work as larry newman is brilliant laura dern is gert hart and she s magnificent meat loaf is almost scary as the neighbor who wants to keep jews out by any means necessary david paymer s character as the jewish shop owner mr finkelstein is the most sympathetic in the movie paymer is the perfect choice for the role one of the greatest scenes is in the end when mr finkelstein and newman fight against those nazi like people with baseball bats they join together to fight the evil the christian and the jew,1
9986,well i ll begin with this i love horror movies not even the worst plot or the most insanely terrible acting will ruin the experience as long as there is a certain amount of gore and suspense present second this is the worst movie of all times it even beats mean guns and the attack of the killer tomatoes and for that i pay it homage however the involuntary humor was only funny until half the movie had passed after which point everything was so so sad to my great surprise the reviews where somewhat divided and you guys who rated this piece of c movie crap from 7 and up i know you re joking good one hahaha because if there is any reason in the world and we have just an tiny bit of the same notion of what quality is you can t be for real everything worth to be mentioned about the contents has already been summed pretty good up so i ll leave it minor spoiler alertbut the scene where the cloaked rubber mask guy drags the woman back and forth through the dog kennel for ten minutes with o so terrible music score and the mind blowing dialog between the two really does it for me,0
7943,i m probably one of the few people who defend and even enjoy frisk the project that put todd verow on the map if that is indeed where he is i appreciated that someone had the guts to take on dennis cooper and not back away from the material verow fairly rolls around in it judging from what he s done since then he s well suited for that type of material and should probably stick to it vacationland a would be teen coming out film is so misguided in so many ways it becomes unintentional comedy and i m disappointed i have to report that first off our hero the high school senior joe is far too old in appearance to be playing 18 when we later meet a man who is supposed to be joe s teacher it s confusing as the sweaty faced guy looks much younger than the student he s teaching joe s mother looks younger than he does and doesn t act any older either second in joe s opening scenes he looked like he was either playing or actually experiencing mental challenges to his credit he got better as the film went on and i figured out he was playing young but it just wasn t working it was weird it s 15 minutes in before anything is revealed about who what and where these people are and why we should care the second scene in the film is an extended bit of business in a men s toilet room that considering where the story goes later is absolutely superfluous the subplot with the teacher goes nowhere at all even as a rite of passage for our young hero one minute joe is nervously trying his hand at bathroom stall sex a scene so un erotic it makes you truly wonder what anyone sees in the practice the next minute he s an expert at sexual blackmail and violent double crossing this is followed by an extended scene with the character we ll later learn is andrew and that s about all we learn about him other than he s apparently gay but not out yet there s a lot crammed in to the 1 44 running time which is about 20 minutes too long i can t imagine how it played with the mind numbingly long and pointless deleted scenes of joe walking around a sub plot copped from gods and monsters with an aged patron who spouts rhetoric appros pos of nothing played by an actor who obviously can t remember his lines he is conveniently dispatched with in a way dickens might have come up with on a slow week a mix n match almost four way between the boys and their girlfriends a gay bashing toilet tramp a would be wise sage in the form of a nellie queen and hasn t the nellie queen suddenly taken over the role of the hooker with the heart of gold as most tired stereo type who exists only to be degraded blackmail theft murder alcohol consumption and abuse of looping music software for soundtrack recording what you will not find in this movie are any interior establishing master shots we re expected to imagine we re in an airport grocery store office and classroom as all the scenes in these locations consist of close ups and poorly edited soundscapes to convey the idea of locales that the production must not have been able to afford one thing they were able to get appears to have been an actual gay bar either it s the worst bar in the world or there are only about 5 gay men in bangor maine as the bar never has any patrons in it another good chuckle came when the actors were supposed to be yelling over dance music that very obviously wasn t coming from the speakers but was just more of the droning loop music of the score plots and characters come and go emotions are unreadable and the dialog clearly inspired by dennis cooper is film speak meaning no humans actually talk this way since we aren t given any information about these characters it s impossible to care about what happens to them it s as if joe et al appear out of the ether one day and might simply cease to exist once the credits roll certainly the character of joe s sister a wannabee jennifer grey who is bohemia crazy seems to just simply stop we never know where she is in la or what her problem is but again does it matter visually the film looks very good at times more a testament to new developments in hi def video than anything i suspect the editing is pretty clunky though there was one great edit joe is posing naked and says i wanted to play sports but and we cut to a shot revealing his butt ha ha composition is also odd at times i thought i was watching sctv s parody of persona when the boys were talking together in bed and visually it looked as if their noses were stuck together for the whole scene one senses verow is really restraining himself from making a naughtier or somewhat rougher movie like he usually does and maybe he shouldn t have held back the frothy toothpaste sex fantasy worked nicely i thought though the tone was out of touch with the rest of the movie he produces and directs this sensitive coming of age story much like herschell gordon lewis directed films without gore porn films without sex in them i got some unintended laughs out of this and it wasn t boring it just wasn t very good either,0
20258,excellent movie in many aspects vicente aranda has succeeded in depicting the time 1830 with meticulous care the light the places the feeling are perfectly perceived from the very start of the movie and along with it in opposite to what happened to mad love juana la loca a rather episodic historical movie all of this beautiful photography music clothes is wrapping a very fluid screenplay that reaches its climax in the only possible way concerning the actors paz vega as carmen is outstanding liar seductive agressive totally sexual so beautiful carmen sbaraglia is a little less convincing the audience about his instant mad love for carmen but he succeeds in conveying the proper tragic mood to the whole movie i recommend it to everyone the best spanish movie of the year,1
14756,hilarious sellers at his funniest a shame you can t get this on video or even see it on tv anymore i d love to get a good copy somewhere maybe it s tied up in court on some legal issue but a truly riotous hospital farce with sellers as crooked administrator,1
7587,silver city 2 outta 5 stars as a huge fan of john sayles work for many years now i feel safe in saying that this is the worst movie he has ever done that said the movie isn t exactly terrible just very uninspired sayles throws in familiar elements from his previous movies corrupt politics illegal immigration the selling out of youthful ideals but fails to bring them together in any new or meaningful way even the dialogue usually sayles strong point is disappointing this time around sounding clich d and forced in almost every scene the movie looks and sounds like episodes from a tv series that didn t make it past its third episode there are tons of big stars on hand and they try their best to make their bit parts come alive but the material just isn t there this time around while filming a campaign spot a governor hopeful a poor and obvious george w bush stand in fishes a dead body out of a lake an investigator is hired to try and warn away people who may have deliberately set this up to discredit the candidate but he soon finds out that there are deeper and darker and more clich d secrets to be discovered sayles has made similarly themed movies so much better in the past lone star matewan return of the secaucus seven men with guns it s a shame that he went to the well one time too many and came up with tainted water one good line delivered by richard dreyfuss danny you re a loser that s already been established beyond doubt so just try and be a good one okay,0
24357,unbelievably close to real life feelings and emotions captured by joseph mazzello as a hemophiliac child affected by aids and his new young neighbor a wanna be tough redneck played to perfection by brad renfro although the story may seem slightly farfetched the two boys attempt to river raft several hundred miles to find a doctor who claims to have the cure to aids the emotion actions and interactions of all characters involved are tragically close to real life being a big brother to a boy in a similar situation who died a few years after this film was released i strongly recommend this picture to anyone who has ever wondered what really happens in the life of a child with aids superb direction by peter horton creates the perfect mood and setting for each scene and draws the viewer into the various emotions affected by friendship illness prejudice and the final parting of two friends who fought hard to overcome adversity,1
23978,the missing star who competed for the golden lion at 2006 venice film festival is a film that when you think about the first adjective that comes to your mind is intense intense looks intense sequences this movie s intensity captures the viewer since the very first scenes at the steelworks in italy i couldn t recognize the city maybe genoa or even naples although the pace is quite slow vincenzo buonavolont the male lead and with him all the audience sees a completely different china than a normal westerner imagines horrible high rise building with about 8 hundred flat owners inside skyscrapers desolation fog scrapers and cranes everywhere but also the beauty of the yangtze kiang river that will soon become a big lake because of the controversial dike that will wipe a lot of towns out china is a country under construction but under all these colossal public works there are still poverty backwardness and unfair laws we can relate more easily to this story because gianni amelio the expert director chose two phenomenal leads sergio castellitto a well known actor in italy and the chinese surprise tai ling a total unknown girl that gives an as intense interpretation as castellitto s the film is not perfect there are some flaws here and there but that doesn t mean it s a mediocre film try to see it,1
190,hair the movie based on the broadway hit fails to achieve any redeemable cinematic qualities you cant really take the play and make it a movie whether one is so tempted by the rock music to see this movie it really detracts from the quality of a broadway show worse than seeing sitcom reruns musical fiasco and cant believe others rated it so high,0
8415,comparisons to the original series are inevitable it s a shame diana rigg left the original show in the 1960 s due to mistreatment on the part of the producers and macnee probably regretted this as much as any fan there s no telling how long the show might have lasted otherwise linda thorson was ok as a replacement and her episodes still retained almost all of the quality and aspects of the rigg episodes only the rigg macnee chemistry was lacking the new avengers should have been left on the shelf a declining macnee an annoying purdey and a who the hell is this guy gambit also the humor was forced and poor granted i only watched a few of the episodes because that was all i could watch but i think i got the idea try as many might and do it s nearly impossible to resurrect an old show as a new format or movie,0
24528,i think it was a pretty good film it shows how someone grew up in an environment that created a rich and powerful man but unfortunately because of his ambition and the people around him it led to his destruction it shows that you can t trust anyone especially in a world that deals with a lot of money and envy the character that i mostly liked was sebeva she was another ambitious powerful and ruthless woman in a man s world who loved and respected kilo she also knew that business was business and a dangerous one everything she did was risky but got the job done she helped kilo become rich with her connections overall i really liked this film and have it in my collection and waiting for el padrino 2,1
13951,rowan atkinson s creation mr bean has stood the test of time and will be forever etched upon the memory of those who viewed it living alone and appearing not to have a job of any description mr bean goes around doing day to day activities in a rather comedic fashion the mistake prone mr bean induces heartfelt laughter when put even in the most simplest situations though he barely spoke any coherent words his jovial actions more than made up for this even when driving in his beloved mini mr bean still manages to cause inadvertent chaos not very much is known about his background but his ability to draw tears of laughter from the audience at his funny shenanigans is well known before he found fame nick hancock can be seen in a couple of the episodes,1
12760,this is one of alfred hitchcock s best films and one of his most underrated i believe it certainly exceeds a psycho or the birds for technical artistry and brilliance it is a macabre tense darkly humorous product that will leave you in awe for quite some time robert walker creates one of hitchcock s most memorable villains as the father hating mother fixated but aren t most of hitchcock s villains mummy s boys bruno it is a disturbing stunning performance that illuminates the whole film his character is obsessive apparently homosexual look at those deliberately effeminate ties and hear how he is described as european strangely charming and dangerous to cross farley granger certainly knows this as he becomes entangled in bruno s sordid web after the pair meet on a train bruno knowing some inside information on guy s affairs proposes the two swap murders for each other s benefit walker will kill granger s slutty conniving wife who is inhibiting his marriage to beautiful anne whilst granger will murder bruno s father who he so intensely hates everyone s happy right a win win as bruno asserts wrong granger forgets about the indecent proposal but an obsessed walker doesn t he commits his murder and is determined to hound granger until he completes his side of the bargain too strangers becomes a riveting suspenseful game of cat and mouse in hitch s capable hands hitchcock was absolutely amazing at creating intriguing minor characters and building scenes we have the whore miriam granger s estranged wife pregnant to another man she lasciviously slurps a phallic ice cream cone whilst openly eating up bruno with her eyes barbara morton anne s sister is a deceptively sweet yet smart and cunning young girl who comes out with the most crude remarks you ll hear from a bespectacled girl in the pictures in the 50 s senator morton is authoritative and self absorbed this is one of the most daring films hitchcock ever made and it is typical to a hitch film subtly sexual in detail this fits into the film noir category with it s focus on murder lies and deceit and shadowy cinematography walker s nut is one for the ages and granger makes a convincing troubled protagonist roman is perhaps weaker than the other two and i never believed her relationship with granger still the overwhelming positives cancel out the slight negatives and it can be safely said that this is one of the best american films ever made just look at what hitch does here the originality the technical skill we see the murder of miriam reflected in her shattered glasses a game of tennis turns into one of the most thrilling intense scenes you ll ever see a innocent fairground turns into a place of murder and foul occurrences a young boy s balloon is popped callously by walker hitch obviously liked what he saw in the third man children s delight at riding the carousel turns into screaming fast paced terror hitch subverts normal everyday events like no other the camera work here is among the best ever seen in a hitchcock film and the premise is to die for it s slick oozes sophistication and devilish charm the cross cutting between walker and granger s characters is magnificent granger s do or die tennis match is just as vital as villain walker s rescue of an incriminating piece of evidence lost down a drain hitch again build his villain into a nasty repulsive yet sympathetic and oddly charming did anyone else find him strangely attractive more so than granger piece of work we are just as tense as walker in our hope that he can get the lighter out of the drain we need him to anyway he holds the key to the story you ll never view an approach from a stranger in the same way again after seeing this film amazing 10 10,1
16564,what a movie i have always liked the asian style of shooting and this movie does not disappoint at all photography is breath taking ranging from amazing landscapes to whirls of colours the main actor is really realistic in representing the painter whose paintings are astonishing the ending is also very well chosen very poetic the only remark is that they should have maybe shown a bit more deeply the connection between his inspiration and his abuse of alcohol and women but altogether this is an excellent film,1

13987,the man with a golden arm was one of a trio of great films around that same time that dealt with drug addiction the other two were monkey on my back and a hatful of rain but i think of the three this one is the best maybe if otto preminger had shot the thing in the real chicago instead of those obvious studio sets the film might have been better yet who knows maybe preminger couldn t get enough money to pay for the location it s the only flaw i find in the film frank sinatra is a heroin addicted card dealer who was busted for covering for his boss robert strauss when the game was raided he took the cure while in jail and wants a new life as a jazz drummer but a whole lot of people are conspiring against him first bob strauss who wants him back dealing especially because a couple of heavyweight gamblers are in town he uses a few underhanded methods to get sinatra s services back secondly darren mcgavin is the local dope dealer who wants sinatra good and hooked as a customer again and finally eleanor parker his clinging wife who s working a con game to beat all just to keep him around frank sinatra got a nomination for best actor for this film but lost to ernest borgnine in marty sinatra might have won for this one if he hadn t won for from here to eternity in the supporting actor category a few years back and that marty was such an acclaimed film in that year his scenes going through withdrawal locked up in kim novak s apartment will leave you shaken eleanor parker does not get enough credit for her role she s really something as the crazy scheming wife who wants sinatra tied to her no matter what the cost if she had not been nominated that same year for interrupted melody she might have been nominated for this 1955 marked the high point of her career darren mcgavin got his first real notice as the very serpentine drug peddler his performance is guaranteed to make your flesh crawl elmer bernstein contributed a great jazz score to accentuate the general dinginess of the bleak chicago neighborhood the characters live in not a place you d want to bring up your family,1
15549,i liked this movie i wasn t really sure what it was about before i started watching it but enjoyed it nonetheless it was about a girl meredith monroe whose mom didn t want her to turn out like she did she meets and falls in love with a boy riley smith who is town for a charity football game it s a good movie i just hope it will be on again or comes out on video,1
17464,as an american fan of the league of gentlemen i had to wait months to finally see this film when it came out on dvd but it was well worth the excruciating wait apocalypse is fantastic funny freaky clever as hell full of in jokes and cryptic references to the television series basically everything you d expect from the gentlemen the plot has already been discussed in other reviews so i won t bother re capping it although i will say when i first read it i was a bit hesitant obviously this device fictional characters entering the real world to confront their makers has been used before notably in wes craven s underrated new nightmare and stephen king s dark tower books where king himself was a character the gentlemen have fun breaking the fourth wall though and even add a new element a second fictional world them days soon all three realities have weaved together and the result is exhilarating geoff tipps being knighted in the middle ages and trying to court queen victoria wood the real league of gentlemen in royston vasey being confronted by characters like pauline and dr chinnery david warner summoning an homunculus outside of bernice s church i ve heard that some people disliked the king s evil sub plot but i found it hilarious especially reece s character who seemed to be channeling judith the witch from series three speaking of the characters i was relieved to find that although hilary briss geoff and herr lipp were planted firmly in at the film s core other more familiar characters were given their due bernice s confessional in the beginning was hilarious hearkening back to the quicker more sketch oriented feel of the first series pauline and mickey have cameos no ross though strange although i would ve loved to ve seen more of ms campbell jones papa lazarou is accounted for as are tubbs and edward all three are used very sparingly giving their meager screen time an almost magical feel and just what the hell did papa hack up like an obscene hairball according to the dvd commentary a wad of greasy pubic hair the film looks incredible but then what s new the music as always is breathtaking i was thrilled to hear joby talbot s new interpretations of the theme music and his slight re working of the majestic lovely piece that closes out both apocalypse and the last episode of series three i have some minor complaints it would have been nice to see more of the old familiar royston vasey and i felt the stop motion creatures beautiful by the way were a bit underused both of these issues however can be justified by the film s budget so they re understandable still as much as i loved bernice s new church it would have been cool to see the final battle in the high street the gentlemen s original vision according to the commentary overall apocalypse is astounding especially if you re a fan of the series i can t recommend it highly enough 10 10,1
7629,this movie was so bad and so cheap and so corny i found this movie to be one of the most boring slow paced early 80 s movies that i have ever seen i like most 80 s cheap horror movies but i would never rent this one again it just did not make any sense a family that lives in the woods invites their son his wife and their daughter to spend time with them for the holidays and during the movie for some reason the mother and daughter in law do not get along well we never figure out why until almost till the end of the movie but until then all we see is the fact that the mother has some form of esp and the daughter in law is having nightmares and flashbacks of a catastrophe of what will happen to unfortunate victims to this thing that we have no clue as to what it looks like all we see is a bright light signaling his approach and all we hear is a cheap interpretation of darth vadar voices and a soundtrack stolen from various horror movies then when we finally find out what and who it is all i did was laugh this killer turns out to be some kind of alien japanese warrior from ww2 who has apparently come back to life to claim the mother and her family and all the mother does is stand there in front of the living room shaking with her hands on fire or something like she s going into some kind of convulsion this movie is pathetic avoid it it s not even worth renting,0
24359,very nice movie i was browsing the channels on my tv and i usually ignore the channels that air drama movies but then i saw this channel that airs old school movies and it is where i saw this movie at first when i saw the title the cure i thought it s gonna be boring but then i got hooked when i saw brad renfro was in this movie because of one of my favorite movie of all time is the client where brad also stars then the scenes was getting better and better the story is so beautiful and very touching i cried hard in this movie which i don t usually do great casting and there are so many beautiful lines quotes in this movie which is very striking and made me cry hard now i bought my own copy on dvd and i always recommend it to everyone,1
8195,a lot of good things could have been done with this movie using essentially the same sets plot devices and storyline for example why not plant a seed of erica s capability before the murder of her lover why not develop erica and the cop s relationship slowly and convincingly maybe contrast eric s metamorphis by including some other post event facet relationship etc in her life that she now rejects why not have her injure an innocent bystander to underscore the wrongness in erica s actions instead tbo exploits the revenge fantasy to its maximum level giving insincere lip service to the don t do this at home messages thrown in only to allow the film to qualify as legitimate i m not a jodie foster fan after displaying some range in films like silence of the lambs nell and one where she plays the ordinary mother of a child prodigy foster has slipped into a succession of roles where she plays the same hard bitten badgered heroine single handedly overcoming evil such is fine once or twice but i m getting too used to her fight versus flight close up tbo could have used a younger actress or one that more convincingly embraced being a woman in her forties instead of 40 something foster playing a younger woman tbo is a movie with substantial actors financing and resources that manages to descend to junk,0
16590,i went in to this thinking another gross movie with gross humor telling from my first sentence i don t like that humor and this movie had it s moments but i loved it justin long has really never done comedy like this where he s sarcastic and clever and i loved it lewis black enough said the ending i really did love because it had to take itself seriously i mean how else would you end it yes it s another underdog story but not in your typical format and the movie wasn t their ups and downs it was people coming together for one common goal to go to college where they were accepted the cast was amazing and yes i did laugh at loud when i didn t think i would and the laughter lasted longer then i thought to the parents and sister played their roles well but their characters are put in when necessary the movie was not focused around them but at the same time they showed up when you expect and not expect them to they played in to the story very well and i loved the familiar faces anthony heald boston public jeremy howard i galaxy quest with justin long ross patterson the new guy and sam horrigan brink blake lively added her certain something to the movie which made it even more enjoyable as well as b s friends i recommend this movie to whoever hated those gross comedies of the last 4 years and really want something with humor and an actually story line,1
12714,this movie is great 80 s sleazy slasher movie about three kids born during an eclipse so they kill everyone they see the reason they kill makes practically no sense but it just adds to the charm of this movie and dang these kids are crazy especially curtis if you ve seen the movie you know who i am talking about that kid s vicous although the movie doesn t have much gore it is entertaining and for some reason you kind of care about the characters it also has some nice nudity has some decent acting as well really a decent 80 s slasher movie it s worth a look if you ever get the chance to see it you ll have nightmares about those darn kids though i guarantee you,1
14820,another good overcoming evil story but with a difference this includes learning self discipline when julie goes with her teacher to a zen monastery she learns about herself she also hones her karate skills when the zen monks visit the city some awkward and comical moments ensue not uproarious but entertaining nonetheless next karate kid has much to say about looking within and improving what is there as well as using what you have,1
16494,i ve read a lot of reviews about showtime on imdb and many seem to miss the mark i ve noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical buddy film de niro is in no way murphy s buddy throughout most of this movie in fact part of the comedy of this film is de niro s reluctance to be friends with anybody murphy really shines in this one he is back at doing what he does best acting like a complete ham he is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show de niro is perfect as the straight man who thinks the entire thing is stupid i thought the two of them had great chemistry and were a perfect casting choice rene russo is also great as the tv producer of course she loves everything murphy does and tries so hard along with murhpy to get deniro going too a lot of reviewers have touched on the hilarious scene with william shatner reprising his role as tj hooker to train murhpy de niro how to act like cops but my favorite scene involves murphy in the confessional hoping he could get a wesly snipes like cop to team up with instead of de niro man that was hilarious comedies often depend on your personal tastes sure you could poke holes in the plot most often you can with a comedy i was psyched to see the pairing of murphy and de niro i think it brought out the best in murphy which was nice to see him at the top of his game again i can only imagine it was a great honor for murphy to be paired with the great de niro rating 8 of 10 stars,1
13580,this film is amazing while not perfect by hollywood standards it encompasses a gentle look at the wide divide between rich and poor black and white that is true in many parts of the world it handles the audience with kid gloves while delivering a truthful look at societal problems the children are beautiful take special note of the young man who plays sipho the friendships that develop are universally true anyone can relate to the choices these young people have to make the influence of adults is interesting it appears to be taken from real life experiences as there are snip its of conversations and interactions much like a child would remember experiencing i would highly recommend this film,1
9208,this is a candidate for worst films i ve ever seen it wanted to be as shocking as silence of the lambs but has neither the style nor the wit of the aforementioned the make up is excellent the acting is pretty good but the story seems to drag on for years and the murders are so gruesome that they re more disturbing than entertaining,0
22130,this movie was hilarious it occasionally went too far but isn t that what we expect from them the theater roared with laughter and ooooooed at all the incredibly crazy stunts it s rude crude and occasionally frighteningly intense the whole gang is back and even more out of their minds which in turn provides for some great entertainment i don t want to give anything away but the little snippets of clips going around the net are nothing compared to what comes after this is a great movie to go see with friends try to see it with a big crowd you will not be disappointed just don t go with anyone who can t take it see above it will not go over well you can be sure of that but that s pretty obvious in the first place if you enjoyed the first one you will loooooove this one,1
6102,this is easily the worst adaptation of greek mythology i ve ever seen it utterly fails as an adaptation of the original myth inventing silly plot twists and reducing the 12 labours to 3 or 4 i think it makes up utterly needless things to try to integrate other myths in clumsy ways which bring into question the writers having ever read the myths like changing birds to harpies lions to sphinxes the oracle of delphi to tiresias and bulls to a pedantic version of proteus even integrating aspects never seen outside of sam raimi s entertaining series concerning his first marriage to a woman with the co opted name of one of the furies so it sounds appropriate to the period i could accept much of that but it also fails completely in pure film standards most painful is the dialogue leaden portentous pseudo shakespearean tripe it is a poor re interpretation of the myths making a sad attempt at the kind of post modern revisionism that crichton s the 13th warrior attempted in regards to the beowulf legend while still including the strictly mythological elements such as clear interference from the gods and magical super strength a sad sad failure of an entertainment experience who i m sure many of the quality actors involved regret deeply,0
10516,i really wanted to like this movie but i just couldn t it had the potential to be a really cool hip remake of a cool show but that s where it fell apart it was too hip too cool first of all all the cool lines and scenes were showcased in the preview trailers which i d seen lots of times and the editing was very disjointed so that the scenes didn t seem to flow together and they all seemed out of place claire danes who i love as an actress failed to make this her break through to the beyond high school acting roles the only bright spot was giovanni ribisi as pete his slightly stupid yet actually smart style was funny and refreshing overall though i d recommend just watching the previews instead of seeing the movie and wishing it was more,0
5415,well it certainly stunned me i can not believe that someone made another australian film that s even more boring than somersault the story is implausible the characters with the exception of friels and mailman s characters are unlikeable and wooden tom long possesses a vast array of facial expressions happy and not happy and the sex scenes which could have been very confronting and disturbingly erotic would have been at home in a low budget porno flick this is the first movie i have seen in 30 years of cinema going that has had me on the edge of my seat ready to get up and leave the best thing about this movie is the promotional poster,0
15920,overall the dad s army movie is very funny although the humour isn t quite as catchy and sparkly as in the tv and radio series so where does this leave us the viewers if you ve never seen dad s army then the movie is a good way of bringing yourself up to speed and getting hooked on the mad world of walmington o s the downside is that you might not get it because as i said the humour in the movie is a bit on the stolid side for dad s army buffs the movie holds nothing new as the story is more or less a cutup of the tv series but it s a unique chance of seeing your favourites in high def as compared to the shitty quality of the bbc video recordings the movie also features what must be the lamest holdup sequence in the history of the universe i can t make up my mind if that s a positive or a negative though,1
11867,if you think it s beautiful to be obsessive about who you are in love with then i can imagine giving it a good rating but i cannot imagine that this theme of obsessiveness and having little respect for others such as the way paulie treats the teachers who try to help her is anything you would want to teach your children yes it s also bad the way victoria treated paulie but guess what that s life isn t it a more important lesson to learn how to get past these disappointments and make the best of your life or is falling off the roof a better lesson to teach our children secondly when mary s father didn t show up for the dinner and paulie helped mary release her anger that mary even said she wished he were dead somehow i don t think this is a good message either that you deal with your disappointments through anger,0
21438,when in 1982 the thing came out to theaters everywhere it had a cold reception and very poor box office results becoming almost a failure in john carpenter s career as a horror director however time has proved that the thing was definitely not a failed project and that the disappointing commercial results were not the film s fault nowadays john carpenter s the thing has gained the appreciation it rightfully deserves and is considered by many horror fans as a horror classic and not without a reason as this new version of john w campbell jr s story who goes there previously adapted as the thing from another world is closer to the original tale and keeps a pessimistic feeling of dread and high doses of suspense in a masterfully crafted study about paranoia the plot of the thing begins in the winter of 1982 in a u s research station located in the remote territories of antarctica when the members of the crew notice a norwegian helicopter coming their way the two apparently insane pilots of the helicopter are trying to kill a husky dog who makes its way into the american base after the norwegians are killed accidentally the americans try to figure out what made them to be insane soon they ll discover that the husky dog the norwegians were hunting was not a normal dog but a creature able to mimic every living creature and not only that it has a tremendous hunger director john carpenter earned a place in history when in 1978 he directed the seminal slasher halloween where suspense and atmosphere were above gore and shock the thing could be seen as an evolution of that style as even when carpenter makes great use of rob bottin s special effects which were labeled by critics as repulsive on its day the film still focuses more on atmosphere and suspense rather than in the violent and very well done displays of gore the feeling of loneliness as well as the bad karma between the members of the crew increase the feeling of paranoia as anyone could be the thing even our main character r j macready kurt russell ending in a situation where nobody can be trusted this plot element was more faithful to the concept of the source novel and was blatantly ignored by the previous version not completely a bad thing just a big difference making this version feel less like a remake and more as a new conception of the source novel bill lancaster s script handles the characters with brilliant domain giving us enough to distinguish them but not too much to completely trust them making them an essential factor in the film s haunting feeling of dread that keeps running through the movie the mystery and the suspense are at the max as never one can tell who is the thing and who is normal enhancing the paranoia and unpredictability of the plot with excellent results the cast is very effective and their performances as a whole so effective that one can almost feel the bad feelings between their characters as real carpenter s regular collaborator kurt russell as macready carries the film and through his eyes we witness the madness and the horror the research station becomes as the situations goes worse definitely one of his best performances wilford brimley is also terrific as dr blair a scientist that goes insane after discovering the thing s purposes the thing is a film so wonderfully crafted that its flaws tend to go unnoticed although they exist the most notorious being the very low key and at times unappropriated score by ennio morricone it s not exactly bad but it just feels out of place at some scenes and it s not one of the best works by the legendary composer also due to some misshapes with the special effects some scenes were left out that actually fill some small plot holes although nothing of big importance or actually annoying when talking about john carpenter s films most people will almost instantly name halloween as his favorite film but personally i would go with the thing as i consider it carpenter s greatest achievement so far and one of the most interesting and actually scary horror films ever made i would go as far as to call it one of the finest films ever made 10 10,1
922,writer director robert downey sr a pioneer of the underground film movement in the 1960s satirized the new york madison avenue advertising world with his avant garde comedy putney swope downey doesn t confine his ridicule to advertising but tackles black militant culture the dynamics in hollywood s portrayal of race the elite white power structure and character of corruption in any power struggle as audacious and ambitious as putney swope strives to be it qualifies as a terrible film amateurishly made on a shoe string budget with a no name cast and humor that lacks hilarity everything about this movie reeks with improvisation putney swope stirred up controversy during its initial release with its politically incorrect handling of race issues and consumer culture like most marx brothers movies the plot is thin providing an excuse for downey s anecdotal gags most of which are terrible the chairman of a prestigious madison avenue ad agency dies during a board meeting before the body has been removed the board holds a secret ballot vote to determine who will replace him each member understands that they are forbidden to vote for himself sheer accident occurs when everyone votes for the token black member putney swope arnold johnson since none thought anybody would cast a ballot for him swope pink slips all but one of the white executives surrounds himself with black pistol packing employees and renames the firm truth and soul advertising swope decides to alter the face of american advertising he refuses to accept clients whose products are alcohol tobacco or war toys swope s clients stage an exodus after he becomes the ceo and grandstanding attracts a new line up of clients that show up at his office lugging bags of money and prepared to suffer abuse from swope s militant employees swope exploits his african american staff too ruthlessly appropriating their ideas after he fires them and conjures up a number of offensive advertising campaigns all of which are hailed as a new wave of marketing genius incredibly swope s conservatism proves successful but the agency becomes the target of government operatives who argue swope s advertising tactics constitute a threat to the national security the high point of this black white 85 minute comedy are the television commercials shot in color unfortunately downey doesn t know when to cut off these ads that consistently start out cleverly but wear out their welcome the funniest part of putney swope involves our eponymous protagonist s dealings with u s president mimeo in washington d c pepi hermine a marihuana toking midget with a kissinger like teutonic adviser larry wolf spouting tasteless jokes while trying to convince swope to come up with an advertising campaign for his new car the borman 6,0
5142,i gave this movie a rating of 1 because it is by far the worst movie i ve ever seen in my life this movie was made in 2003 and i ve seen movies made in the 60 s with better special effects i wish i could go into detail but words can t describe how crappy this movie was i could have done better with a home video camera and 20 i pray that chuck norris never makes a movie again now if you think i m downing this movie because it has a christian theme you re wrong i like the fact that il chuck decided to make a movie that at least attempted to make god look good but why would he make poor viewers like me suffer through such a crappy movie this whole film can be summed up in 3 words re damn diculous,0
5342,this movie sucked on so many levels ever seen the dentist this movie made the dentist look like a masterpiece i do not recommend this movie to anyone unless of course you are really really really really really bored then maybe it was so corny the killer reminds you of the grandpa from the monsters except he has goggles on when jessica said i want you to meet someone my inner bitch i thought she was going to kick his butt however all she did was throw a frig gen trash can at him i was very disappointed and when the ranger had the crying scene about his wife i so felt the pain behind his tears not so before watching this movie grab a blanket and a pillow get comfortable because it is very relaxing,0
17595,stuey unger was a card playing legend he was quoted in an interview as saying some day i suppose it s possible for someone to be a better no limit hold em player than me i doubt it but it could happen but i swear to you i don t see how anyone could ever play gin better than me there s a gin rummy scene in this movie that is so amazing you could have plopped it in x men as a showcase for a superhero s mutant power that s how incredible this man was i have a few minor problems with this movie as dark as this movie was stuey s real life was darker poker pro todd brunson said during the last world series of poker bob stupak mike sexton and i had a drink and talked about stu mike told us how he could barely talk hadn t showered in weeks and how his fingers were burned black by a crack pipe in the film michael imperioli looked far too healthy to be stu unger in the final years of his life when stuey won his last wsop he looked like a skeleton but let s face it this production lacked both the time and the deniro to make that kind of transformation my other problem was that i wish there was more poker playing with actual hands and situations sure it might have bored the average non poker enthusiast but it would have been nice for the hardcores too bad the movie wasn t 6 hours or so longer i watched the movie with 3 non poker players and they all thoroughly enjoyed it just like you don t have to be a former member of the colonial army to enjoy gibson s the patriot you don t have to be a poker player to see this gem can t wait for the dvd 8 out of 10,1
12545,when the circus comes to town and places the lion s cage directly over bugs bunny s home bugs ends up somewhere in the range right between freaked out and intrepid despite the title acrobatty bunny it s only at the end when bugs and the lion perform acrobatics but even leading up to that it s quite funny what bugs does to escape getting eaten somehow he always manages to use the other character s weakness against him and then pull any convenient object out of thin air bugs later ended up in the circus in big top bunny i liked this one better as the latter got drug down a little bit by giving the antagonist an eastern european accent i know that it was during the cold war but still i recommend this one and with the end we can affirm that it ll never be aloha oe for this cartoon,1
20228,good animation nice character design and a light hearted story make suzumiya haruhi no yuutsu enjoyable to watch after my first viewing i thought that this anime was pretty good but but was much better on for a second watch this is because it is done out of chronological order and once you re watch it in correct order you notice connections you didn t see before or it may be that you see a second meaning to some events you didn t notice before you may want to read the original novels not manga by tanigawa nagaru before after seeing this the anime is very good at visualizing every detail in the stories it shows however there are some short stories from the book that are not animated but are referenced to bamboo w wishes attached shown in episode 14 overall this anime is actually very good once after brief analyzation of the plot reading the book improves upon it as well it is a nice break from the shounen jump anime that seem to be taking over,1
12776,this movie was fabulous it is definitely a top 5 hitchcock film the directing and camera shots are nearly flawless aside from the dog scene when he licks the guys hand clearly in slow motion the plot is well written and realistic it was very believable that an innocent man could fall into a trap like that i would rate bruno as hitchcocks second most interesting character of course bates is first robert walker plays a very believable maniac he didnt overact the part which made it believable much the same how perkins didnt overact his part overall this is an excellent movie an absolute must see for any hitchcock fans,1
3900,how do stories this bad get made that s not a question it is a statement here are my problems with the film 1 much of the story development was predictable and boring my emotions ran pretty much in a flat line throughout there wasn t really much to draw the viewer into the film 2 the characters were decidedly uncharismatic one was a loon another was confusing and the third was pretty damned boring there was absolutely zero reason to be drawn to these people even though i knew it wouldn t happen i kept hoping that they would run into someone else someone more interesting 3 the physical environment was uncomfortable for me a trailer in the desert the desert is a place that most people would prefer not to visit how is it that these three people end up in the desert 4 and in the same desert did the writer really expect me to believe that the last three people on earth would manage to find each other within the span of a few weeks out in that desert 5 was it really necessary for ms ryan to be in two scenes that required a swimsuit hey she looks great but it was pretty gratuitous okay so if i thought it was so bad why did i give it a 3 i am trying to be as objective as possible even though i found alan annoying i have to say that david arnott did a very credible job of portraying a neurotic nerd the character reminded me of a few of albert brooks more annoying roles jeri ryan tried to do something with sarah but it just wasn t written very well okay so she was supposed to be a confused dysfunctional woman but why what did it add to the story her mood swings left me feeling like i was being jerked hard one way and then another and then another i don t often walk out on films but this one had me contemplating it several times stiff predictable boring proceed at your own risk my 2 cents,0
23287,this was one of the most emotional movies i have seen passion pleasure pain despair sorrow healing cleansing and love the entire movie was spellbinding everything was done so well the adaptation from the book the actors the sets the camera shots this movie touched me deeply in so many ways it reminded me of the despair that loosing your love can have and the time it takes to heal that wound you may love again but will always be risking the pain that comes with separation is this not one of the most important age old questions is it better to have love and lost than to never have loved before ascension,1
6893,i don t know how this movie has received so many positive comments one can call it artistic and beautifully filmed but those things don t make up for the empty plot that was filled with sexual innuendos i wish i had not wasted my time to watch this movie rather than being biographical it was a poor excuse for promoting strange and lewd behavior it was just another hollywood attempt to convince us that that kind of life is normal and ok from the very beginning i asked my self what was the point of this movie and i continued watching hoping that it would change and was quite disappointed that it continued in the same vein i am so glad i did not spend the money to see this in a theater,0
7245,the original road house was a classic cheesy 80s movie which although it didn t have anywhere near award worthy writing or acting was a very enjoyable and popular film largely due to the presence of star patrick swayze and the great supporting cast along with some excellent fight scenes and eye candy 16 years later and mgm sony attempts to re create the magic which left us all quoting one liners and reciting the three rules of bouncing with a movie which quotes all the original s best one liners and recites the three rules were this an amateur fan made film it would be seen as a loving homage to one of the most popular of swayze s movies as a professionally made film it falls flat on it s face right into the dvd bargin bin with its continual reuse of lines and plot from the original movie becoming more of an annoying sign of lack of originality rather than cool references to the original having said that with new lines such as i m gonna kill you just like i killed your father no wonder the screenwriters decided to rehash much of the original script i knew this was never going to be anything special being a straight to dvd sequel but i had at least hoped that there might be a couple of new ideas and fresh things included to live up to the road house name but what you get is simply just a 2006 remake of the same film with a little narcotics added in were i the director i d have removed all references to the first film so as not to tarnish the original and it s characters as it is we got patrick swayze s character now supposed to be dead killed off screen in a lame way by jake busey and his brother and son now the main characters who strangely enough have completely different surnames my favourite part was that dalton s son drove the same car his father did a genuinely cool homage although it was later ruined by having the car meet its end exactly the same way as its predecessor did that s a good example of how this film goes too far in including sequences and ideas from the 89 movie also of course who can forget the legendary moment where wild bill promises to kill shane just like i killed your father and then proceeds to attempt to dispatch him in a completely different manner amazing writing there i see schaech is listed as co screenwriter stick to acting or preferably nothing overall though this is an ok film if there s nothing else to watch and you want to turn your brain off for an hour and a half or if you haven t seen the first road house but hardcore fans of swayze s classic will be totally disappointed almost to the point of feeling insulting at how much of a rip off this movie is of the first as someone once suggested as an alternative subtitle for this film even jeff healy is glad he won t be seeing this one stick to the original road house and relive the good old swayze days,0
6544,the humor is non existent in this loser of a movie carrot top plays a surfer dude inventor who consistently blows the rent money on his goofy useless inventions then he helps an old guy broken down by the side of the road and voila he s inherited a major corporation and on and on and on past the jealous relatives humanizing the corporation hostile takeovers the obligatory love interest aargh let s just say this movie is virtually unwatchable what carrot top has accomplished is to convince me never to go to his stage shows,0
17264,i watched the premiere of path to paradise way back and was stunned by it dramatic license and all i lived in nyc brooklyn a few years and kept in mind today given the links to groups such as al queda hamas and the islamic jihad i see it as a warning not recognized by our government for that i place the blame on our bureaucracy and leaders 9 11 01 was a new tactic to behead two of our branches of gov t and there is no excuse for our gov t to prevent it period path to paradise was but a dramatic view of the 93 preview and no one cared now nearly 3 000 deaths later and years behind we struggle to find an answer that is decades to resolve,1
9687,i find it terribly ironic that left wing hollywood continues to hedge its bets making these awful lukewarm movies that neither condemn the war on terror nor embrace it if you re a sixties survivor and a committed pacifist and you re hoping for an all out condemnation of war like born on the fourth of july or all quiet on the western front this movie will really feel like a rip off none of these soldiers actually question this war or any war or the idea of war they just gripe about having to do another tour on the other hand if you re a patriotic american who wants to see a story of courage and honor this movie will really feel like a rip off none of these soldiers loves america or even loves the service the way they pout and sulk makes them come across more like suburban teenagers than blue collar tough guys it s not we were soldiers and it s not sands of iwo jima it s not even mindless action and the war scenes are less rambo and more buffy ryan philippe so completely cannot carry this kind of movie though he s devastatingly sexy in a rough trade men s room bisexual sort of way it s hard to picture him as a slow talking texas boy who wants to stand up and be counted this is no sgt croft in mailer s the naked and the dead he s more like joel in truman capote s other voices other rooms he can t sell you on the idea that he s been in combat and done his bit or that he wants his woman and wants her right now he fizzles on the battlefield and in the bedroom scenes looking as if he would much prefer to bend over and take a good stiff attack from the rear,0
17622,i just saw the big trail in vienna s filmmuseum for the first time immediately i was astonished by both the pictures optical high quality and unusual format and by its beautifully detailed story who has ever seen such a documentary style western with john wayne and there is so much time you can actually look around on the screen there is so much to see one is ever grateful that the scenes are often static because every single shot is so well composed and you want to take it it even the acting is good and fits in well the long running time of the picture is wonderful you don t want to miss a minute of it,1
14804,anastasia the mystery of anna was a two part star studded historical t v movie based on the peter kurth book anastasia the riddle of anna anderson it keeps up historically pretty much names are changed etc but sticks to the real story quite well omar sharif and claire bloom do quite well as the russian royals czar nicholas and czarina alexandra what stuck out in my mind was the all too short portrayals by rex harrison and olivia de havilland all in all it was a pretty classy production with some fine acting i was quite awestruck by the production values when it first aired on nbc in late 1986 also starring was the fine german actor jan niklas who had previously starred in nbc s other russian epic peter the great i felt that part 2 skipped over some important details of anna anderson s trip to america it s important to know too that in 1986 less was known about the anna anderson story back then it was still not known whether her claim to be the grand duchess anastasia was genuine by the late 1990 s more was known and anna anderson is now reputed to have been a fraud too bad the networks aren t making fine made for television movies like this anymore,1
13345,this film essentially contains all the elements of a great 70 s exploitation film except it was done in the late 80 s for the direct to video market you have a young couple in love but the whole world around them is involved either in crack dealing or gang violence when the boyfriend goes to jail the girlfriend ends up vulnerable to all the criminals who are everyone in this movie except for the cops first she gets hooked on crack by a dealer and then because he owes drug lord jim brown money she becomes brown s property then she s basically enslaved in a military style crack house that the movie is named for as if this isn t enough reason to see this movie you also have anthony geary playing a seemingly conservative school guidance counselor but he s really a major crack dealer in a sleazy yet hilarious scene he demands sexual favors from the heroine because she has no money for a fix in an earlier scene it was established that he is her counselor that scene and another where jim brown forces her to take a scalding hot shower because she stinks are hysterical lead actress cheryl kay was really good in this film tarantino bring her back it s not surprising to me that someone mentioned in another review that tarantino is a major fan of this it has just the right blend of comedy action sex romance and yes a central message to stay away from drugs jim brown s villainous turn here deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as another great 80 s b villain wings hauser in vice squad sometimes i think there should be a b movie oscars where performances like this could be acknowledged in the meantime let s hope that the modern straight to dvd filmmakers learn learn to use this same type of tongue in cheek humor,1
11797,in terms of historical accuracy this is the absolute worst roman film i have ever seen the list not only of errors but of plot ideas that are flat impossible would run longer than the three hour film but just to give you an idea julius caesar and augustus are presented as liberal democrats taking the side of the people against the nobles this is patently absurd the caesars were as noble as you could get their interest was in consolidating power and stabilizing a country that had been wrecked by 150 years of civil war there had been reformers notably the gracchi brothers who lived about 100 years earlier and to some extent advocated for the rights of ordinary citizens there are several scenes that are utterly ridiculous if you know anything about the period cleopatra with richard burton will give you a much better idea of how events unfolded fanciful though it is historical accuracy is one thing acting and dialogue are something else and here this film veers perilously close to being a bad junior high school production i burst out laughing several times especially when julia the daughter of augustus meets a lover they clutch passionately as she breathes my father ah your father your father your father would disapprove peter o toole is at his worst forced to gnaw his way through some very pompous and silly lines the actor who plays augustus as a young man is such a nebbish and the character is written as such it s impossible to envision him as the cunning crafty machiavellian politician who created the roman empire here he s just a whiner who has to be told what to do most of the time charlotte rampling does manage to emerge from an underwritten role as livia augustus s wife with dignity had she been given a fuller role to play she might have rescued this production from absurdity there is some nice photography and battle footage helped by plenty of standard issue cgi oddly this was made for british tv and appears to be a british italian co production but is labeled with an r rating the dvd picture is excellent and the dolby digital soundtrack is very nice although you only notice it during the few action sequences as the movie is mostly talk almost any roman movie even cleopatra or the fall of the roman empire has more historicity to say nothing of compelling drama than this bizarre classics illustrated jr adaptation this one gives new meaning to the much abused phrase based on a true story in this case they could have said suggested by real events,0
4729,ok i did think that it would be horrible but when i saw it i was proven wrong emily bergl did a superb job as did jason london sue snell was under used and under written the meanies were ok dylan bruno and rachel blanchard are definitely the stand outs as for the things the teens do and how people claim it s all wrong whatever my friends and i use the term swank a lot and i have driven a car and had someone steer as i changed it s pretty much all there i ve just never been at a after game party in a house that big with it s very own light show the deaths are good the best involves a pair of glasses a spear gun and a pool all in that order i must say there will be people who hate it but i m not one of them,0
21952,rko radio pictures made a real classic in 1947 and even managed to get it nominated for the best picture academy award the acting script continuity et cetera are all just about perfect and the story is well worth the viewer s 82 minutes although the picture soft petals the true life story by making the murder victim a jew rather than a homosexual most viewers will see the victim as a jewish homosexual such disguises never work perhaps weren t intended to i could nit pick about a few details but just for fun there was no all night movie house in washington dc in 1947 and if there was i wish robert mitchum and his pal wouldn t talk through the show there weren t any bars where a gi could pick up a pretty blonde none if robert ryan wanted to read the latest murder scoop he ought to have bought the daily news not the times hearald evening star and certainly not the know nothing washington post but these little things take nothing away from this classic the film benefits a lot from the absolute lack of a musical score except during the credits i ve only seen this done in a few films on the negative side since 1995 it comes with a tmc introduction where some liberal blabs about what the public was ready for in 1947 blah blah blah as if this fool has any business judging his betters i d say the ex gi s in 1947 the greatest generation were much smarter and had better values than some commentator film historian or other wise mouth in 1995 put a sock in it,1
24810,it s generally an accepted fact that marcel carn s 1936 1946 movies are masterpieces and it s considered polite to say that the rest are mediocrities this is an unfair opinion at least two of the latter era are eminently watchable th r se raquin his best post war work and les tricheurs the cheats there s a strange evolution from the prevert golden hour to les tricheurs in les enfants du paradis quai des brumes or le jour se l ve true love is thwarted by the villains in les tricheurs true love does not exist anymore we deal with a bunch of young people who believe in nothing falling in love would be incongruous for this youth the adults are not the villains at all mic s brother and mother are kind people but she is beyond their command very few grown ups appear anyway during two hours the characters do not stop playing around dancing listening to jazz records a music which was not still part of the bourgeois culture and heavily drinking when two of them discover they care for each others it will be too late the cast is rather good laurent terzieff as an existentialist cynic and andr a parisy as a rich kid are the stand outs on the other hand pascale petit and mainly jacques charrier who married brigitte bardot the same year as les tricheurs do not possess the ambiguity their parts ask for they are all smile too sweet and to nice to be believable oddly les tricheurs was labeled nouvelle vague when you know what the priests of this cinema school the likes of godard thought of carn it s really a good joke but this disenchantment you feel throughout the whole movie is really disturbing,1
23028,this movie is simply awesome it is so hilarious although the skating and other montages are played out the comedy is awesome raab himself and brandon dicamillo are hilarious there will be moments when you can t breath you re laughing so hard plus there are scenes that you can watch hundreds of times and still laugh this is one of the funniest comedies i ve ever seen,1
19375,the youth in us is a pitch perfect gem i saw this stunning short at this year s 2005 sundance festival the story took me on a profoundly transforming journey the directing by joshua leonard the acting of kelli garner and lukas haas the art direction the cinematography the score every element was true to the bone one can only hope that this exquisite and excruciating film is prelude to more great work from this gifted director just as a short film is shown before a feature at sundance commercial movie theatres used a similar format in times past it would be wonderful if miniature masterpieces like the youth in us could reach a wider audience this way,1
2733,my question is what was the worst element of this movie was it the acting directing script maybe it was the waste of alan ladd and jack larue larue and especially ladd are capable of bringing extreme sinisterness to a role in this movie it was hard to tell who the bad guy was granted ladd was playing an undercover good guy but even in his good guy roles he could be very chilling so the net result was a potentially good movie bereft of any feeling of conflict,0
10048,this failed exercise in satire or commentary on the human condition easily earned a place as one of the 10 worst movies i ve ever seen i m seriously considering buying a copy if i can find one dirt cheap to chase away unwanted company it s honestly that bad i view it as some kind of anti personnel weapon if you re the kind of person who just has to see a train wreck to witness the carnage then this movie is a gem just to be fair kelsey grammar s character has 1 line that almost works but doesn t quite other than that everything in this movie strives to be insightful but misses the mark by approximately the distance between earth and the nearest pair of colliding galaxies i usually can appreciate a book or movie where the protagonist suffers from some sort of existential angst but the angst presented here is so unbelievable and over the top and the movie doesn t even address the nonsense it presents in any valuable way if you are familiar with the term word vomit then you may get some picture of the cinematrocity oh and the narrative structure is ill conceived pretentious and amateurish it has failed on both style and substance if you really hate someone invite them over for a double feature of this movie and the terror of tiny town an all midget western from the 1930 s and put them in restraints with their eyes forced open a clockwork orange style but that probably violates some provision in the geneva conventions,0
14558,though this is a good enjoyable cartoon they did much better ones later on like carrotblanca this is almost like the first star trek feature which would have been welcomed with open arms and glee no matter what just for existing this is really a patchwork of old bits with some nice touches but nothing special reminds me a bit of the hunting trilogy in spots and the ending is priceless available and certainly well worth watching just for the novelty and the good bits recommended,1
14246,i ve been a fan of larry king s show for awhile i think he does a terrific job overall and i don t think he ever wusses out as so many people seem to believe he s a subtle scorpio he gets his zings in when he needs to just as he managed to do last night with paris hilton during her first post jail tv interview the thing about this entire case that has really amazed me is that hilton is still apparently clueless about why judge sauer gave her what she believes was a too harsh sentence and what s more actually made her serve it in all the time she was in jail supposedly alone 23 hours a day in her cell she never once in her mind rewound the events which led to her being given the sentence that judge sauer saw fit to impose on her she never once realized that it just might have set off a major red flag when she 1 showed up late in court for the original hearing and 2 proceeded to inform him when he asked her did she not know that her license had been suspended did she not get the papers in the mail that i have people who read that sort of thing for me all the time she was in her cell she never came to the realization that this action showing up late and that statement and more importantly the attitude the utter cavalier disregard for the court system and the law in general and her driving privileges in particular that she displayed just might have made judge sauer pardon the pun go sour on her last night on king s show after giving lip service to how she has been changed forever by her traumatic experience how she has learned her lesson she answered his question do you think you got a raw deal with a resounding yes and during the course of the conversation if you can call it that she said more than once that she did not feel she deserved what had happened to her king asked gently more than once if she does not feel she creates the situations in her life that she finds herself in to which she pretty much stared at him blankly she basically therefore holds the conscious belief that she s been victimized in this situation she does not understand how she herself caused it that day in court by her cavalier attitude with the judge i feel this is very sad tragic even considering what a huge role model hilton is to some people and it renders anything she said last night about her so called rehabilitated state into the realms of complete and utter cluelessness contradiction and hypocrisy during the course of the interview hilton alluded to spending a lot of time in her cell reading the bible at the end of the interview king scored major points by asking her what her favorite bible passage was she responded by groping perplexedly at her pathetic notes completely superficial non insights which she had read on air as if she were nelson mandella or something and finally grunting out i don t have a favorite passage judge sauer in my book is a hero and after last night so is larry king for subtly exposing hilton for what she truly is,1
